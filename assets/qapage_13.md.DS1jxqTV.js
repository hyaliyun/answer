He attended the University of Florida and then transferred to the University of Michigan Business School, where he earned his B.S. degree in accounting in 1962. He later received a Juris Doctor from the Wayne State School of Law in 1965 and an LL.M. degree in Taxation from the New York University School of Law in 1966.[12] These later degrees were financed by a loan from his uncle, the businessman Max Fisher,[11] who Ross has called, \\"the most important role model and inspiration for me in life\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss began his career as a tax attorney at Coopers & Lybrand in Detroit. In 1968, he moved to New York City and accepted a position as an assistant vice president in the real estate subsidiary of Laird Inc. and then worked in the corporate finance department of Bear Stearns. In 1972, he left employment and living off $10,000 lent to him by his mother,[14] he utilized his federal tax law knowledge to organize deals for wealthy investors allowing them to shelter income with the generous incentives granted by the federal government to promote the construction of federally subsidized affordable housing.[14] He was very successful, earning $150,000 in his first year,[14] and he was soon arranging more complicated transactions. Using his earnings along with his newfound experience, he started to develop real estate on his own and with an emphasis on high-quality architecture and engineering, he quickly earned a solid reputation in the American real estate arena. With a focus on the northeastern United States and Florida, he developed apartments, condominiums, retail, office parks and mixed-use developments. In 1972, he founded The Related Companies, a real estate development company.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated is an integrated and diversified real estate development company. Its business includes development, acquisitions, management, finance, marketing and sales. Headquartered in New York City, Related has offices and real estate developments in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San Francisco, South Florida, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai. The company directly employs approximately 2,000 people.[16]  The company's existing portfolio of real estate assets, valued at over $15 billion, is made up of mixed-use, residential, retail, office, trade show and affordable properties in what the company calls \\"premier high-barrier-to-entry markets.\\" Related is the largest owner of luxury residential rental properties in New York with over 5,000 units in its portfolio and has developed mixed-use projects such as Time Warner Center in New York and CityPlace in West Palm Beach and is currently developing the 26-acre Hudson Yards project[17] on Manhattan's west side.[18] Related also manages approximately $1.5 billion of equity capital on behalf of sovereign wealth funds, public pension plans, multi-managers, endowments, Taft-Hartley plans and family offices.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated also owns Equinox Fitness Clubs and a partnership interest in Union Square Events, the catering, culture, sports, and events business of Danny Meyer's Union Square Hospitality Group.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2008, Ross bought 50 percent of the Miami Dolphin franchise, Dolphin Stadium (now known as Hard Rock Stadium) and surrounding land from then-owner Wayne Huizenga for $550 million, with an agreement to later become the Dolphins' managing general partner. On January 20, 2009, Ross closed on the purchase of an additional 45% of the team from Wayne Huizenga. The total value of the deal was $1.1 billion.[20][21] This means Ross is now the owner of 95% of both the franchise and the stadium.  Ross announced his intention to keep Bill Parcells as the director of football operations.[3]  Parcells later stepped down from his position shortly before the 2010 NFL season.  Since buying the Dolphins, Ross has brought in Gloria Estefan, Marc Anthony, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams, as minority owners of the team.  In 2013, Ross made a push to obtain multimillion-dollar public funding from the state of Florida and Miami-Dade taxpayers to help renovate Hard Rock Stadium, the Dolphins' home field. After this effort failed in the Florida legislature, a team spokesman said that Ross does not intend to move the team but that under an eventual future owner the Dolphins' future in the Miami area is bleak.[22] Although Ross said he intends to keep the Dolphins \\"in town\\", there has been speculation that the team may seek to move out of Miami to a nearby locale such as Palm Beach.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nRSE Ventures is a private investment firm that focuses on sports and entertainment, media and marketing, food and lifestyle, and technology.

He is a trustee of New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Urban Land Institute, the NY Chapter of Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International, the Levin Institute and is a director of the Jackie Robinson Foundation and the World Resources Institute.[33] He also serves on the Executive Committee and is a trustee of Lincoln Center.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss was a major supporter and contributor to the 2012 presidential campaign of Mitt Romney.[9][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe serves on the Board for the Cornell Tech Campus,[35] a $2B redevelopment of Roosevelt Island including the Joan & Irwin Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, a partnership between Cornell University and the Technion ÿ Israel Institute of Technology that when completed will house several thousand post-graduate students, hundreds of faculty, and a high-tech business incubator.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 27, 2017, Ross cast the only \\"no\\" vote in the NFL owners' 31ÿ1 \\"yes\\" decision on the Oakland Raiders request for approval to move to Las Vegas starting in the 2019 season. Ross said he had no personal problems with Raiders owner Mark Davis and wished the franchise well, but did not think the Raiders did everything they could to stay in Oakland, and also that having 3 teams move within only 15 months (the Rams and Chargers both moved to Los Angeles) was not good for players or fans. Ross also stated prior to his Dolphins playing the Chargers in their first home game since the move to Los Angeles that he did not believe that Chargers owner Dean Spanos made his best effort to stay in San Diego, making him a popular figure with the betrayed San Diego fan base.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss invested in a partnership named RERI that was donated to the University of Michigan in 2003.  RERI obtained its own appraisal for the donation in the amount of $32,935,000.  The university sold the Ross-donated remainder interest in December, 2005 for $1.94 million, below the $6.5 million appraised value.  The IRS denied the entire $33 million tax deduction and imposed a multi million dollar penalty in July, 2017.  Ross's long time accountant Alan Katz and business associate, Harold Levine were instrumental in the partnership.  They are currently under criminal investigation for the tax plan.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the years, Ross has received numerous honors for his business, civic, and philanthropic activities.  He was named the third Most Powerful Person in New York Real Estate by the New York Observer, Multi-Family Property Executive of the Year by Commercial Property News, and Housing Person of the Year by the National Housing Conference.[38]   He also received The National Building Museum Honor Award, REBNY's Harry B. Helmsley Distinguished New Yorker Award and the Jack D. Weiler Award from UJA.  Crain's New York named Ross one of the 100 Most Influential Leaders in Business and he was recognized by NYC & Company with their Leadership in Tourism Award.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoss and his wife Kara Ross (ne Gaffney),[39] an entrepreneur and jewelry designer,[8][40][41] reside in New York with her two daughters from a previous marriage.[42] Ross has two of his own children from his first marriage.[42] The Rosses also own an 11,000 sq ft oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach named \\"The Reef\\".[43]","input":"Who is the owner of the miami dolphins?"},{"output":"18 or over","context":"Age of candidacy is the minimum age at which a person can legally qualify to hold certain elected government offices. In many cases, it also determines the age at which a person may be eligible to stand for an election or be granted ballot access.\\r\\nThe first known example of a law enforcing age of candidacy was the Lex Villia Annalis, a Roman law enacted in 180 BCE which set the minimum ages for senatorial magistrates.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany youth rights groups view current age of candidacy requirements as unjustified age discrimination.[2] Occasionally people who are younger than the minimum age will run for an office in protest of the requirement or because they don't know that the requirement exists. On extremely rare occasions, young people have been elected to offices they do not qualify for and have been deemed ineligible to assume the office.\\r\\nIn 1934, Rush Holt of West Virginia was elected to the Senate of the United States at the age of 29. Since the U.S. Constitution requires senators to be at least 30, Holt was forced to wait until his 30th birthday, six months after the start of the session, before being sworn in.[3]\\r\\nIn 1954, Richard Fulton won election to the Tennessee Senate. Shortly after being sworn in, Fulton was ousted from office because he was only 27 years old at the time. The Tennessee State Constitution required that senators be at least 30.[4] Rather than hold a new election, the previous incumbent, Clifford Allen, was allowed to resume his office for another term. Fulton went on to win the next State Senate election in 1956 and was later elected to the US House of Representatives where he served for 10 years.\\r\\nIn South Carolina, two Senators aged 24 were elected, but were too young according to the State Constitution: Mike Laughlin in 1969 and Bryan Dorn (later a US Congressman) in 1941. They were seated anyway.[5]\\r\\nOn several occasions, the Socialist Workers Party (USA) has nominated candidates too young to qualify for the offices they were running for. In 1972, Linda Jenness ran as the SWP presidential candidate, although she was only 31 at the time. Since the U.S. Constitution requires that the President and Vice President be at least 35 years old, Jenness was not able to receive ballot access in several states in which she otherwise qualified.[6] Despite this handicap, Jenness still received 83,380 votes.[7] In 2004, the SWP nominated Arrin Hawkins as the party's vice-presidential candidate, although she was only 28 at the time. Hawkins was also unable to receive ballot access in several states due to her age.[8]\\r\\nIn the United States, many groups have attempted to lower age of candidacy requirements in various states. In 1994, South Dakota voters rejected a ballot measure that would have lowered the age requirements to serve as a State Senator or State Representative from 30 to 18. In 1998, however, they approved a similar ballot measure that reduced the age requirements for those offices from 25 to 21. In 2002, Oregon voters rejected a ballot measure that would have reduced the age requirement to serve as a State Representative from 21 to 18.\\r\\nDuring the early 2000s, the British Youth Council and other groups successfully campaigned to lower age of candidacy requirements in the United Kingdom.[9] The age of candidacy was reduced from 21 to 18 in England, Wales and Scotland on 1 January 2007,[10] when section 17 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 entered into force.[11]\\r\\nIn Australia a person must be aged 18 or over to stand for election to public office at federal, state or local government level.\\r\\nThe youngest ever member of the House of Representatives was 20-year-old Wyatt Roy elected in the 2010 federal election after the Electoral Act 1918 was amended (in 1973) to reduce the age of candidacy for that office from 21 to 18.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Austria, a person must be 18 years of age or older to stand in elections to the European Parliament or National Council.[12] The Diets of regional L?nder are able to set a minimum age lower than 18 for candidacy in elections to the Diet itself as well as to municipal councils in the Land.[13] In presidential elections the candidacy age is 35.\\r\\nAny Belgian who has reached the age of 21 years can stand for election for the Chamber of Representatives, can become a member of the Senate, or can be elected in one of the regional parliaments.[citation needed] This is regulated in the Constitution and in the Special Law on the Reform of the Institutions.\\r\\nAccording to the Constitution of Belize, a person must be at least 18 years old to be elected as a member of the House of Representatives and must be at least 30 to be Speaker of the House.

Note that they are often photosynthetic plants, as no other source of energy (such as other species) except light energy is often available in the early stages of succession, thus making it less likely for a pioneer species to be non-photosynthetic. The plants that are often pioneer species also tend to be wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, as insects are unlikely to be present in the usually barren conditions in which pioneer species grow; however, pioneer species tend to reproduce asexually altogether, as the extreme or barren conditions present make it more favourable to reproduce asexually in order to increase reproductive success rather than invest energy into sexual reproduction. Pioneer species will die creating plant litter, and break down as \\"leaf mold\\" after some time, making new soil for secondary succession (see below), and nutrients for small fish and aquatic plants in adjacent bodies of water.[3]\\r\\nExamples of the plants and organism that colonize such areas are pioneer species:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPioneering fauna will colonize an area only after flora and fungi have inhabited the area. Soil fauna, ranging from microscopic protists to larger invertebrates, have a role in soil formation and nutrient cycling. Bacteria and fungi are the most important groups in the breakdown of organic detritus left by primary producing plants such as skeletal soil, moss and algae. Soil invertebrates enhance fungal activity by breaking down detritus. As soil develops, earthworms and ants alter soil characteristics. Worm burrows aerate soil and ant hills alter sediment particle size dispersal, altering soil character profoundly.\\r\\nThough vertebrates in general would not be considered pioneer species, there are exceptions. Natterjack toads are specialists in open, sparsely vegetated habitats which may be at an early seral stage.[6] Wide-ranging generalists visit early succession stage habitats, but are not obligate species of those habitats because they use a mosaic of different habitats.\\r\\nVertebrates can effect early seral stages. Herbivores may alter plant growth. Fossorial mammals could alter soil and plant community development. In a profound example, a seabird colony transfers considerable nitrogen into infertile soils, thereby altering plant growth. A keystone species may facilitate the introduction of pioneer species by creating new niches. For example, beavers may flood an area, allowing new species to immigrate.[7]\\r\\nPioneer species can also be found in secondary succession, such as an established ecosystem being reduced by an event such as: a forest fire, deforestation, or clearing; quickly colonizing open spaces which previously supported vegetation.[8]\\r\\nCommon examples of the plants in such areas include:[citation needed]","input":"What kind of problems would a pioneer species encounter?"},{"output":"33 of the 100 seats","context":"?????Rep. incumbent running ?????Rep. incumbent retiring\\r\\n?????Dem. incumbent running\\r\\n?????Ind. incumbent running\\r\\nMitch McConnell\\r\\nRepublican\\r\\nTBD\\r\\nTBD\\r\\nElections to the United States Senate will be held on November 6, 2018, with 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate being contested in regular elections whose winners will serve six-year terms from January 3, 2019, until January 3, 2025.

However, settlers would later discover that the wine made from the various native grapes, had flavors which were unfamiliar and which they did not like. This led to repeated efforts to grow familiar Vitis vinifera varieties. The first vines of Vitis vinifera origin were planted in Senecu in 1629, which is near the present day town of San Antonio, New Mexico.\\r\\nHowever, the discovery in 1802 of the native Catawba grape led to very successful wine-making in Ohio. By 1842 Nicholas Longworth was growing 1,200 acres (4.9?km2) of Catawba grapes and making the country's first Sparkling wine. In 1858, The Illustrated London News described Catawba as \\"a finer wine of the hock species and flavor than any hock that comes from the Rhine\\" and wrote that sparkling Catawba \\"transcends the Champagne of France.\\"[citation needed] But the successful operations in Ohio ceased when fungus disease destroyed the vineyards. Some growers responded by moving north to the shores of Lake Erie and its islands, where mildew was not a problem. The Finger Lakes region of New York State developed a successful wine-making industry beginning in the early 1860s when the Pleasant Valley Wine Company began using carefully selected derivatives of native grapes to produce wine. In 1865 the Urbana Wine Company (which marketed its wine under the Gold Seal label) was established. In 1872, O-Neh-Da Vineyard was established by the late Bishop Bernard McQuaid, on the shores of Hemlock Lake, to make pure grape wine for his churches. 1880 saw the establishment of the Taylor Wine Company. By the late 19th century, wines from the Finger Lakes were winning prizes at wine tastings in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn California, the first vineyard and winery was established by Spanish Catholic missionaries in 1769. California has two native grape varieties, but they make very poor quality wine. Therefore, the missionaries used the Mission grape, which is called Criolla or \\"colonialized European\\" in South America. Although a Vitis vinifera, it is a grape of \\"very modest\\" quality. The first secular vineyard was established in Los Angeles by an immigrant from Bordeaux, Jean-Louis Vignes. Dissatisfied with the Mission grape, he imported vines from France. By 1851 he had 40,000 vines under cultivation and was producing 1,000 US barrels (120,000?L) of wine per year.\\r\\nMajor wine production shifted to the Sonoma Valley in northern California largely because of its excellent climate for growing grapes. General Mariano Vallejo, former commander of the presidio of Sonoma, became the first large-scale winegrower in the valley. In 1857, Agoston Haraszthy bought 520 acres (2.1?km2) near Vallejo's vineyards. In contrast to Vallejo and most others, Haraszthy planted his vines on dry slopes and did not irrigate them. Today, the value of dry farming to creating superior wine is generally recognized.\\r\\nHaraszthy has been called the \\"Father of Modern Viticulture in California.\\" He wrote Report on Grapes and Wines in California, a manual on vineyard management and wine making procedures in which he urged experimentation with different grape varieties in different soils and different parts of the state. He also urged the government to collect cuttings from Europe and distribute them to growers in California. In 1861, the State Legislature commissioned Haraszthy to travel to Europe and purchase a diversity of grapevines. He did so, and obtained 100,000 vines of 300 different varieties.\\r\\nIn 1852, Charles LeFranc established what became the very successful Almaden Vineyards, where he planted Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir, Semillon, and many others. LeFranc produced good wine as did his son-in-law, Paul Masson. In 1854, John Patchett planted the first commercial vineyard in Napa Valley and established the first winery there in 1858.[1][2] In 1861 Charles Krug who previously had worked for Agoston Haraszthy and Patchett founded his namesake winery in St. Helena and began making his own wine.[3] Originally a Prussian political dissident, Krug learned the trade of the vintner as an apprentice to Haraszthy in the Sonoma Valley. The land on which Krug founded his winery was part of his wife's (Carolina Bale's) dowry. Krug became an important leader of winemaking in the Napa Valley. He was also a mentor for Karl Wente, Charles Wetmore and Jacob Beringer, all of whom became important vintners.\\r\\nEarly on, the Napa Valley demonstrated leadership in producing quality wine. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Napa Valley wines won 20 of the 34 medals or awards (including four gold medals) won by California entries. This was the high point that was followed by 40 years of natural and human-caused disasters. Severe frosts, the outbreak of the phylloxera louse which destroyed Vitis vinifera vines, an economic depression, the San Francisco earthquake that destroyed an estimated 30,000,000 US gallons (110,000,000?L) of wine in storage, and the disaster of national Prohibition from 1920 through 1933.\\r\\nSome wineries managed to survive by making wine for religious services. However, grape growers prospered. Because making up to 200 US gallons (760?L) of wine at home per year was legal, such production increased from an estimated 4,000,000 US gallons (15,000,000?L) before Prohibition to 90,000,000 US gallons (340,000,000?L) five years after the imposition of the law. Unfortunately, quality grapes do not ship well, so producers ripped out their vines and replaced them with tough but poor quality grapes such as Alicante Bouschet and Alicante Ganzin.\\r\\nFollowing Prohibition, American wine making reemerged in very poor condition. Many talented winemakers had died, vineyards had been neglected or replanted in poor quality grapes, and Prohibition had changed Americans' taste in wines. Consumers now demanded cheap \\"jug wine\\" (so-called dago red) and sweet, fortified (high alcohol) wine. Before Prohibition dry table wines outsold sweet wines by three to one, but after the ratio was more than reversed. In 1935, 81% of California's production was sweet wines. The reputation of the state's wines suffered accordingly.\\r\\nDuring the 1970s a system was established to identify appellations of origins, using the term American Viticultural Areas (AVA). An AVA guarantees that a minimum of 85% of the wine in the bottle comes from grapes grown in that AVA. The use of individual vineyard names guarantees that 95% of any wine using a vineyard name must be made from grapes grown in that vineyard, and from within a recognized AVA. There are 238 AVAs, of which 138 are in California[4].\\r\\nLeading the way out of the abyss was research conducted at the University of California, Davis. Faculty published reports on which varieties of grapes grew best in which regions of the state, held seminars on winemaking techniques, consulted with grape growers and winemakers, offered academic degrees in viticulture, and promoted the production of quality wines. The results of their success would be demonstrated decades later at the Paris wine tasting in 1976, the nation's 200th anniversary.","input":"Who planted the first vitis vinifera in the u.s. colonies?"},{"output":"Hamida Djandoubi","context":"Hamida Djandoubi (Arabic: ????? ???????; September 22, 1949 ÿ September 10, 1977) was a Tunisian agricultural worker and convicted murderer. He moved to Marseille, France, in 1968 and six years later he kidnapped, tortured and murdered 22-year-old lisabeth Bousquet, his former girlfriend. He was sentenced to death in February 1977 and executed by guillotine in September that year.

On July 3, 1974, he kidnapped Bousquet and took her into his home where, in full view of the terrified girls, he beat the woman before stubbing a lit cigarette all over her breasts and genital area. Bousquet survived the ordeal so he took her by car to the outskirts of Marseille and strangled her there.\\r\\nOn his return, Djandoubi warned the two girls to say nothing of what they had seen. Bousquet's body was discovered in a shed by a boy on July 7, 1974.

His main defense revolved around the supposed effects of the amputation of his leg six years earlier which his lawyer claimed had driven him to a paroxysm of alcohol abuse and violence, turning him into a different man.\\r\\nOn February 25 he was sentenced to death. An appeal against his sentence was rejected on June 9.

Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been amended many times, including \\"over twenty major changes\\" made by 2002.[3]\\r\\nThe Act is very wide-ranging in scope, covering governance, land use, healthcare, education, and more on Indian reserves. Notably, the original Indian Act does two things affecting all indigenous peoples in Canada:\\r\\nThe Act's existence is necessitated by the fact that First Nations (historically called \\"Indians\\") relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and various treaties, and because Canada's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal, rather than provincial governments, by the terms of Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Indian Act replaces any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation, creating a definitive national policy on the subject. The Act is not a treaty; it is Canada's legal response to the treaties. Nevertheless, its unilateral nature, imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties, is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn A Macdonald, 1887[5]\\r\\nThe Indian Act was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to Canadian Confederation, most notably the Gradual Civilization Act passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869.[5] The Indian Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which provides Canada's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to \\"Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians\\". It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British King George III in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, while at the same time enforcing Euro-Canadian standards of \\"civilization\\". The purpose of the act, as stated by its drafters, was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members: a process called enfranchisement.\\r\\nThe idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of Indian Act and survived in some form until 1985. Upon the introduction in 1857 by the Tach-Macdonald administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961, the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English.[6]\\r\\nReserves, under this legislation, were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights. \\"Enfranchisement\\" derives from the idea of \\"franchise\\", which has gradually been degraded as \\"vote\\". Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives, were expected to pay taxes and lived \\"off-reserve\\". By contrast, groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations. One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve.\\r\\nThe tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective, or tribe, by virtue of a Crown protectorate. Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls; for example, the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians. It was hoped through means of fiduciary duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity, but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the Gradual Civilization Act. The 1985 amendment to the Indian Act extinguished the idea of enfranchisement.\\r\\nUnder the section entitled \\"Reserves\\" in the Indian Act, it is stated that reserves are \\"to be held for use and benefit of Indians.[4]\\r\\n18. (1) \\"Subject to this Act, reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart, and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender, the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band. Marginal note:Use of reserves for schools, etc.\\"\\r\\n18. (2) \\"The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools, the administration of Indian affairs, Indian burial grounds, Indian health projects or, with the consent of the council of the band, for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band, and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes, but where an individual Indian, immediately prior to the taking, was entitled to the possession of those lands, compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian, in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister, or, failing agreement, as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct.\\"\\r\\nIn the Indian Act, updated to April 2013, the term \\"band\\",[4]\\r\\n\\"means a body of Indians (a) for whose use and benefit in common, lands, the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty, have been set apart before, on or after September 4, 1951, (b) for whose use and benefit in common, moneys are held by Her Majesty, or (c) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act.\\"\\r\\nFundamental to Canada's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are (e.g. who are the \\"Indians\\" of the Indian Act?), and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history. Not all people who self-identify as \\"Aboriginal\\" are considered \\"Indians\\" under the terms of the act. Only those on the official Indian Register maintained by the federal government (or a local \\"band list\\" in some cases) are Status Indians, subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the Indian Act. Notably this excludes Mtis people, Inuit people, and so-called Non-Status Indians. Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status. Many bands now maintain their own band lists.\\r\\nThough people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians, Bill C-31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to such members. The sections in question are those relating to community life (e.g., land holdings). Sections relating to Indians (Aboriginal people) as individuals (in this case, wills and taxation of personal property) were not included. Prior to 1985, Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following:\\r\\nThese provisions interfered with the matrilineal cultures of many First Nations, whereby children were born to the mother's clan and people, and gained their status in the tribe from her family. Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line.\\r\\nIn Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell (1974), these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the Canadian Bill of Rights. The Indian Act was amended in 1985 (Bill C-31)[4] to restore status to people who had lost it in one of these ways, and to their children.\\r\\nBonita Lawrence (2003)[9] discusses a feminist position on the relationship between federal definition and Indian identity in Canada. Until 1985, subsection 12(1)(b) of the act \\"discriminated against Indian women by stripping them and their descendants of their Indian status if they married a man without Indian status.\\"[10] Under subsection 12(2) of the act, \\"'illegitimate' children of status Indian women could also lose status if the alleged father was known not to be a status Indian and if the child's status as an Indian was \\"protested\\" by the Indian agent.\\" Further, subparagraph 12(1)(a)(iv), which Lawrence calls the \\"double mother\\" clause, \\"removed status from children when they reached the age of 21 if their mother and paternal grandmother did not have status before marriage.\\" Much of the discrimination stems from the Indian Act amendments and modifications in 1951.\\r\\nShe discusses the struggles of Jeannette Corbiere Lavell and Yvonne Bdard in the early 1970s, two women who had both lost their Indian status for marrying white men. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Indian Act was not discriminatory, as the pair gained the legal rights of white women at the same time they lost the status of Indian women, in a parallel to R. v. Drybones (supra). In 1981, Sandra Lovelace, a Maliseet woman from western New Brunswick forced the issue by taking her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, contending that she should not have to lose her own status by her marriage. The Canadian law was amended in 1985.[10]\\r\\nIn the 1951 amendments to the Indian Act, paragraph 12(1)(b) initiated that a status Indian woman who married a man who was not a status Indian became non-status.[11] Subjecting Aboriginal female status to that of their father or husband, the Canadian government applied gender bias requirements to the legal status of Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Without legal status, Aboriginal women are unable to access treaty benefits, practice inherent rights to live on their reserve, inherit family property or be buried on reserve with ancestors.[11] Restricted from access to their native community, Aboriginal women without legal status were unable to participate in ceremonies and rituals on their traditional land. However, these conditions did not apply to status Indian men who married non-status women; these men were able to keep their status.[11] Section 12, paragraph 1(b) of the Indian Act worked to disadvantage the position of Aboriginal women and can be considered an attempt to demolish Aboriginal families and alienate Aboriginal women from their land. Inflicting gender discriminatory laws the Canadian government marginalized and disadvantaged Aboriginal women. Section 12 gained the attention of female movements contributing to a variety of proposals for reform.[12] Amended in 1985 through the introduction of Bill C-31, section 12 was removed and status was reinstated to those affected.\\r\\nAs stated in Bill C-31 women who lost their status as a result of marrying a man who was not a status Indian can apply for reinstatement and regain status under subsection 6(1).[13] However, the children of reinstated women are subject to registration under subsection 6(2).[12] Aboriginal people registered under section 6(2) are unable to transmit status to future generations.[13] Thus, by reinstating women under section 6 of the Indian Act the Canadian government failed to completely remove gender discrimination from its legislation. Since, the children of reinstated women have restrictions on their status, and status Indian men continue to hold greater quality of status then women. Bill C-31 amendments create a new system for classifying status Indians that maintains gender discrimination.[13] Patriarchy continued to be inflicted on Aboriginal peoples in Canada even after the 1985 Indian Act amendments. Female movements expressed that Bill C-31 failed to eliminate all gender discrimination from the Indian Act, and in 2010 the Canadian government introduced Bill C-3 (Act to Promote Gender Equality in Indian Registration).[13]\\r\\nBill C-3 amendments to the Indian Act (Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act[14] - GEIRA) permitted Aboriginal women reinstated under subsection 6(2) to be eligible for 6(1) status.[15] Creating paragraph 6(1)(c.1) registration, reinstated Aboriginal women could only be eligible for registration under 6(1) if they had non-status children.[15] Since it was the children of Aboriginal women who had been affected by restrictions under subsection 6(2) legal registration, only women who had children were eligible to be registered under subsection 6(1) of the Indian Act. Continuing to place restrictions on the status of reinstated women, Bill C-3 does not remove all gender bias provisions from the Indian Act.\\r\\nAn 1884 amendment to the Act mandated education for Indian children, to bring them to read and write English. The now infamous Indian Residential School system subjected children to forced conversions, sickness, abuse and what has been described as an attempt at Genocide by the recent Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Canadian Indian residential school system can be seen as an attempt to force Indians off their lands, sever family ties and diminish traditional Indian culture, for which on 11 June 2008 the government of Canada apologized.[16]\\r\\nIn 1885 an amendment to the Indian Act banned the Potlach ceremony of the West Coast peoples. The Potlatch ban drove traditional ceremonies underground. A similar amendment in 1895 banned the Sun Dance of the Plains peoples, which was not lifted until 1951.\\r\\nA 1927 amendment (Section 141) forbid any first nation or band from retaining a lawyer for the purpose of making a claim against Canada, and further forbid them from raising money to retain a lawyer, on punishment of imprisonment.[17][18]\\r\\nSection 87 exempts Indians from paying taxes on two types of property: (a) the interest of an Indian or a band in reserve lands or surrendered lands; and (b) the personal property of an Indian or a band situated on a reserve[19]\\r\\nThe rights exclusive to Indians in the Indian Act [4] are beyond legal challenge under the Constitution Act, 1982. Section 25 of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms shall not be interpreted as negating Aboriginal, treaty or other rights of Canada's Aboriginal peoples.\\r\\nSection 88 of the Indian Act states that provincial laws may affect Aboriginals if they are of \\"general application\\", meaning that they affect other people as well as Aboriginals. Hence, provincial laws are incorporated into federal law, since otherwise the provincial laws would be unconstitutional.[20] In Kruger and al. v. The Queen (1978), the Supreme Court found that provincial laws with a more significant impact on Aboriginals than other people can be upheld, as \\"There are few laws which have a uniform impact.\\"\\r\\nConstitutional scholar Peter Hogg argues that in Dick v. The Queen (1985), the Supreme Court \\"changed its mind about the scope of s. 88.\\" Section 88 could now protect provincial laws relating to primary Aboriginal issues and even limiting Aboriginal rights.[21]\\r\\nNumerous failed attempts have been made by Canadian parliamentarians to repeal or replace the Indian Act without success. Those changes that have been made have been piecemeal reforms, rather than sweeping revisions.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, several pieces of legislation have been passed allowing individual bands to opt out of a particular section of the Indian Act if an agreement is signed between the band and the government putting alternative measures in place. These are called \\"Sectoral Legislative Arrangements\\". The band remains subject to the Act except for the section in question.\\r\\nThe 1895 amendment of the Indian Act (Section 114) criminalized many Aboriginal ceremonies, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of numerous Aboriginal people for practising their basic traditions.[35] These arrests were based on Aboriginal participation in festivals, dances and ceremonies that involved the wounding of animals or humans, or the giving away of money or goods. The Dakota people (Sioux) who settled in Oak River, Manitoba, in 1875 were known to conduct \\"give-away dances\\", also known as the \\"grass dance\\".[36] The dance ceremony involved the giving away and exchange of blankets and horses; thus it breached Section 114 of the Indian Act.[28] As a result, Wanduta, an elder of the Dakota community, was sentenced to four months of hard labour and imprisonment on January 26, 1903.[37]\\r\\nAccording to Canadian historian Constance Backhouse, the Aboriginal \\"give-away dances\\" were ceremonies more commonly known as potlatches that connected entire communities politically, economically and socially.[38] These dances affirmed kinship ties, provided elders with opportunities to pass on insight, legends and history to the next generation, and were a core part of Aboriginal resistance to assimilation.[38] It is estimated that between 1900 and 1904, 50 Aboriginal people were arrested and 20 were convicted for their involvement in such dances.[39] The Indian Act was amended in 1951 to allow religious ceremonies, including the \\"give-away dance\\".[28]\\r\\nIn R. v. Jim (1915), the British Columbia Supreme Court found that Aboriginal hunting on Indian reserves should be considered under federal jurisdiction under both the constitution and the Indian Act. The case involved whether Aboriginals were subject to provincial game laws when hunting on Indian reserves.\\r\\nThe act was at the centre of the 1969 Supreme Court case R. v. Drybones, regarding the conflict of a clause forbidding Indians to be drunk off the reserve with the Bill of Rights. The case is remembered for having been one of the few in which the Bill of Rights prevailed in application to Indian rights.\\r\\nIn Corbiere v. Canada (1999), voting rights on reserves were extended under Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.","input":"What was the purpose of the indian act?"},{"output":"6 August 1932","context":"\\r\\nThe Autobahn (German: Autobahn [??au?.to:.ba:n], plural Autobahnen) is the federal controlled-access highway system in Germany. The official German term is Bundesautobahn (plural Bundesautobahnen, abbreviated BAB), which translates as \\"federal motorway\\". The literal meaning of the word Bundesautobahn is \\"Federal Auto(mobile) Track\\".\\r\\nGerman autobahns have no federally mandated speed limit for some classes of vehicles.[1] However limits are posted (and enforced) in areas that are urbanized, substandard, accident-prone, or under construction. On speed-unrestricted stretches, an advisory speed limit (Richtgeschwindigkeit) of 130 kilometres per hour (81?mph) applies. While going faster is not illegal as such in the absence of a speed limit, it can cause an increased liability in the case of an accident; courts have ruled that an \\"ideal driver\\" who is exempt from absolute liability for \\"inevitable\\" tort under the law would not exceed Richtgeschwindigkeit.\\r\\nA 2008 estimate reported that 52% of the autobahn network had only the advisory speed limit, 15% had temporary speed limits due to weather or traffic conditions, and 33% had permanent speed limits.[2] Measurements from the German State of Brandenburg in 2006 showed average speeds of 142?km/h (88?mph) on a 6-lane section of autobahn in free-flowing conditions.[3]\\r\\nGermany's autobahn network has a total length of about 12,993 kilometres (8,073?mi) in 2016,[4] which ranks it among the most dense and longest controlled-access systems in the world. Longer similar systems can be found in the United States (77,017 kilometres (47,856?mi))[citation needed] and in China (123,000 kilometres (76,000?mi)).[5][citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly federally built controlled-access highways with certain construction standards including at least two lanes per direction are called Bundesautobahn. They have their own, white-on-blue signs and numbering system. In the 1930s, when construction began on the system, the official name was Reichsautobahn. Various other controlled-access highways exist on the federal (Bundesstra?e), state (Landesstra?e), district, and municipal level but are not part of the Autobahn network and are officially referred to as Kraftfahrstra?e (with rare exceptions, like A 995 Munich-GiesingÿBrunntal). These highways are considered autobahn?hnlich (autobahnÿlike) and are sometimes colloquially called Gelbe Autobahn (yellow autobahn) because most of them are Bundesstra?en (federal highways) with yellow signs. Some controlled-access highways are classified as \\"Bundesautobahn\\" in spite of not meeting the autobahn construction standard (for example the A 62 near Pirmasens).\\r\\nSimilar to high-speed motorways in other countries, autobahns have multiple lanes of traffic in each direction, separated by a central barrier with grade-separated junctions and access restricted to motor vehicles with a top speed of more than 60?km/h (37?mph). Nearly all exits are to the right. The earliest motorways were flanked by shoulders about 60 centimetres (24?in) in width, constructed of varying materials; right-hand shoulders on many autobahns were later retrofitted to 120 centimetres (47?in) in width when it was realized cars needed the additional space to pull off the autobahn safely. In the postwar years, a thicker asphaltic concrete cross-section with full paved hard shoulders came into general use. The top design speed was approximately 160?km/h (99?mph) in flat country but lower design speeds were used in hilly or mountainous terrain. A flat-country autobahn that was constructed to meet standards during the Nazi period, could support the speed of up to 150?km/h (93?mph) on curves.\\r\\nThe current autobahn numbering system in use in Germany was introduced in 1974. All autobahns are named by using the capital letter A, which simply stands for \\"Autobahn\\" followed by a blank and a number (for example A?8). The main autobahns going all across Germany have a single digit number. Shorter autobahns that are of regional importance (e.g. connecting two major cities or regions within Germany) have a double digit number (e.g. A?24, connecting Berlin and Hamburg). The system is as follows:\\r\\nThere are also some very short autobahns built just for local traffic (e.g. ring roads or the A?555 from Cologne to Bonn) that usually have three digits for numbering. The first digit used is similar to the system above, depending on the region. East-west routes are always even-numbered, north-south routes are always odd-numbered.\\r\\nThe north-south autobahns are generally numbered using odd numbers from west to east; that is to say, the more easterly roads are given higher numbers. Similarly, the east-west routes are numbered using even numbers from north (lower numbers) to south (higher numbers).\\r\\nThe idea for the construction of the autobahn was first conceived in the mid-1920s during the days of the Weimar Republic, but the construction was slow, and most projected sections did not progress much beyond the planning stage due to economic problems and a lack of political support. One project was the private initiative HaFraBa which planned a \\"car only road\\" crossing Germany from Hamburg in the north via central Frankfurt am Main to Basel in Switzerland. Parts of the HaFraBa were completed in the late 1930s and early 1940s, but construction eventually was halted by World War II. The first public road of this kind was completed in 1932 between Cologne and Bonn and opened by Konrad Adenauer (Lord Mayor of Cologne and future Chancellor of West Germany) on 6 August 1932.[6] Today, that road is the Bundesautobahn 555.[7][8][9] This road was not yet called Autobahn and lacked a center median like modern motorways, but instead was termed a Kraftfahrstra?e (\\"motor vehicle road\\") with two lanes each direction without intersections, pedestrians, bicycles, or animal-powered transportation.[10]\\r\\nJust days after the 1933 Nazi takeover, Adolf Hitler enthusiastically embraced an ambitious autobahn construction project, appointing Fritz Todt, the Inspector General of German Road Construction, to lead it. By 1936, 130,000 workers were directly employed in construction, as well as an additional 270,000 in the supply chain for construction equipment, steel, concrete, signage, maintenance equipment, etc. In rural areas, new camps to house the workers were built near construction sites.[11] The job creation program aspect was not especially important because full employment was almost reached by 1936. The autobahns were not primarily intended as major infrastructure improvement of special value to the military as often stated. Their military value was limited as all major military transports in Germany were done by train to save fuel. The propaganda ministry turned the construction of the autobahns into a major media event that attracted international attention.[12]\\r\\nThe autobahns formed the first limited-access, high-speed road network in the world, with the first section from Frankfurt am Main to Darmstadt opening in 1935. This straight section was used for high speed record attempts by the Grand Prix racing teams of Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union until a fatal accident involving popular German race driver Bernd Rosemeyer in early 1938. The world record of 432?km/h (268?mph) set by Rudolf Caracciola on this stretch just prior to the accident remains one of the highest speeds ever achieved on a public motorway. A similar intent in the 1930s existed for a ten kilometer stretch of what is today Bundesautobahn 9 just south of Dessau? called the Dessauer Rennstrecke? had bridges with no piers, meant for land speed record cars like the Mercedes-Benz T80 to have made a record attempt in January 1940, abandoned due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe four months earlier.\\r\\nDuring World War II, the median strips of some autobahns were paved over to allow their conversion into auxiliary airstrips. Aircraft were either stashed in numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods. However, for the most part during the war, the autobahns were not militarily significant. Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and caterpillar tracks damaged the road surface. The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance. As a result, most military and economic freight was carried by rail. After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.[13][14]\\r\\nIn West Germany (FRG), most existing autobahns were repaired soon after the war. During the 1950s, the West German government restarted the construction program. It invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones. Finishing the incomplete sections took longer, with some stretches opened to traffic by the 1980s. Some sections cut by the Iron Curtain in 1945 were only completed after German reunification in 1990. Others were never completed, as more advantageous routes were found. Some of these incomplete sections to this very day stretch across the landscape forming a unique type of modern ruin, often easily visible on satellite photographs.\\r\\nThe autobahns of East Germany (GDR) were neglected in comparison to those in West Germany after 1945. East German autobahns were used primarily for GDR military traffic and for state-owned farming or manufacturing vehicles. The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was 100?km/h; however, lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to poor or quickly changing road conditions. The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the Volkspolizei, whose patrol cars were frequently found hiding under camouflage tarpaulins waiting for speeders.\\r\\nThe last four kilometers of remaining original Reichsautobahn, a section of A 11 northeast of Berlin near Gartz built in 1936? the westernmost remainder of the never-finished Berlinka? are scheduled for replacement around 2015.[15][16] Roadway condition is described as \\"deplorable\\"; the 25-metre-long concrete slabs, too long for proper expansion, are cracking under the weight of the traffic as well as the weather.[17]\\r\\nThe first autobahn in Austria was the West Autobahn from Wals near Salzburg to Vienna. Building started by command of Adolf Hitler shortly after the Anschluss in 1938. It extended the Reichsautobahn 26 from Munich (the present-day A8), however only 16.8?km (10.4?mi) including the branch-off of the planned Tauern Autobahn was opened to the public on 13 September 1941.[18] Construction works discontinued the next year and were not resumed until 1955.\\r\\nThere are sections of the former German Reichsautobahn system in the former eastern territories of Germany, i.e. East Prussia, Farther Pomerania and Silesia; these territories became parts of Poland and the Soviet Union with the implementation of the OderÿNeisse line after World War II. Parts of the planned autobahn from Berlin to K?nigsberg (the Berlinka) were completed as far as Stettin (Szczecin) on 27 September 1936. After the war, they were incorporated as the A6 autostrada of the Polish motorway network. A single-carriageway section of the Berlinka east of the former \\"Polish Corridor\\" and the Free City of Danzig opened in 1938; today it forms the Polish S22 expressway from Elbl?g (Elbing) to the border with the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast, where it is continued by the R516 regional road. Also on 27 September 1936, a section from Breslau (Wroc?aw) to Liegnitz (Legnica) in Silesia was inaugurated, which today is part of the Polish A4 autostrada, followed by the (single vehicle) Reichsautobahn 9 from Bunzlau (Boles?awiec) to Sagan (?aga) the next year, today part of the Polish A18 autostrada.\\r\\nAfter the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, plans for a motorway connecting Breslau with Vienna via Brno (Brnn) in the \\"Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\\" were carried out from 1939 until construction works discontinued in 1942. A section of the former Strecke 88 near Brno is today part of the R52 expressway of the Czech Republic.\\r\\nAs of 2016[update], Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about 12,993?km. From 2009 Germany has embarked on a massive widening and rehabilitation project, expanding the lane count of many of its major arterial routes, such as the A5 in the southwest and A8 going east-west.\\r\\nMost sections of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing two or three, sometimes four lanes in addition to an emergency lane (hard shoulder). A few other sections remain in an old state, with two lanes, no emergency lane, and short slip-roads and ramps.\\r\\nAbout 16,000 emergency telephones are distributed at regular intervals all along the autobahn network, with triangular stickers on the armco barriers pointing the way to the nearest one. Despite the increasing use of mobile phones, there are still some 700 calls made each day on average.\\r\\nFor the Emergency service or Roadside assistance to come to the right location, the road kilometer must be given as part of the emergency call.[19]\\r\\nFor breaks during longer journeys, parking sites, rest areas and truck stops are distributed over the complete Autobahn network. Parking on the autobahn is prohibited in the strictest terms outside these designated areas. There is a distinction between \\"managed\\" and \\"unmanaged\\" rest areas. (German: bewirtschaftet / unbewirtschaftet).\\r\\nUnmanaged rest areas are basically only parking spaces, sometimes with toilets. They form a part of the German highway system; the plots of land are federal property. Autobahn exits leading to such parking areas are marked 200 metres in advance with a blue sign with the white letter \\"P\\". They are found every few kilometres.\\r\\nA managed rest area (German: Autobahnrastst?tte or Rastst?tte for short) usually also includes a filling station, charging station, lavatories, toilets and baby changes. Many rest areas also have restaurants, shops, public telephones, internet access and a playground. Some have hotels. Mandated every 50?km or so, rest areas are usually open all night.\\r\\nBoth kinds of rest areas are directly on the autobahn, with their own exits, and any service roads connecting them to the rest of the road network are usually closed to general traffic. The autobahn must not be left at rest areas.\\r\\nTruck stops (German Autohof, plural Autoh?fe) are far rarer. Located at general exits, usually at a small distance from the autobahn, they have no ramps of their own.\\r\\nRest areas and truck stops are marked several times, starting several kilometres in advance, and with larger signs that often include icons announcing what kinds of facilities travellers can expect.\\r\\nGermany's autobahns are famous for being among the few public roads in the world without blanket speed limits for cars and motorcycles. As such, they are important German cultural identifiers, \\"... often mentioned in hushed, reverential tones by motoring enthusiasts and looked at with a mix of awe and terror by outsiders.\\"[1] Some speed limits are implemented on different autobahns.[21]\\r\\nCertain limits are imposed on some classes of vehicles:\\r\\nAdditionally, speed limits are posted at most on- and off-ramps and interchanges[23] and other danger points like sections under construction or in need of repair.\\r\\nWhere no general limit is required, the advisory speed limit is 130?km/h (81?mph), referred to in German as the Richtgeschwindigkeit. The advisory speed is not enforceable; however, being involved in an accident driving at higher speeds can lead to the driver being deemed at least partially responsible due to \\"increased operating danger\\" (Erh?hte Betriebsgefahr).\\r\\nThe Federal Highway Research Institute (Bundesanstalt fr Stra?enwesen) solicited information about speed regulations on autobahns from the sixteen States and reported the following, comparing the years 2006 and 2008:\\r\\nExcept at construction sites, the general speed limits, where they apply, are usually between 100?km/h (62?mph) and 130?km/h (81?mph); construction sites usually have a speed limit of 80?km/h (50?mph) but the limit may be as low as 60?km/h (37?mph).[25] In rare cases, sections may have limits of 40?km/h (25?mph),[26] or on one ramp 30?km/h (19?mph).[27] Certain stretches have lower speed limits during wet weather. Some areas have a speed limit of 120?km/h (75?mph) in order to reduce noise pollution during overnight hours (usually 10pm?ÿ 6am) or because of increased traffic during daytime (6am?ÿ 8pm).\\r\\nSome limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise. Limits can also be temporarily put into place through dynamic traffic guidance systems that display the according message. More than half of the total length of the German autobahn network has no speed limit, about one third has a permanent limit, and the remaining parts have a temporary or conditional limit.\\r\\nSome cars with very powerful engines can reach speeds of well over 300?km/h (190?mph). Major German car manufacturers, except Porsche, follow a gentlemen's agreement by electronically limiting the top speeds of their cars?ÿ with the exception of some top of the range models or engines?ÿ to 250?km/h (155?mph).[28] These limiters can be deactivated, so speeds up to 300?km/h (190?mph) might arise on the German autobahn, but due to other traffic, such speeds are generally not attainable. Most unlimited sections of the autobahn are located outside densely populated areas.\\r\\nVehicles with a top speed less than 60?km/h (37?mph) (such as quads, low-end microcars, and agricultural/construction equipment) are not allowed to use the autobahn, nor are motorcycles and scooters with low engine capacity regardless of top speed (mainly applicable to mopeds which are typically limited to 25 or 45?km/h anyway). To comply with this limit, heavy-duty trucks in Germany (e.g. mobile cranes, tank transporters etc.) often have a maximum design speed of 62?km/h (39?mph) (usually denoted by a round black-on-white sign with \\"62\\" on it), along with flashing orange beacons to warn approaching cars that they are travelling slowly. There is no general minimum speed but drivers are not allowed to drive at an unnecessarily low speed as this would lead to significant traffic disturbance and an increased collision risk.\\r\\nGerman national speed limits have a historical association[29] with war-time restrictions and deprivations, the Nazi era, and the Soviet era in East Germany. \\"Free driving for free citizens\\" (\\"freie Fahrt fr freie Brger\\"), a slogan promoted by the German Auto Club since the 1970s,[30] is a popular slogan among those opposing autobahn speed restrictions.[31][32][33] Tarek Al-Wazir, head of the Green Party in Hesse, and currently the Hessian Transport Minister has stated that \\"the speed limit in Germany has a similar status as the right to bear arms in the American debate... At some point, a speed limit will become reality here, and soon we will not be able to remember the time before. It's like the smoking ban in restaurants.\\"[34]\\r\\nThe Weimar Republic had no federally required speed limits. The first crossroads-free road for motorized vehicles only, now A555 between Bonn and Cologne, had a 120?km/h (75?mph) limit when it opened in 1932.[35] In October 1939, the Nazis instituted the first national maximum speed limit, throttling speeds to 80?km/h (50?mph) in order to conserve gasoline for the war effort.[36] After the war, the four Allied occupation zones established their own speed limits until the divided East German and West German republics were constituted in 1949; initially, the Nazi speed limits were restored in both East and West Germany.[37]\\r\\nIn December 1952 the West German legislature voted to abolish all national speed limits, seeing them as Nazi relics,[38] reverting to State-level decisions. National limits were reestablished incrementally. The 50?km/h (31?mph) urban limit was enacted in 1956, effective in 1957.[39] The 100?km/h (62?mph) limit on rural roadsexcept autobahnsbecame effective in 1972.\\r\\nJust prior to the 1973 oil crisis, Germany, Switzerland,[40] and Austria[41][42] all had no general speed restriction on autobahns. During the crisis, like other nations, Germany imposed temporary speed restrictions; for example, 100?km/h (62?mph) on autobahns effective November 13, 1973.[43] Automakers projected a 20% plunge in sales, which they attributed in part to the lowered speed limits.[44] The 100?km/h limit championed by Transportation Minister Lauritz Lauritzen lasted 111 days.[45] Adjacent nations with unlimited speed autobahns, Austria[41][42] and Switzerland,[40] imposed permanent 130?km/h (81?mph) limits after the crisis.\\r\\nHowever, after the crisis eased in 1974, the upper house of the German parliament, which was controlled by conservative parties, successfully resisted the imposition of a permanent mandatory limit supported by Chancellor Brandt.[46] The upper house insisted on a 130?km/h (81?mph) recommended limit until a thorough study of the effects of a mandatory limit could be conducted.[47] Accordingly, the Federal Highway Research Institute conducted a multiple-year experiment, switching between mandatory and recommended limits on two test stretches of autobahn. In the final report issued in 1977, the Institute stated the mandatory speed limit could reduce the autobahn death toll but there would be economic impacts, so a political decision had to be made due to the trade-offs involved.[48] At that time, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit.[49] The fatality rate trend on the German autobahn mirrored those of other nations' motorways that imposed a general speed limit.[50]\\r\\nIn the mid-1980s, acid rain and sudden forest destruction renewed debate on whether or not a general speed limit should be imposed on autobahns.[51][52] A car's fuel consumption increases with high speed, and fuel conservation is a key factor in reducing air pollution. Environmentalists argued that enforcing limits of 100?km/h (62?mph) limit on autobahns and 80?km/h (50?mph) on other rural roads would save lives as well as the forest, reducing the annual death toll by 30% (250 lives) on autobahns and 15% (1000 lives) on rural roads;[53] the German motor vehicle death toll was about 10,000 at the time.[54] The Federal Government sponsored a large-scale experiment with a 100?km/h (62?mph) speed limit in order to measure the impact of reduced speeds on emissions and compliance.[55] Afterward, again, the Federal Government declined to impose a mandatory limit, deciding the modest measured emission reduction would have no meaningful effect on forest loss.[56] By 1987 all restrictions on test sections had been removed, even in Hesse where the state government was controlled by a \\"red-green\\" coalition.[57]\\r\\nPrior to German reunification in 1990, eastern German states focused on restrictive traffic regulation such as a 100?km/h (62?mph) autobahn speed limit and of 80?km/h (50?mph) on other rural roads. Within two years after the opening, availability of high-powered vehicles and a 54% increase in motorized traffic led to a doubling of annual traffic deaths,[58] despite \\"interim arrangements [which] involved the continuation of the speed limit of 100?km/h (62?mph) on autobahns and of 80?km/h (50?mph) outside cities\\". An extensive program of the four Es (enforcement, education, engineering, and emergency response) brought the number of traffic deaths back to pre-unification levels after a decade of effort while traffic regulations were conformed to western standards (e.g., 130?km/h (81?mph) freeway advisory limit, 100?km/h (62?mph) on other rural roads, and 0.05 percent BAC).[59]\\r\\nIn 1993, the Social democratic-Green Party coalition controlling the State of Hesse experimented with a 90?km/h (56?mph) limit on autobahns and 80?km/h (50?mph) on other rural roads.[60] These limits were attempts to reduce ozone pollution.\\r\\nDuring his term of office (1998 to 2005) as Chancellor of Germany, Gerhard Schr?der opposed an autobahn speed limit, famously referring to Germany as an Autofahrernation (a \\"nation of drivers\\").\\r\\nIn October 2007, at a party congress held by the Social Democratic Party of Germany, delegates narrowly approved a proposal to introduce a blanket speed limit of 130?km/h (81?mph) on all German autobahns.[61] While this initiative is primarily a part of the SPD's general strategic outline for the future and, according to practices, not necessarily meant to affect immediate government policy, the proposal had stirred up a debate once again; Germany's chancellor since 2005, Angela Merkel, and leading cabinet members expressed outspoken disapproval of such a measure.[62]\\r\\nIn 2008, the Social Democratic-Green Party coalition controlling Germany's smallest State, the paired City-State of Bremen & Bremerhaven, imposed a 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph) limit on its last 11 kilometres (6.8?mi) of speed-unlimited autobahn[63] in hopes of leading other States to do likewise.[64]\\r\\nIn 2011, the first ever Green minister-president of any German state, Winfried Kretschmann of Baden-Wrttemberg initially argued for a similar, state-level 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph) limit.[65] However, Baden-Wrttemberg is an important location for the German motor industry, including the headquarters of Daimler AG and Porsche;[66] the ruling coalition ultimately decided against a state-level limit on its 675 kilometres (419?mi) of speed-unlimited roadsarguing for nationwide speed limit instead.[67][68][69]\\r\\nIn 2014, the conservative-liberal ruling coalition of Saxony confirmed its rejection of a general speed limit on autobahns, instead advocating dynamic traffic controls where appropriate.[70] Between 2010 and 2014 in the State of Hesse, transportation ministers Dieter Posch[71] and his successor[72] Florian Rentsch,[73] both members of the Free Democratic Party, removed or raised speed limits on several sections of autobahn following regular 5-year reviews of speed limit effectiveness; some sections just prior to the installation of Tarek Al-Wazir (Green Party) as Transportation Minister in January 2014[74][75] as part of an uneasy CDU-green coalition government. In 2015, the left-green coalition government of Thuringia declared that a general autobahn limit was a Federal matter; Thuringia would not unlaterally impose a general Statewide limit, although the Thuringian environmental minister had recommended a 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph) limit.[76]\\r\\nIn late 2015, Winfried Hermann, Baden-Wrttemberg's Green minister of transportation, promised to impose a trial speed limit of 120 kilometres per hour (75?mph) on about 10% of the state's autobahns beginning in May 2016;.[77] However the ruling green-social democratic coalition lost its majority in the March 2016 elections;[78] while Mr Hermann retained his post in the new Green ÿ Christian Democratic government, he put aside preparations for a speed limit due to opposition from his new coalition partners.[79]\\r\\nIn 2014, autobahns carried 31% of motorized road traffic while accounting for 11% of Germany's traffic deaths. The autobahn fatality rate of 1.6 deaths per billion-travel-kilometers compared favorably with the 4.6 rate on urban streets and 6.5 rate on rural roads.[54]\\r\\nBetween 1970 and 2010, overall German road fatalities decreased by almost 80% from 19,193 to 3,648; over the same time period, autobahn deaths halved from 945 to 430 deaths.[54] Statistics for 2013 show total German traffic deaths had declined to the lowest count ever recorded: 3,340 (428 on autobahns); a representative of the Federal Statistical Office attributed the general decline to harsh winter weather that delayed the start of the motorcycle-riding season.[54][80] In 2014, there was a total of 3,377 road fatalities, while autobahn deaths dropped to 375.[81]\\r\\n* per 1,000,000,000 travel-kilometres\\r\\nIn 2012, the leading cause of autobahn accidents was \\"excessive speed (for conditions)\\": 6,587 so-called \\"speed related\\" crashes claimed the lives of 179 people, which represents almost half (46.3%) of 387 autobahn fatalities that year.[82] However, \\"excessive speed\\" does not mean that a speed limit has been exceeded, but that police determined at least one party travelled too fast for existing road[83] or weather conditions.[82] On autobahns 22 people died per 1000 injury crashes; a lower rate than the 29 deaths per 1,000 injury accidents on conventional rural roads, which in turn is five times higher than the risk on urban roads?ÿ speeds are higher on rural roads and autobahns than urban roads, increasing the severity potential of a crash.[82]\\r\\nA few countries publish the safety record of their motorways; the Federal Highway Research Institute[84] provided IRTAD statistics for the year 2012:\\r\\nFor example, a person yearly traversing 15,000 kilometres (9,300?mi) on regular roads and 10,000 kilometres (6,200?mi) on motorways has an approx. 1 in 11,000 chance of dying in a car accident on a German road in any particular year (1 in 57,000 on an autobahn), compared to 1 in 3,800 in Czech Republic, 1 in 17,000 in Denmark, or 1 in 7,200 in the United States.\\r\\nHowever, there are many differences between countries in their geography, economy, traffic growth, highway system size, degree of urbanization and motorization, and so on.\\r\\nThe Federal government does not regularly measure or estimate travel speeds.[85] One study reported in a transportation engineering journal offered historical perspective on the increase in travel speeds over a decade, as shown below.\\r\\nSource: Kellermann, G: Geschwindigkeitsverhalten im Autobahnnetz 1992. Stra?e+Autobahn,[86] Issue 5/1995.[87]\\r\\nThe Federal Environmental Office reported that, on a free-flowing section in 1992, the recorded average speed was 132?km/h (82?mph) with 51% of drivers exceeding the recommended speed.[87]\\r\\nIn 2006, speeds were recorded using automated detection loops in the State of Brandenburg at two points: on a six-lane section of A9 near Niemegk with a 130?km/h (81?mph) advisory speed limit; and on a four-lane section of A10 bypassing Berlin near Gro? Kreutz with a 120?km/h (75?mph) mandatory limit.[3] The results are shown below:\\r\\nAt peak times on the \\"free-flowing\\" section of A9, over 60% of road users exceeded the recommended 130?km/h (81?mph) maximum speed, more than 30% of motorists exceeded 150?km/h (93?mph), and more than 15% exceeded 170?km/h (106?mph)in other words the so-called \\"85th percentile speed\\" was in excess of 170?km/h.[88]\\r\\nOn 1 January 2005, a new system came into effect for mandatory tolls (Mautpflicht) on heavy trucks (those weighing more than 12 t) while using the German autobahn system (LKW-Maut). The German government contracted with a private company, Toll Collect GmbH, to operate the toll collection system, which has involved the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany. The toll is calculated depending on the toll route, as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and the number of axles on the vehicles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged ?0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007).\\r\\nDriving in Germany is regulated by the Stra?enverkehrs-Ordnung (road traffic regulations,[89] abbreviated StVO). Enforcement on the federal Autobahnen is handled by each State's Highway Patrol (Autobahnpolizei), often using unmarked police cars and motorcycles and usually equipped with video cameras,[90][91] thus allowing easier enforcement of laws such as tailgating. Notable laws include the following.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: ProStreet, Burnout 3: Takedown, and Burnout Dominator use autobahn as one of their tracks. Euro Truck Simulator 2 features the Autobahn in its open world map. Burnout 3: Takedown named them as Alpine while Burnout Dominator divided them into two (Autobahn and Autobahn Loop). Need for Speed: Porsche Unleashed also had a track that had the player drive across different sections of the autobahn. The entire game world of Crash Time: Autobahn Pursuit is set on the autobahn. On Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6, a trophy is awarded to those who have driven the same distance as the autobahn total length. In December 2010 video game developer Synetic GmbH and Conspiracy Entertainment released the title Alarm fr Cobra 11?ÿ Die Autobahnpolizei featuring real world racing and mission-based gameplay. It is taken from the popular German television series about a two-man team of Autobahnpolizei first set in Berlin then later in North Rhine-Westphalia.","input":"When did germany's 'autobahn' open for the first time?"},{"output":"October 10, 1994","context":"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[2]\\r\\nCSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of presentation and content, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.\\r\\nSeparation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.\\r\\nChanges to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.\\r\\nThe CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.\\r\\nThe CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties.\\r\\nA style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.\\r\\nIn CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.\\r\\nSelectors may apply to:\\r\\nClasses and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.\\r\\nPseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user \\"points to\\" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.[5]\\r\\nSelectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[6] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.\\r\\nThe following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.[7]\\r\\nA declaration block consists of a list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of a property, a colon (:), and a value. If there are multiple declarations in a block, a semi-colon (;) must be inserted to separate each declaration.[8]\\r\\nProperties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has a set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular groups of elements.[9]\\r\\nValues may be keywords, such as \\"center\\" or \\"inherit\\", or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the window width). Color values can be specified with keywords (e.g. \\"red\\"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0, 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000, 100%, 50%), hsla(000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).[10]\\r\\nBefore CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.\\r\\nFor example, headings (h1 elements), sub-headings (h2), sub-sub-headings (h3), etc., are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen, choice of font, size, color and emphasis for these elements is presentational.\\r\\nBefore CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.[11]\\r\\nFor example, under pre-CSS HTML, a heading element defined with red text would be written as:\\r\\nUsing CSS, the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes:\\r\\nThe advantages of this may not be immediately clear (since the second form is actually more verbose), but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:\\r\\nAll h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without any requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:\\r\\nrather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1 element.\\r\\nThe styles can also be placed in an external CSS file, as described below, and loaded using syntax similar to:\\r\\nThis further decouples the styling from the HTML document, and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing a shared external CSS file.\\r\\nCSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser, the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline, media type, importance, selector specificity, rule order, inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in a separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used; for example, the screen version can be quite different from the printed version, so that authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium.\\r\\nThe style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to a source of lower priority, such as the user agent style. This process is called cascading.\\r\\nOne of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read may apply a different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the web site, a user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers, or may remove all added styles and view the site using the browser's default styling, or may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes.\\r\\nSpecificity refers to the relative weights of various rules.[12] It determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on specification, a simple selector (e.g. H1) has a specificity of 1, class selectors have a specificity of 1,0, and ID selectors a specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system, commas are used to separate the \\"digits\\"[13] (a CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have a specificity of 11,11, not 121).\\r\\nThus the following rules selectors result in the indicated specificity:\\r\\nConsider this HTML fragment:\\r\\nIn the above example, the declaration in the style attribute overrides the one in the <style> element because it has a higher specificity.\\r\\nInheritance is a key feature in CSS; it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to a specified element, but also to its descendants.[12] Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in a page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general, descendant elements inherit text-related properties, but box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line-height, list-style, text-align, text-indent, text-transform, visibility, white-space and word-spacing. Properties that cannot be inherited are background, border, display, float and clear, height, and width, margin, min- and max-height and -width, outline, overflow, padding, position, text-decoration, vertical-align and z-index.\\r\\nInheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in a style sheet, allowing for shorter CSS.\\r\\nInheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based programming languages, where it is possible to define class B as \\"like class A, but with modifications\\".[14] With CSS, it is possible to style an element with \\"class A, but with modifications\\". However, it is not possible to define a CSS class B like that, which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications.\\r\\nGiven the following style sheet:\\r\\nSuppose there is an h1 element with an emphasizing element (em) inside:\\r\\nIf no color is assigned to the em element, the emphasized word \\"illustrate\\" inherits the color of the parent element, h1. The style sheet h1 has the color pink, hence, the em element is likewise pink.\\r\\nWhitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet:\\r\\nis functionally equivalent to this one:\\r\\nOne common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property and give it its own line.\\r\\nCSS?2.1 defines three positioning schemes:\\r\\nThere are four possible values of the position property. If an item is positioned in any way other than static, then the further properties top, bottom, left, and right are used to specify offsets and positions.\\r\\nThe float property may have one of three values. Absolutely positioned or fixed items cannot be floated. Other elements normally flow around floated items, unless they are prevented from doing so by their clear property.\\r\\nCSS was first proposed by H?kon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[17] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[18] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[19] being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[20]\\r\\nStyle sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[21] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of \\"cascading\\" styles.[21]\\r\\nAs HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations, such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb,[22] made consistent site appearance difficult, and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web.[23] Robert Cailliau, also of CERN, wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing, screen-based presentations, and editors.[22]\\r\\nImproving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list.[21] Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets[17] and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP).[20][24] Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser.[25][26][27] Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser.[20] Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).[18]\\r\\nLie's proposal was presented at the \\"Mosaic and the Web\\" conference (later called WWW2) in Chicago, Illinois in 1994, and again with Bert Bos in 1995.[18] Around this time the W3C was already being established, and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized a workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board (ERB). Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project, with additional members, including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft, participating as well. In August 1996 Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets (JSSS).[18] The spec was never finished and is deprecated.[28] By the end of 1996, CSS was ready to become official, and the CSS level 1 Recommendation was published in December.\\r\\nDevelopment of HTML, CSS, and the DOM had all been taking place in one group, the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB). Early in 1997, the ERB was split into three working groups: HTML Working group, chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C; DOM Working group, chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad; and CSS Working group, chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C.\\r\\nThe CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level 1, resulting in the creation of CSS level 2 on November 4, 1997. It was published as a W3C Recommendation on May 12, 1998. CSS level 3, which was started in 1998, is still under development as of 2014.\\r\\nIn 2005 the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS?2.1, CSS?3 Selectors and CSS?3 Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level.\\r\\nThe CSS?1 specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft's Internet Explorer 3[18] was released in that year, featuring some limited support for CSS. IE 4 and Netscape 4.x added more support, but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh, shipped in March 2000, was the first browser to have full (better than 99 percent) CSS?1 support,[29] surpassing Opera, which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support 15 months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterwards, and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS?2.\\r\\nHowever, even when later 'version 5' browsers began to offer a fairly full implementation of CSS, they were still incorrect in certain areas and were fraught with inconsistencies, bugs and other quirks. The inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve a consistent appearance across browsers and platforms, leading to the use of workarounds such as CSS hacks and filters.\\r\\nProblems with browsers' patchy adoption of CSS, along with errata in the original specification, led the W3C to revise the CSS?2 standard into CSS?2.1, which moved nearer to a working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS?2 properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped, and in a few cases, defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS?2.1 became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but CSS?2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13, 2005,[30] and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19, 2007.[31]\\r\\nIn addition to these problems, the .css extension was used by a software product used to convert PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files,[32] so some web servers served all .css[33] as mime type application/x-pointplus[34] rather than text/css.\\r\\nCSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last, typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS?1, CSS?2, CSS?3, and CSS?4. Profiles are typically a subset of one or more levels of CSS built for a particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices, printers, and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types, which were added in CSS?2.\\r\\nThe first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level 1, published on December 17, 1996. H?kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers.[35][36] Among its capabilities are support for\\r\\nThe W3C no longer maintains the CSS 1 Recommendation.[37]\\r\\nCSS level 2 specification was developed by the W3C and published as a recommendation in May 1998. A superset of CSS?1, CSS?2 includes a number of new capabilities like absolute, relative, and fixed positioning of elements and z-index, the concept of media types, support for aural style sheets (which were later replaced by the CSS 3 speech modules)[38] and bidirectional text, and new font properties such as shadows.\\r\\nThe W3C no longer maintains the CSS?2 recommendation.[39]\\r\\nCSS level 2 revision 1, often referred to as \\"CSS 2.1\\", fixes errors in CSS?2, removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications, CSS?2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became a Candidate Recommendation on February 25, 2004, but it was reverted to a Working Draft on June 13, 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However, because changes and clarifications were made, it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on 7 December 2010.\\r\\nCSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011.[40] After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee, it was finally published as a W3C Recommendation on 7 June 2011.[41]\\r\\nCSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2but low priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015.\\r\\nUnlike CSS?2, which is a large single specification defining various features, CSS?3 is divided into several separate documents called \\"modules\\". Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS?2, preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level 3 started around the time of publication of the original CSS?2 recommendation. The earliest CSS?3 drafts were published in June 1999.[42]\\r\\nDue to the modularization, different modules have different stability and statuses.[43] As of June 2012, there are over fifty CSS modules published from the CSS Working Group.,[42] and four of these have been published as formal recommendations:\\r\\nSome modules have Candidate Recommendation (CR) status and are considered moderately stable. At CR stage, implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes.[44]\\r\\nThere is no single, integrated CSS4 specification,[46] because it is split into separate modules. However, there are \\"level 4\\" modules.[47]\\r\\nBecause CSS3 split the CSS language's definition into modules, the modules have been allowed to level independently. Most modules are level 3they build on things from CSS 2.1. A few level-4 modules exist (such as Image Values,[48][49] Backgrounds & Borders,[50] or Selectors),[51] which build on the functionality of a preceding level-3 module. Other modules defining entirely new functionality, such as Flexbox, have been designated as \\"level 1\\".[52]\\r\\nThe CSS Working Group sometimes publishes Snapshots, a collection of whole modules and parts of other drafts that are considered stable, interoperably implemented and hence ready to use. So far, four such best current practices document have been published as Notes, in 2007,[53] 2010,[54] 2015.[55] and 2017.[56]\\r\\nEach web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.[57] In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems, browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments.\\r\\nIn addition to these testing tools, many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties, including CanIUse and the Mozilla Developer Network. Additionally, the CSS 3 defines feature queries, which provide an @supports directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS.[58] CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using Javascript polyfills, which are pieces of Javascript code designed to make browsers behave consistently. These workaroundsand the need to support fallback functionalitycan add complexity to development projects, and consequently, companies frequently define a list of browser versions that they will and will not support.\\r\\nAs websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older browsers, these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web (sometimes intentionally).[59] Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support, but do not work at all, in large part due to the evolution of Javascript and other web technologies.\\r\\nSome noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:\\r\\nCSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include Foundation, Blueprint, Bootstrap, Cascade Framework and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML <head>. They provide a number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published, some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping, or for learning from, and prefer to 'handcraft' CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design, maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site's styling.[73]\\r\\nAs the size of CSS resources used in a project increases, the development team needs to decide on a common methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of development, ease of collaboration during development and performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular methodologies include OOCSS - object oriented CSS, ACSS - atomic CSS, oCSS - organic Cascade Style Sheet, SMACSS - scalable and modular architecture for CSS and BEM - block, element, modifier.[74]","input":"When was css first proposed as a standard by the w3c?"},{"output":"V10 FSI","context":"The Audi R8[2] (Typ 42)[3] is a mid-engine, 2-seater sports car,[2][4] which uses Audi's trademark quattro permanent all-wheel drive system.[2][5] It was introduced by the German car manufacturer Audi AG in 2006.\\r\\nThe car is exclusively designed, developed, and manufactured by Audi AG's high performance private subsidiary company, Audi Sport GmbH (formerly quattro GmbH),[6] and is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo platform.[7] The fundamental construction of the R8 is based on the Audi Space Frame,[2] and uses an aluminium monocoque which is built using space frame principles. The car is built by quattro GmbH in a newly renovated factory at Audi's 'aluminium site' at Neckarsulm in Germany.[2]\\r\\nIn 2005, Audi announced that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car would be used for a new road car in 2007, the Audi R8, based on the Audi Le Mans quattro concept car (designed by Frank Lamberty and Julian Hoenig), appearing at the 2003 International Geneva Motor Show, and 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show. The R8 development program began in 2004, Lamberty's design being approved and frozen for production. Production body prototypes began field testing in January 2006. The R8 road car was officially launched at the Paris Auto Show on 30 September 2006. There was some confusion with the name, which the car shares with the 24 Hours of Le Mans winning R8 Le Mans Prototype (LMP). 6-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Jacky Ickx described the R8 as \\"the best handling road car today\\".[8][9][10]\\r\\nIt is also the first production car with full-LED headlamps.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Audi Le Mans quattro is a coupe with Jet Blue body colour, front curve of the front wings from Audi TT and Audi Nuvolari quattro GT, 20-inch wheels, V10 FSI engine with two turbochargers rated 610?PS (449?kW; 602?hp) and 750?N{m (553.17?lb{ft), single-frame radiator grille, aluminium sports suspension with magnetic ride shock absorbers, dark interior colours, vehicle body made of aluminium and carbon fiber, as well as the wing mirrors designed by S. Arbin, interior made of aluminium, rubber and leather.\\r\\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2003 IAA in Frankfurt.[12][13]\\r\\nTo produce the R8 at quattro GmbH, seventy workers fit 5,000 different parts by hand. The factory at Neckarsulm, redeveloped at a cost of ?28 million, usually produces between eight and fifteen cars a day, up to a maximum daily output of 29 cars.[2] Ninety-five lasers inspect the entire car in five seconds to ensure that over 220 measurements are within 0.1?millimetres of the programmed plans.[14]\\r\\nIn Asia, the R8 is available in Bahrain, Kuwait, Pakistan, India, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Philippines, Thailand, Hong Kong and Vietnam, and has been available in China, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia since 2008.\\r\\nIn Europe, the R8 is available in United Kingdom, European Union (2006ÿpresent), Russia, Turkey, Armenia (2010ÿpresent).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Audi R8 was initially equipped with a 4.2?litre V8 engine. Specifically, it is an all-aluminium alloy 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) petrol engine,[2] utilising Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI),[2] and has a displacement of 4,163 cubic centimetres (254.0?cu?in).[2] It develops a motive power output of 420 metric horsepower (309?kW; 414?bhp) (Directive 80/1269/EEC),[2] and generates 430 newton metres (317?lbf{ft) of torque,[2] on 98?RON 'Super Unleaded' petrol. It is basically the same engine used in the Audi B7 RS4, but is modified to use a dry sump lubrication system. It uses two chain-driven double overhead camshafts (DOHC) per cylinder bank, and utilises variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. The 4 wheel drive system is biased towards the rear; it sends 30% of its power to the front wheels and 70% to the rear. \\r\\nAudi AG unveiled the Audi R8 V10 on 8 December 2008.[26] It uses a 5.2?litre FSI engine,[2] based on the unit in the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 (which in turn was based on the 5.2 FSI V10 as used in the Audi C6 S6 and Audi D3 S8), but is re-tuned to produce a power output of 532 metric horsepower (391?kW; 525?bhp), and generate 530 newton metres (391?lbf{ft) of torque.[2][25] Compared to the V8 variant, the R8 V10's performance numbers are enhanced. Audi states the new 0 to 100 kilometres per hour (0.0 to 62.1?mph) time as only 3.9?seconds,[2] 60 to 124 miles per hour (97 to 200?km/h) in 8.1?seconds, and a top speed of 316 kilometres per hour (196.4?mph).[2] Other changes to the V10 version of the R8 include some aesthetic differences: such as all-LED headlights (a world-first),[2] interior enhancements such as Bang & Olufsen 465?watt sound system,[2] and a more aggressive body styling,[27] larger rear brakes and different wheels.[2] \\r\\nAlthough it was rumoured by the automotive press since the announcement of the production R8 in 2006, it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 \\"Spider\\" from filming scenes of the movie Iron Man 2 were published online. The photos showed a clearly visible \\"soft-top\\" roof, and the distinctive \\"sideblade\\" had been removed.[28] The vehicle was formally unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.[29] Compared with the coup model, the convertible had extra chassis support, a pair of roll-over safety bars, as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel filler. It was powered by the uneven firing 5.2 FSI V10 engine.[citation needed]\\r\\nGerman model launch began in first quarter of 2010, with sales started in the coming days.[30]\\r\\nUK model was sold for S111,955 OTR (manual) and S117,155 OTR (R tronic).[31] \\r\\nOn July 1, 2011 Autocar reported that Audi has made the 4.2 FSI V8 engine available on the R8 Spyder, alongside the 5.2L engine initially fitted.[citation needed] The 434?PS (319?kW; 428?bhp) (up 14?bhp on coup), 430 newton metres (317?lbf{ft) unit now completes the R8 Spyder range alongside the launch V10 powerplant. It has a 0-62?mph (0ÿ100?km/h) time of 4.8 seconds and will go on to reach a top speed of 185?mph (299?km/h). Like the V10 model, the V8 Spyder features an aluminium spaceframe with carbon composites and an automatic retractable folding cloth roof.\\r\\nThis is a concept vehicle version of the R8 Coup with 5,934?cc (5.934?L; 362.1?cu?in) V12 twin turbo Diesel engine rated 500?PS (368?kW; 493?hp) and 1,000?N{m (738?lb{ft)@1750-3000rpm with Euro 6 emissions standard compliance via oxidizing catalyst and Diesel particulate filter, matt Grace Silver body colour, 6-speed manual transmission with small-diameter double-plate clutch, quattro permanent all-wheel drive, starting ratio of 40:60.\\r\\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the Detroit Auto Show in 2008.[32]\\r\\nIt is a version of the Audi R8 V12 TDI concept with Brilliant Red body colour, rhombus-pattern cover on the air inlets and outlets, continuous aluminum spoiler lip, glass roof of the passenger compartment with two large transparent sections, glazed engine compartment behind seats, NACA duct in the middle of the roof, optional carbon fiber engine liner, LED headlights with color temperature of 6,000 kelvin, 365?mm (14.37?in) three-spoke flat bottom diecast magnesium core sport steering wheel upholstered in Valcona leather, larger aluminum applications at around the center console, 24-piston (total) brake calipers (red six-piston monobloc aluminum front calipers, fixed rear calipers), ventilated carbon fiber reinforced silicon carbide ceramic brake discs.\\r\\nThe vehicle was unveiled at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show.[33]\\r\\nThe development of the R8 TDI vehicles was cancelled, citing the cost of re-engineering the petrol R8 to accommodate the massive twin-turbocharged diesel engine is simply too great, and that it would be unable to recoup its investment through sales alone.[34]\\r\\nFor 2009, Audi announced the production of an R8 LMS racing car, designed for the GT3 rules in the FIA GT3 European Championship and various national racing series. Known within Audi Sport as the 'R16', the R8 LMS features a 500?PS (368?kW; 493?bhp) V10 engine. Because the GT3 regulations prohibit the use of four-wheel drive, Audi had to drop its 'trademark' quattro four-wheel drive system, and the R8 LMS is only available with the typical rear-wheel drive setup. The torque is transmitted via a newly developed six-speed sequential sports gearbox. The car was manufactured by Audi Sport, quattro GmbH, and Audi Hungaria Motor Kft. (Gy?r).\\r\\nThe first test races in various European racing series was scheduled for the 2009 season. Delivery to the customers was planned from the autumn of this coming year.[35] The R8 LMS GT3 was reported to cost $350,000USD.[36] European model was sold for ?262,000 (VAT included).[37]\\r\\nThe all-electric Audi e-tron concept car was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show,[38] followed by 2009 LA Auto Show (in orange body colour),[39] and at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans.[40]\\r\\nThe Audi e-tron is a version of the R8 Coup with a slightly smaller body, four electric motors rated 317?PS (233?kW; 313?bhp) and 450 newton metres (332?lbf{ft) of torque. However the proposed torque rating is the torque measured at the wheels, not at the output shaft  as is the industry standard, the true torque rating being around 678 newton metres (500?lbf{ft).[41] Other features include 42.4 kilowatt hours lithium-ion battery, needs-based energy management system, LED technology used for all lighting units, independent cooling system for each axle, doors, covers, sidewalls and roof in fiber-reinforced plastic; 3-mode flush gear selector (forward, reverse and neutral), instrument cluster with fold-out central display with integrated Audi MMI functions, climate control unit located to the right above the steering wheel, racing-inspired lightweight bucket seats, snow white and cognac interior colours, heat pump, climate control system, triangular double wishbones at the front axle and trapezoidal wishbones made of forged aluminum components at the rear axle, direct rack-and-pinion steering with speed-sensitive electromechanical steering boost, 235/35R19 front and 295/30R19 rear tires with a new blade design, prototype of an information processing system (car-to-x communication).[citation needed]\\r\\nAudi originally announced the first e-tron model to be built by quattro GmbH at Neckarsulm, with a small production series beginning in late 2012.[42] The R8 e-tron prototype was unveiled at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show.[43]\\r\\nThe prototype is based on the R8 and follows closely the original concept, with a shape reminiscent of existing V8 and V10 petrol-powered versions. Audi claims the production version of the R8 e-tron will be capable of a 0ÿ100?km/h (62?mph) time of around 4.8 seconds, making it only 0.2 seconds slower than the R8 V8. Initial plans call for its top speed to be limited to 124?mph (200?km/h) to protect the charge of the battery. It is planned for launch in early 2012. Along with the R8 e-tron, Audi is also considering small-scale production of a smaller and lighter zero-emission sportscar based on the second e-tron concept displayed at the 2010 Detroit Motor Show.\\r\\nIn 2010 Audi began a development program with the objective to manufacture a limited edition of the R8 e-tron.[44][45] On June 26, 2012, one of the earliest R8 e-tron prototypes set a new electric car lap record at the Nrburgring racetrack with a time of 8:09.099.[46]\\r\\nAfter developing 10 prototypes for research and development purposes, in May 2013 Audi decided to put on hold the production of the electric car due to its limited all-electric range as battery technology did not advance as fast as Audi had expected, making the R8 e-tron unviable for series production.[47][48]\\r\\nIn March 2014 Audi revised its decision and announced it will build the R8 e-tron upon customer request. The carmaker explained that their latest development work resulted in an increased range from 215?km (134?mi) to approximately 450?km (280?mi).[49] The limited production R8 e-tron will be based on the R8 new-generation platform shared with the Lamborghini Huracan.[50] Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2015.\\r\\nThe production version of the Audi R8 e-tron was revealed at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show[51] The limited production supercar was available only in Europe in 2015 at a price of ?1,000,000 (US$1.1 million). Fewer than 100 units were sold at the end-of-production.[52]\\r\\nThe R8 e-tron was fitted with two electric motors mounted on the rear wheels delivering 456?bhp and 678?lb ft of torque.[53] The battery pack consisted of a 92kWh T-shaped Lithium-ion battery. The e-tron could reach 0ÿ62 miles per hour (0ÿ100?km/h) in 3.9 seconds with a top speed of 155 miles per hour (249?km/h). The e-tron's delivered a driving range of 450?km (280?mi). The curb weight of the car is 1780?kg.[54][55]\\r\\nChanges to the 2009 R8 LMS include the improvement of the engine cooling system capacity, suspension revisions, race-optimised electronics and exhaust systems, and a 6-speed transmission that can be inspected through an opening in the housing without the need to dismantle the entire assembly. Previous vehicles could be upgraded via an update kit.\\r\\nThe final version of the vehicle was sold for ?298,000 (S267,000 in the UK[31]), with the first delivery going to the American-owned United Autosports team from Yorkshire in England.[56]\\r\\nIt was to be a limited production of 333 cars worldwide, 35 UK, 90 USA, this rare version of the R8 Coup 5.2 FSI quattro with curb weight reduced by 100?kg (220?lb) to 1,525?kg (3,362?lb), increased engine power to 560?PS (412?kW; 552?bhp) (367?PS (270?kW; 362?bhp) per ton). Because of these changes the R8 GT has a top speed of 199?mph (320?km/h) and goes from 0ÿ100?km/h in 3.6 seconds, 0.3 faster than the R8 V10. The car also features some visual changes including red brake caliper covers, a fixed rear wing, front bumper mounted winglets and GT badges replacing the V10 ones.\\r\\nThe vehicle was unveiled in W?rthersee Tour 2010 (in Orange).[57]\\r\\nThe vehicle was released as a 2012 model year car for $239,000 (excluding $1,250 destination charge, taxes, title, options and dealer charges).[58]\\r\\nThe \\"NF\\" (i.e. \\"Nachfolger\\" or simply \\"follower\\") prototype is a lighter weight version of the R8 with reported greater use of the lightweight carbon fiber-reinforced polymer.\\r\\nThe vehicle identified as R8 NF was featured on a timeline describing the proliferation of carbon-fiber in vehicles such as the R8 and highlighted the carbon-fiber engine cover on the R8 Spyder, the roof of the R8-based E-Tron and the various pieces found on the limited-run R8 GT, amongst others. Denoted at the 2014 mark was the NF, or more specifically, the passenger section. The prototype was reported to be up 20% (325?kg (717?lb)) lighter than an aluminum-bodied R8.\\r\\nThe photo released by Audi showed a white R8 Coup 5.2 FSI quattro, which implied that the NF would feature a new carbon-fiber rear bulkhead between the seat backs and the engine compartment and showed the carbon-fiber piece extending into the lower B-pillar. Audi would not elaborate on the image, but the car in photo was identified as a vehicle related to the NF project, but not the NF.\\r\\nThe vehicle was presented in Audi's lightweight research and production plant in Neckarsulm, Germany.[59]\\r\\nIt is a limited (333 units, 50 in USA) production vehicle that combines the improvements in the R8 GT with a convertible body. The German model went on sale for base price of ?207,800.[60]\\r\\nThe vehicle was unveiled in 2011 at Le Mans.[61]\\r\\nUS model went on sale as a 2012 Model Year vehicle, with delivery beginning in February 2012.[62]\\r\\nIt is a limited (100 units) version of the R8 Coup 4.2 FSI quattro for the UK market, commemorating the tenth victory for Audi in 24 Hours of Le Mans marathon race. It included titanium body colour option (no-cost optional metallic and pearl effect paint options, Titanium Metallic at cost), titanium finish 19-inch '5-arm double-spoke Y design' alloy wheels (from R8 GT Coupe), red brake callipers, satellite navigation, the Audi Music Interface (AMI), an interior light package, a premium Bang and Olufsen sound system, mobile phone preparation via a Bluetooth interface with integrated seat-belt microphones, Audi magnetic ride adaptive suspension system, Black Fine Nappa Leather-upholstered seats and headrests with crimson red accents and red contrast stitching, red stitching on leather-covered multi-function steering wheel and instrument cowl, crimson red leather upholstery on monoposto, knee pads and passenger door handle in red leather, floor mats have a red surround and feature the R8 logo in silver, stainless steel pedals and illuminated door sills with bright aluminium inserts carrying the R8 logo, optional Carbon Package (carbon sigma sideblades, door mirrors, monoposto, inlays and door sill trims, illuminated engine bay), bespoke R8 Driving Experience at Silverstone Circuit.\\r\\nThe vehicle was available to order from July 2011, with UK deliveries began in October.[63]\\r\\nAs part of NASCAR's embracing of GT3 in their Grand American Road Racing Association Rolex Series races, GT3 cars are permitted to run with slight restrictions as the \\"national\\" GT3 in the United States. This version (Grand-Am) features an engine with its power reduced from 470?PS (346?kW; 464?bhp) to 450?PS (331?kW; 444?bhp) via air restrictor and the engine electronics, a reduced fuel tank capacity of 83.3 litres, three-part rims for wheels and suspension, and deactivated anti-lock system and traction control (NASCAR/Grand-Am does not permit either traction control nor anti-lock brakes).[64] Additional changes include loss of aerodynamic grip via smaller front splitter and rear diffuser, stiffer roll cages, an Earnhardt bar (anti-intrusion bars on the windscreen), and side window nets on both sides, both of which are required in the Rolex Series. As is the rule, a specification Continental tyre is used.[65] Compared to the Audi R8 LMS ultra, the R8 Grand AM has lower down force.[66]\\r\\nThis model made debut in 50th Daytona 24 Hours in January 2012.\\r\\nIt is a limited (30 units) version of the R8 Coup 5.2 FSI quattro for the Chinese market.

Huscar initiated the war because he saw himself as the rightful heir to the kingdom of all the Incas. Regardless of legitimacy, Atahualpa proved himself to be tactically superior to his brother in warcraft and to the mighty armies of Cuzco, which their father had stationed in the north part of the empire during the military campaign.[3] Accounts from sources all vary in the exact details.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1524-1526, the Spaniards under the command of Francisco Pizarro, explored South America.[4] There were 62 horsemen and 106 foot soldiers.[5] Smallpox was taken to the continent, causing disaster for the Incas. Sapa Inca Huayna Capac travelled north to investigate the strangers. Although he never met any Spaniards, he contracted smallpox and died in 1524. His eldest son and heir, Ninan Cuyochi, died soon after him.[6] Thus, it became uncertain as to who should be the next Inca king. There were no clear rules of succession.[7] The choice stood between two sons of Huayna Capac, Huscar, and Atahualpa, born of different mothers.\\r\\nWayna Qhapaq was king before the dynastic war began; his, along with his sons death (most likely due to smallpox), created the circumstances for a non-appointed king [8]\\r\\nHuscar was appointed king by Huayna Capac,[9] and was supported by the nobility in Cuzco, by religious and political authorities and other main figures. He was the eldest \\"pure\\" Inca, because his parents, Huayna Capac and Chincha Ocllo, were siblings.[10] Huascar was ill-tempered, suspicious and disrespectful of the laws and customs.\\r\\nAtahualpa's mother, Paccha, was born outside the royal family (although born into the Shyri royal family) and was merely the daughter of Cacha Shyri Duchicela, the former leader against the Incan conquest in the north.[11] He was much liked in the North, as he was good tempered and carried himself with royal dignity. He allegedly had cunning and early wisdom.\\r\\nNobles considered Atahualpa illegitimate and Huscar felt it an insult that a \\"bastard\\" was even considered for Sapa Inca.[12]\\r\\nHuscar eventually became king,[13] but he felt that Atahualpa should not have any more land and that he should pay homage to him.[14]\\r\\nSoon after Huascar claimed the throne, he expected all subjects to swear him allegiance. To announce his loyalty, Atahualpa sent his most trusted captains to Cuzco, along with generous gifts of gold and silver (as was customary). Suspicious, Huascar refused Atahualpa's offering.[15] Accusing him of rebellion, he ordered some of his messengers killed, and sent back his captains dressed as women. Atahualpa declared war against his brother. Just before the Spaniards arrived in Cajamarca, Atahualpa had sent troops to Cusco to capture Huscar, and later on his way to the North to kill him. (Later Francisco Pizarro used this as one of excuses to execute Atahualpa after Pizarro collected the ransom of gold and silver promised to him for his freedom.)\\r\\nHuscar gathered his soldiers in preparation for attack. After getting stunned by his brother, Huascar proclaimed him a traitor.[16] The generals Chalcuchimac, Quizquiz, and Rumi?awi, were thought to have been born in the northern part of the empire, and thus transferred their loyalty to Atahualpa[17] who assembled the former imperial army in Quito, the Northern region left for his control. People loyal to Atahualpa created a new capital in Quito, so they could follow their preferred ruler and gain favor within the government. Atahualpa agreed to take the leadership role of Sapa Inca in this new capital.\\r\\nAt this news, Huscar and his army moved north[18] in a surprise attack at Tumebamba. The local Ca?ari supported the attack, in order to expel the nearest source of power, with the aim oust the Inca. Atahualpa was captured and imprisoned. While the army celebrated, they got drunk and allowed a woman in to meet Atahualpa. She snuck in a tool that he used that evening to drill a hole and escape.[19] He immediately prepared a counterattack with his large, experienced army from Quito.[20]\\r\\nFrom 1531 through 1532, the armies fought many battles.[21] Soon after his escape, Atahualpa moved his army south to the city of Ambato.[22] There, on the plains of Mochacaxa, they found Huscar's men, defeated them,[23] and captured and killed many soldiers and even the head general, Atoc whom they tortured with darts and arrows.[24] Atahualpa had his skull made into a \\"gilded drinking cup, which the Spaniards would note that Atahualpa was still using four years later.[25]\\r\\nFollowing this victory, Atahualpa strengthened his army and continued south into his brother's land, winning every encounter. Entering Cajamarca, he added to his numbers. He first tried peaceful means to gain loyalty from Huscars men; where that did not work, he became extremely violent, murdering large numbers. This scared the survivors into surrender. One report described how Atahualpa massacred the Ca?ari tribesmen because they pledged allegiance to Huscar.[26] When he finally arrived in Cajamarca, Atahualpa sent the majority of his army ahead, led by his head generals, while he stayed in the safety of the city and explored rumors that the Spaniards were entering the land.[27]\\r\\nAtahualpa's army pushed south through Huscars territory, winning at Bonbon and Jauja. The battle starting on the hillside of Vilcas seemed to favor Huscar stationed in a stone fortress at the top of the hill, but eventually he retreated. Atahualpa's men won at Pincos, Andaguayias, at the battle between Curaguaci and Auancay northwest of Cuzco, at Limatambo, about 20 miles from Cuzco, and Ichubamba, where Huscars men fled.[28] In 1532, with Cuzco endangered, Huscar sent another army to meet Atahualpas, but after precarious battles, his forces were routed\\" and Huscar was captured.[29] Atahualpas army had won the war. The news traveled back to Atahualpa in Cajamarca, where the army then learned about the Spanish incursion.\\r\\nAtahualpa was saluted as a hero; when recapturing Cajamarca, making camp outside the city with some 40,000 troops[30] while Chalcuchimac and Quizquiz chased Huscars army south. With a disastrous northern campaign, Huscar had not only lost his best generals and many soldiers, but his army was shocked and demoralized. Huascar and Atahualpas armies met. Huscar, after finding himself in a dominant position, refused to make use of it, opting for a safe retreat, crossing the Cotabambas River on the way to Cuzco.\\r\\nChalkuchimac had a plan of his own and predicted the action of Topa Atao, and divided his army in two, sending one contingent around Topa Atao's back, enveloping and destroying the defenders. In January 1532, only miles from Cuzco, Huscars retreat was cut off at Quipaipan, and his army was annihilated and disbanded.[31] Huscar was captured and the capital Cuzco was seized by Quizquiz, who had it purged from Huscars supporters in a bloody massacre. Huscar himself was executed the following year.[32][33]\\r\\nDuring the course of the war, Atahualpa's army had grown to 250,000 men, all the strength of the Empire. However, before he could leave Cajamarca, the new king encountered conquistador Francisco Pizarro, who had reached the city on 16 November, and Atahualpa was captured in the ensuing Battle of Cajamarca.[34]\\r\\nIn the custody of Pizarro, Atahualpa was told by Pizarro that he would bring Huscar to Cajamarca and Pizarro would judge which brother was the better Sapa Inca. In response, Atahualpa ordered Huscar killed allegedly by drowning.[35] Only months later on August 29, 1533, Atahualpa was himself garroted at the plaza of Cajamarca by Pizarros men.[36]\\r\\nIt is unknown how many Inca were killed or died during the Civil War. The estimated population of the Inca empire before an epidemic (probably of a European disease) and the Spanish conquest is estimated at between 6 and 14 million people.[37] The civil war, an epidemic, probably of a European disease, and the Spanish conquest resulted in a population decline over several decades estimated as 20:1 or 25:1, meaning that the population declined by 95 percent.[38]\\r\\nOf the major battles fought, at Cajamarca the Spanish ambushed the Andean warriors and killed 1,500 without suffering any losses.[39] There are no other hard numbers of Inca or Spanish death tolls at any of the other battles. Spanish and European disease caused widespread indigenous deaths across Latin America. Smallpox was the first recorded epidemic in December 1518; on Columbus second voyage, an influenza outbreak is believed to have killed large numbers, including Spanish. \\"Of the 1500 men who sailed from Cdiz on September 25, 1493, scarcely 200 were alive a decade later.\\"[40]","input":"What brothers fought for control of the inca empire?"},{"output":"Rebecca Maddern","context":"Australian Ninja Warrior is a sports entertainment competition spin-off of the Japanese television series Sasuke which premiered on 9 July 2017 on the Nine Network.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was announced in 2016 with applications open until 9 September 2016, with filming between November & December 2016 on Cockatoo Island.[2] The series was officially confirmed at Nine's upfronts in November 2016 with Rebecca Maddern announced as host.[3][4] A few days after the announcement, Ben Fordham was announced as second host & Freddie Flintoff as the series' sideline reporter.[5] The series began airing on 9 July 2017.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was renewed for a second season during the season one final which was filmed between December 2017 & January 2018, with applications that closed by 3 September 2017.[6][7] On 11 October 2017, the series was officially confirmed for renewal at Nines upfronts, also confirming Fordham, Maddern & Flintoff returning for the second season.[8] The second season began airing on 8 July 2018.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential contestants go through a rigorous series of obstacles before the possibility of becoming the next Australian Ninja Warrior and win a cash prize, starting at $100,000.

Designed by architect B. Marcus Priteca, it was the last theater built by the vaudeville impresario Alexander Pantages. The palatial Art Deco theater opened on June 4, 1930, as part of the Pantages Theatre Circuit.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pantages Theatre Circuit had been built on vaudeville, and the new Hollywood theater programmed first-run movies alternating through the day with vaudeville acts for its first two years. But like other theaters during the Great Depression, it was forced to economize and thereafter operated primarily as a movie theater, though live entertainment was presented occasionally.\\r\\nAlexander Pantages sold the Hollywood landmark in 1932 to Fox West Coast Theaters. In 1949, Howard Hughes acquired the Hollywood Pantages for his RKO Theatre Circuit and moved his personal offices to the building's second floor. From 1949 through 1959, the theatre hosted the American motion picture industry's annual Academy Award Ceremonies.[2] It continued to be a major venue for roadshow movies into the 1970s. From 1965, it was operated by Pacific Theatres. The Hollywood Pantages closed as a movie theater in January, 1977, and re-opened the following month with Bubbling Brown Sugar, the first of the many stage productions that have since become its regular fare.\\r\\nNow operated by an arm of the Nederlander Organization, the Hollywood Pantages is one of Los Angeles' leading venues for live theater (the five highest-grossing weeks in L.A.'s theatrical history were all shows at the Hollywood Pantages). The theatre has recently presented large-scale Broadway musicals such as Disney's The Lion King, which ran at the theatre for over two years, and hosted the long-running Los Angeles production of the Broadway musical Wicked.\\r\\nSituated on a prime location, the area's building and a rejuvenation boom has spread to Bob Hope Square with the addition of a new W Hotel and retail stores, tied closely to the Hollywood/Vine station. The theater underwent a $10-million restoration and upgrade in 2000. The original plans for the Hollywood Pantages were for a 12-story building: 2 floors dedicated to theater and 10 floors of office space. Completion of the 10 upper floors was halted due to the 1929 stock market crash during construction. In December 2007, plans were revealed to complete the original design and additional stories, but it was never realized.[2]\\r\\nThe theatre has also occasionally hosted popular music concerts, including those of the bands Dream Theater, Foo Fighters and Mark Knopfler (of Dire Straits). Talking Heads' 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense was shot there. In 1997, 4 years before her English crossover, Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira performed her first show in the United States at the Hollywood Pantages. In 2006, Mexican pop-group RBD recorded their CD/DVD \\"Live in Hollywood\\" at the Hollywood Pantages.\\r\\nThe Hollywood Pantages Theatre is also a popular location for the filming of movies, TV shows, and music videos. Concert scenes in the 1980 film The Jazz Singer and in Michael Jackson's 1995 video \\"You Are Not Alone\\" are just two examples out of many.

Biltmore House, the main residence, is a Chateauesque-style mansion built by George Washington Vanderbilt II between 1889 and 1895 and is the largest privately owned house in the United States, at 178,926 square feet (16,622.8?m2)[2] of floor space (135,280 square feet (12,568?m2) of living area). Still owned by George Vanderbilt's descendants, it stands today as one of the most prominent remaining examples of the Gilded Age.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1880s, at the height of the Gilded Age, George Washington Vanderbilt II, youngest son of William Henry Vanderbilt, began to make regular visits with his mother, Maria Louisa Kissam Vanderbilt (1821ÿ1896), to the Asheville, North Carolina, area. He loved the scenery and climate so much that he decided to create his own summer estate in the area, which he called his \\"little mountain escape\\", just as his older brothers and sisters had built opulent summer houses in places such as Newport, Rhode Island, and Hyde Park, New York. Vanderbilt named his estate Biltmore derived from \\"Bildt,\\" Vanderbilt's ancestors' place of origin in Holland, and \\"More\\", Anglo-Saxon for open, rolling land.[3] A portion of the estate was once the African-American community of Shiloh.[4] Vanderbilt bought almost 700 parcels of land, including over 50 farms and at least five cemeteries. A spokesperson for the estate said in 2017 that archives show much of the land \\"was in very poor condition, and many of the farmers and other landowners were glad to sell.\\"[5]\\r\\nConstruction of the house began in 1889 and continued well into 1896. In order to facilitate such a large project, a woodworking factory and brick kiln, which produced 32,000 bricks a day, were built onsite, and a three-mile railroad spur was constructed to bring materials to the building site. Construction on the main house required the labor of well over 1,000 workers and 60 stonemasons.[6] Vanderbilt went on extensive buying trips overseas as construction on the house was in progress. He returned to North Carolina with thousands of furnishings for his newly built home including tapestries, hundreds of carpets, prints, linens, and decorative objects, all dating between the 15th century and the late 19th century. Among the few American-made items were the more practical oak drop-front desk, rocking chairs, a walnut grand piano, bronze candlesticks and a wicker wastebasket.[7]\\r\\nGeorge Vanderbilt opened his opulent estate on Christmas Eve 1895 to invited family and friends from across the country, who were encouraged to enjoy leisure and country pursuits. Notable guests to the estate over the years included author Edith Wharton, novelist Henry James, ambassadors Joseph Hodges Choate and Larz Anderson, and Presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson. George married Edith Stuyvesant Dresser in 1898 in Paris, France; their only child, Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt, was born at Biltmore in the Louis XV room in 1900, and grew up at the estate.\\r\\nDriven by the impact of the newly imposed income taxes, and the fact that the estate was getting harder to manage economically, Vanderbilt initiated the sale of 87,000 acres (352?km2) to the federal government. After Vanderbilt's unexpected death in 1914 of complications from an emergency appendectomy, his widow completed the sale to carry out her husband's wish that the land remain unaltered, and that property became the nucleus of the Pisgah National Forest.[6] Overwhelmed with running such a large estate, Edith began consolidating her interests and sold Biltmore Estate Industries in 1917 and Biltmore Village in 1921. Edith intermittently occupied the house, living in an apartment carved out of the former Bachelors' Wing, until the marriage of her daughter to John Francis Amherst Cecil in April 1924. The Cecils went on to have two sons who were born in the same room as their mother.\\r\\nIn an attempt to bolster the estate's financial situation during the Great Depression, Cornelia and her husband opened Biltmore to the public in March 1930 at the request of the City of Asheville, which hoped the attraction would revitalize the area with tourism.[8] Biltmore closed during World War II and in 1942, 62 paintings and 17 sculptures were moved to the estate by train from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. to protect them in the event of an attack on the United States. The Music Room on the first floor was never finished, so it was used for storage until 1944, when the possibility of an attack became more remote. Among the works stored were the Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington and works by Rembrandt, Raphael, and Anthony van Dyck. David Finley, the gallery director, was a friend of Edith Vanderbilt and had stayed at the estate.[9]\\r\\nAfter the divorce of the Cecils in 1934, Cornelia left the estate never to return; however, John Cecil maintained his residence in the Bachelors' Wing until his death in 1954. Their eldest son George Henry Vanderbilt Cecil, occupied rooms in the wing until 1956. At this point Biltmore House ceased to be a family residence and has continued to be operated as a historic house museum.\\r\\nYounger son William A. V. Cecil, Sr. returned to the estate in 1960 and joined his brother to manage the estate and make it a profitable and self-sustaining enterprise like his grandfather envisioned. He eventually inherited the estate upon the death of his mother, Cornelia, in 1976, while his brother, George, inherited the then more profitable dairy farm which was split off into Biltmore Farms. In 1995, while celebrating the 100th anniversary of the estate, Cecil turned over control of the company to his son, William A.V. Cecil, Jr. The Biltmore Company is privately held and of the 4,306.86 acres that make up Biltmore Estate, only 1.36 acres are in the city limits of Asheville, and the Biltmore House is not part of any municipality.[10]\\r\\nThe estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963,[11] and remains a major tourist attraction in Western North Carolina with over 1 million visitors each year.[12]\\r\\nVanderbilt commissioned prominent New York architect Richard Morris Hunt, who had previously designed houses for various Vanderbilt family members, to design the house in the Chateauesque style, using French Renaissance chateaus that Vanderbilt and Hunt had visited in early 1889, including Chateau de Blois, Chenonceau and Chambord in France and Waddesdon Manor in England, as inspiration with their steeply pitched roofs, turrets and sculptural ornamentation.[13] Hunt sited the four-story Indiana limestone-built home to face east with a 375-foot facade to fit into the mountainous topography behind. The facade is asymmetrically balanced with two projecting wings connecting to the entrance tower with an open loggia to the left side and a windowed arcade to the right which held the Winter Garden that was fashionable during the Victorian era. The entrance tower contains a series of windows with decorated jambs that extend from the front door to the most decorated dormer at Biltmore on the fourth floor. The carved decorations include trefoils, flowing tracery, rosettes, gargoyles, and at prominent lookouts, grotesques. The staircase is one of the more prominent features of the east facade, with its three-story, highly decorated winding balustrade with carved statues of St. Louis and Joan of Arc by the Austrian-born architectural sculptor Karl Bitter.\\r\\nThe south facade has the smallest dimensions for the house and is dominated by three large dormers on the east side and a polygonal turret on the west side. An arbor is attached to the house and is accessed from the library which is located on the ground floor. On the north end of the house, Hunt placed the attached stables, carriage house and its courtyard to protect the house and gardens from the wind. The 12,000-square-foot complex housed Vanderbilt's prized driving horses and the carriage house opposite the stables stored his 20 carriages in addition to any of his guest's carriages.\\r\\nThe rear western elevation is less elaborate than the front facade, with some windows not having any decoration at all. Two matching polygonal towers in the center are connected to the polygonal south turret by an open loggia that opens the main rooms of the house to the views of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the distance. The loggia is decorated overhead with terracotta tiles set in a herringbone pattern. The self-supporting ceramic tile vault and arch system was used extensively inside and outside of Biltmore, and was patented by Rafael Guastavino, a Spanish architect and engineer, who personally supervised the installation. The limestone columns were carved to reflect the sunlight in aesthetically pleasing and varied ways per Vanderbilt's wish. The rusticated base is a contrast to the smooth limestone used on the remainder of the house.\\r\\nThe steeply pitched roof is punctuated by 16 chimneys and covered with slate tiles that were affixed one by one. Each tile was drilled at the corners and wired onto the attics steel infrastructure. Copper flashing was then installed at the junctions to prevent water from penetrating. The fanciful flashing on the ridge of the roof was embossed with George Vanderbilts initials and motifs from his family crest, though the original gold leaf no longer survives.[14]\\r\\nBiltmore House had electricity from the time it was built. With electricity less safe and fire more of a danger at the time, the house had six separate sections divided by brick fire walls.[15]\\r\\nVanderbilt paid little attention to the family business or his own investments, and it is believed that the construction and upkeep of Biltmore depleted much of his inheritance.[citation needed]\\r\\nBiltmore has four acres of floor space and a total of 250 rooms in the house including 35 bedrooms for family and guests, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens and 19th-century novelties such as electric elevators, forced-air heating, centrally controlled clocks, fire alarms, and a call-bell system.[13] The principal rooms of the house are located on the ground floor. To the right of the marbled Entrance Hall, the octagonal, sunken Winter Garden is surrounded by stone archways with a ceiling of architecturally sculptured wood and multifaceted glass. The centerpiece is a marble and bronze fountain sculpture titled Boy Stealing Geese created by Karl Bitter. On the walls just outside the Winter Garden are copies of the Parthenon frieze. The Banquet Hall is the largest room in the house, measuring 42 feet wide and 72 feet long, with a 70-foot-high barrel-vaulted ceiling. The table could seat 64 guests surrounded by rare Flemish tapestries and a triple fireplace that spans one end of the hall. On the opposite end of the hall is an organ gallery that houses a 1916 Skinner pipe organ. Left unfinished with bare brick walls, the Music Room was not completed and opened to the public until 1976. It showcases a mantel designed by Hunt, and a large engraving by Albrecht Drer called the Triumphal Arch commissioned by Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I. The mantle had been stored in the stable for over 80 years. To the left of the entrance hall is the 90-foot-long Tapestry Gallery, which leads to the Library, featuring three 16th-century tapestries representing The Triumph of Virtue Over Vice. Elsewhere on the walls are family portraits by John Singer Sargent, Giovanni Boldini and James Whistler. The two-story Library contains over 10,000 volumes in eight languages, reflecting George Vanderbilt's broad interests in classic literature as well as works on art, history, architecture, and gardening. The second-floor balcony is accessed by an ornate walnut spiral staircase. The baroque detailing of the room is enhanced by the rich walnut paneling and the ceiling painting, The Chariot of Aurora, brought to Biltmore by Vanderbilt from the Palazzo Pisani Moretta in Venice, Italy. The painting by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini is the most important work by the artist still in existence.[16]\\r\\nThe second floor is accessed by the cantilevered Grand Staircase of 102 steps spiraling around a four-story, wrought-iron chandelier holding 72 light bulbs.[17] The Second Floor Living Hall is an extension of the grand staircase as a formal hall and portrait gallery, and was restored to its original configuration in 2013. Several large-scale masterpieces are displayed in the hall, including two John Singer Sargent portraits of Biltmore's architect, Richard Morris Hunt, and landscaper, Frederick Law Olmsted, both commissioned for the home by Vanderbilt.[18] Located nearby in the south tower is George Vanderbilt's gilded bedroom with furniture designed by Hunt. His bedroom connects to his wife's Louis XV-style, oval-shaped bedroom in the north tower through a Jacobean carved oak paneled sitting room with an intricate ceiling.\\r\\nThe suite of rooms includes the Damask Room; the Claude Room, named after one of Vanderbilt's favorite artists, Claude Lorrain; the Tyrolean Chimney Room; and the most grand, the Louis XV Room, so named due to its architectural scheme and furnishings that were very popular in the late nineteenth century. The suite was restored and opened to the public for the first time in 100 years in 2011.[19]\\r\\nThe third floor has a number of guest rooms with names that describe the furnishing or artist that they were decorated with. The fourth floor has 21 bedrooms that were inhabited by housemaids, laundresses, and other female servants. Also included on the fourth floor is an Observatory with a circular staircase that leads to a wrought iron balcony with doorways to the rooftop where Vanderbilt could view his estate. Male servants were not housed here, however, but instead resided in rooms above the stable and complex.[13]\\r\\nThe Billiard Room is decorated with an ornamental plaster ceiling and rich oak paneling and was equipped with both a custom-made pool table and a carom table (table without pockets). The room was mainly frequented by men, but ladies were welcome to enter as well. Secret door panels on either side of the fireplace lead to the private quarters of the Bachelors Wing where female guests and staff members were not allowed. The wing includes the Smoking Room, which was fashionable for country houses, and the Gun Room, which held mounted trophies and displayed George Vanderbilts gun collection.[13]\\r\\nGuests of the estate could enjoy other activities that were found on the basement level, including an indoor 70,000-gallon (265,000-litre and 265-cubic meter) heated swimming pool with underwater lighting, one of the nation's first bowling alleys installed in a private residence, and a gymnasium with once state-of-the-art fitness equipment. The service hub of the house is also found in the largest basement in the US, as the location for the main kitchen, pastry kitchen, rotisserie kitchen, walk-in refrigerators that provided an early form of mechanical refrigeration, the servants' dining hall, laundry rooms and additional bedrooms for staff.\\r\\nWanting the best, Vanderbilt envisioned a park-like setting for his home and employed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to design the grounds. However, Olmsted was not impressed with the condition of the 125,000 acres (195?sq?mi; 510?km2) and advised for a park surrounding the house, establishing farms along the river and replanting the rest as a commercial timber forest, a plan to which Vanderbilt agreed. Gifford Pinchot and later Carl A. Schenck were hired to manage the forests, with Schenck establishing the first forestry education program in the U.S., the Biltmore Forest School, on the estate grounds in 1898.\\r\\nAnother important aspect of the landscaping was the intentionally rustic three-mile (5?km) Approach Road that began at the brick quoined and pebbledash stucco Lodge Gate at the edge of Biltmore Village, and ended at the sphinx-topped stone pillars at the Esplanade. In between, the lane was densely filled with natural and uncultivated looking foliage and shrubbery to provide a relaxing journey for guests. Olmsted made sure to incorporate 75 acres (30?ha) of formal gardens that had been requested by Vanderbilt for the grounds directly surrounding the house. He constructed an Italian formal garden, a walled garden, a shrub and rose garden, fountains, and a conservatory with individual rooms for palms and orchids. There was also a bowling green, an outdoor tea room, and a terrace to incorporate the European statuary that Vanderbilt had brought back from his travels. At the opposite end of the Esplanade is the Rampe Douce, a graduated stairway zigzagging along a rough-cut limestone wall that leads to the grassy slope known as the Vista, topped with a statue of Diana, the goddess of the hunt.[13]\\r\\nWater features were an important aspect of Victorian landscaping and Olmsted incorporated two for the estate: the Bass Pond created from an old creek-fed millpond and the Lagoon. Each was used for guest recreation like fishing and rowing. To supply water for the estate, Olmsted engineered two reservoirs. One was a spring-fed man-made lake on nearby Busbee Mountain. The other was a man-made, brick-lined reservoir, located behind the statue of Diana in the Vista, at an elevation of approximately 266 feet above the Esplanade.[20]\\r\\nVanderbilt's idea was to replicate the working estates of Europe. He asked Hunt and Olmsted to design a village with architecturally compatible buildings and picturesque landscaping as a source of income through building rental, a place to help carry out philanthropic programs, and an easy point of access between the estate and the train station.[21] The result was Biltmore Village. The village included rental cottages complete with plumbing and central heating, a post office, shops, doctor's office, school, and a church, known today as the Cathedral of All Souls.[22] Intending that the estate could be self-supporting, Vanderbilt set up scientific forestry programs, poultry farms, cattle farms, hog farms, and a dairy. His wife, Edith, also enthusiastically supported agricultural reform and promoted the establishment of a state agricultural fair. In 1901, the Vanderbilts provided financial assistance to Biltmore Industries, started by Biltmore Village resident Eleanor Vance, which taught young people how to make hand-carved furniture, woven baskets, homespun wool fabric, and more.[23]\\r\\nThe estate today covers approximately 8,000 acres (13?sq?mi; 32?km2) and is split in half by the French Broad River, overseen by The Biltmore Company, a trust set up by the family. The company is a large enterprise that is one of the largest employers in the Asheville area. Restaurants were opened in 1979 and 1987 as well as four gifts shops in 1993. The former dairy barn was converted into the popular Biltmore Winery in 1985. The AAA four-diamond 210-room Inn on Biltmore Estate opened in 2001, and in 2010, the estate debuted Antler Hill Village, as well as a remodeled winery, and connected farmyard.\\r\\nThe Biltmore Estate licenses its name and design elements to a line of housewares, linens, and luggage called \\"Biltmore For Your Home\\", marketed exclusively by Belk stores.[24]\\r\\nThe house has been featured in \\"Empires of the Smoky Skies\\", a scenario in Sid Meier's Civilization V. The estate and its surrounding forest make up the setting of Robert Beatty's 2015 middle-grade novel Serafina and the Black Cloak and its 2016 sequel Serafina and the Twisted Staff.[25]\\r\\nThe grounds and buildings of Biltmore Estate have appeared in a number of major motion pictures and TV series:","input":"When did the biltmore house open to the public?"},{"output":"About 75","context":"This is the list of bats of Australia,[1][2][3] a sub-list of the list of mammals of Australia.

A total of 198 riders from 22 teams entered the 21-stage race, which was won by Chris Froome of Team Sky, his fourth overall victory.

Six countries had more than 10 riders in the race: France (39), Italy (18), Belgium (16), Germany (16), the Netherlands (15), and Spain (13).[7] The average age of riders in the race was 29.4 years,[10] ranging from the 22-year-old lie Gesbert (FortuneoÿOscaro) to the 40-year-old Haimar Zubeldia (TrekÿSegafredo).[11][12] CannondaleÿDrapac had the youngest average age while Team Dimension Data had the oldest.[13]\\r\\nUCI WorldTeams\\r\\nUCI Professional Continental teams\\r\\nIn the lead up to the 2017 Tour de France, Chris Froome (Team Sky) was seen by many as the top pre-race favourite for the general classification.[14][15][16][17][18][excessive citations] His closest rivals were thought to be Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Nairo Quintana (Movistar Team), Alberto Contador (TrekÿSegafredo), Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale) and Fabio Aru (Astana).[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][excessive citations] The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Alejandro Valverde (Movistar Team), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana), Thibaut Pinot (FDJ), Esteban Chaves (OricaÿScott), Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Dan Martin (Quick-Step Floors), Simon Yates (OricaÿScott), and Louis Meintjes (UAE Team Emirates).[17][17][20][21][22][excessive citations]\\r\\nFroome, who won the 2013, 2015 and 2016 editions of the Tour, had not won a race in the 2017 season prior to the Tour's start. His best result was fourth overall at the Critrium du Dauphin, a race considered to be the warm-up for the Tour and one he has won before his three previous Tour victories. Despite this, he was thought to have one of the strongest teams in the race that would ride in total support of him.[16][18] The 32-year-old Porte, who placed fifth in the 2016 Tour, won the general classification in two stage races so far in 2017, the Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie, and came second in the Dauphin.[18] Quintana, third in the 2016 Tour, placed second at the Giro d'Italia, with overalls wins at the TirrenoÿAdriatico and the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana earlier in the season.[21] The two-time winner (2007 and 2009) 34-year-old Contador came second overall in four stage races in 2017 before the Tour, ParisÿNice, the Vuelta a Andaluca, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of the Basque Country.[21] Bardet, the 2017 Tour runner-up, placed sixth overall in the Dauphin, with his best other result sixth in the one-day Classic race LigeÿBastogneÿLige.[18] Aru started the Tour sharing team leadership with the Dauphin winner Fuglsang.

In September 2015, a week before this was due to be announced, Transport for London pulled out of the bid.[33] It was later revealed that this was the decision of the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on the grounds of cost: hosting the Grand Depart would have cost S35 million.[34] In December 2015, the ASO announced that the Grand Dpart would take place with stages based in Dsseldorf; the fourth time the Tour has begun in Germany and the first since 1987. The bid to host the Tour was only narrowly approved by the city council. The return to Germany followed a resurgence in German professional cycling.[35] On 14 January 2016, details of the opening two stages were announced. The first stage would be a 13-kilometre (8.1?mi) individual time trial in Dsseldorf itself. The second stage would also begin in Dsseldorf.[36] The full route was announced by race director Christian Prudhomme on 18 October 2016 at the Palais des Congrs in Paris.[37]\\r\\nAfter the first time trial, the race left Germany during stage two, which finished in the Belgian city of Lige.[38] Stage three headed south, and after a brief passage through Luxembourg, ended with a climb in Longwy.[39] After a transitional stage, stage five saw the first major climb, the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles.[38] The next two stages headed south-west,[38] before stage eight in the Jura Mountains, featured three categorised climbs.[40] The ninth stage included the steep climbs of the Col de la Biche?(fr), the Col du Grand Colombier, and, after a 42-year absence, the Signal du Mont du Chat, its summit 25?km (15.5?mi) from the finish in Chambry.[41][42] After a transfer during the rest day, stage ten took place in the Dordogne region, between Prigueux and Bergerac. Stage eleven was a transitional stage, followed by two stages in the Pyrenees. Stage twelve started from Pau and ended at the Peyragudes ski resort.[38] The next stage was short, at 110?km (68?mi), but included three climbs before a descent finish into Foix.[43] After leaving the Pyrenees, the riders headed north-east; stage fourteen finished with a climb towards the end of the stage.[44] Stage fifteen featured the first appearance of the Col de Peyra Taillade, with its conclusion in Le Puy-en-Velay.[45] Stage sixteen, the first after the final rest day, was a transitional stage, heading east, towards the Alps.[38] Stage seventeen included the Col d'Ornon, the Col de la Croix de Fer, the Col du Tlgraphe and the highest point of elevation in the race, the Col du Galibier, before a descent finish into Serre Chevalier.[46] Stage eighteen was the final day of mountains; it had two climbs, the Col de Vars and the finishing climb, the Col d'Izoard.[47] It was the first time the Tour finished on the 2,360?m (7,743?ft)-high mountain pass.[48] After another transitional stage, heading south, came stage twenty, a 23?km (14.3?mi) individual time trial in Marseille.[38] Starting at the Stade Vlodrome, the course headed around the city, designated 2017 European Capital of Sport, before ending also at the Stade Vlodrome.[49] The final stage started in Montgeron, which hosted the start of the first Tour, before concluding with the traditional laps of the Champs-lyses.[37][38]\\r\\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of 3,540?km (2,200?mi), 13?km (8.1?mi) shorter than the 2016 Tour.[38][50] There were two time trial events, both of which were individual, a total of 36?km (22.4?mi).[38] Of the remaining nineteen stages, eight were officially classified as flat, six as medium mountain and five as high mountain.[51][38] The longest mass-start stage was stage 19, at 222.5?km (138?mi), and the shortest was stage 13, at 101?km (63?mi).[38] For the first time since the 1992 edition, the route included all five of mainland France's mountainous regions; the Vosges, the Jura, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central and the Alps.[52][53] There were summit finishes on stage 12 to Peyragudes and stage 18 to the Col d'Izoard. Additionally, the hilly stage 3 had a hilltop finish in Longwy, and stage 5 ended at La Planche des Belles Filles.[54] There were seven hors catgorie (English: \\"out of category\\") rated climbs in the race.[54] The Tour included ten new start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, in the Dordogne, and 15, in Le Puy-en-Velay.[38]\\r\\nThe opening stage's individual time trial was won by Geraint Thomas with a time of 16 min 4 s over the 14?km (8.7?mi) course. Thomas took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Chris Froome was the highest placed of the general classification favourites, in sixth place, sixteen seconds down.[57] Overall contender Alejandro Valverde crashed on the wet roads and his injuries forced him to withdraw from the Tour.[58] Marcel Kittel won stage two's bunch sprint, and with it the green jersey. Breakaway rider Taylor Phinney (CannondaleÿDrapac) took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.[59] The uphill sprint finish of stage three was won by Peter Sagan; Nathan Brown (CannondaleÿDrapac) took over the polka dot jersey.[60] The fourth stage ended with a bunch sprint and was won by Arnaud Dmare (FDJ), with him also taking the green jersey.[61] There were two crashes leading up to the finish, the first was in the peloton around 1?km (0.6?mi) to go and the second involved the sprinters at the end. In the sprint finish, Mark Cavendish crashed into the barriers at the side of the road, withdrawing later that day from the race from his injuries. Sagan, second in the stage, was disqualified after race officials judged that he caused Cavendish to crash, with the jury president Philippe Marien saying that he \\"endangered some of his colleagues seriously\\".[62][63]\\r\\nIn the fifth stage, a group containing the overall contenders caught the last of the breakaway riders 5?km (3.1?mi) from the summit finish at La Planche des Belles Filles. With 2.4?km (1.5?mi) remaining, Fabio Aru attacked and won with a margin of sixteen seconds over the group. Thomas lost twenty seconds on the group and lost the yellow jersey to teammate Froome. Aru took over the lead of the mountains classification.[64] Kittel won the following two stages which ended in bunch sprints.[65][66] The latter stage was decided by a photo finish, with Kittel 6?mm ahead of Edvald Boasson Hagen (Team Dimension Data); Kittel regained the green jersey.[66] In stage eight, the first high mountain stage, Lilian Calmejane of Direct nergie attacked over the category 1 climb of Monte de la Combe de Laisia Les Molunes from a six-strong lead breakaway and soloed for 11.5?km (7.1?mi) to take the win 37 seconds ahead of second placed and lone chaser Robert Gesink (LottoNLÿJumbo). Calmejane put himself into the polka dot jersey.[67] The ninth stage saw a select group of general classification favourites join Warren Barguil (Team Sunweb) after the final of the Mont du Chat and contest a sprint finish, won by Rigoberto Urn (CannondaleÿDrapac). Barguil took lead of the mountains classification.[68] Richie Porte crashed descending the Mont du Chat whilst in the group of overall contenders and withdrew from the race.[69] The following day was the Tour's first rest rest day.[38]\\r\\nStages ten and eleven were won from bunch sprints by Kittel, taking his total of wins at the race to five.[70] The twelfth stage saw the overall contenders all reach the foot of the short steep climb to Peyragudes; Romain Bardet won by a margin of two seconds. Froome came seventh, 22 seconds down, and lost the overall lead to third-placed Aru.[71] The 101?km (62.8?mi)-long stage thirteen was won by Barguil, who won the sprint after a descent from an elite group with Nairo Quintana, Alberto Contador and Mikel Landa (Team Sky). The chasing group of overall contenders came in 1 min 39 s down.[72] In the fourteenth stage, a reduced peloton contested the uphill sprint finish at Rodez, which was won Team Sunweb rider Michael Matthews. Aru's advantage of six seconds over Froome was changed to a deficit of eighteen, after Aru came in thirty seconds down in thirtieth place and Froome was seventh, one second behind the Matthews.[73]\\r\\nStage fifteen saw TrekÿSegafredo's Bauke Mollema attack a breakaway group over the top of the Col de Peyra Taillade with 31?km (19.3?mi) to go and solo to victory. In the large group containing the overall contenders, Bardet's team AG2R La Mondiale forced a high pace on the Peyra Taillade. A further 6?km (3.7?mi) later on the climb, Froome suffered a broken spoke, and, after receiving a new wheel from a teammate and some assistance from three other teammates, he was able to chase back up to the group.[74][75] The next day was the second rest day of the race.[38] In the sixteenth stage, the high pace set by Matthews's Team Sunweb dropped the green jersey wearer Kittel; Matthews, who was second to Kittel in points classification, won the stage.[76] Primo? Rogli? (LottoNLÿJumbo), second behind Barguil in the mountains classification, won the following mountainous stage after a solo attack on the Col du Galibier, finishing in Serre Chevalier after a descent over a minute ahead of a four-man group containing the new top overall top three in the general classification Froome, Urn and Bardet, respectively, and also Barguil. Aru dropped from second overall to fourth. Kittel crashed and withdrew from the Tour, putting Matthews in the green jersey.[77]\\r\\nThe final high mountain stage of the Tour, the eighteenth, saw Barguil claim his second victory of the race on the summit finish at Col d'Izoard; he was initially caught by the group of overall favourites on the final climb after being the one of last survivors from the breakaway, with only Darwin Atapuma (UAE Team Emirates) ahead. Barguil's winning move came with 3?km (1.9?mi) remaining, passing Atapuma to win by twenty seconds. A three-way sprint for fourth place saw Bardet finish just ahead of Froome with Urn placing fifth; Bardet moved up to second overall, six seconds ahead of Urn, with Froome holding a 23 second advantage.[78] Boasson Hagen won stage nineteen with an attack from a reduced breakaway with 2.5?km (1.6?mi) to go.[79] Maciej Bodnar of BoraÿHansgrohe won the 22.5?km (14.0?mi) individual time trial of the penultimate stage, setting a time of 28 min 15 s. Froome was third, six seconds down, increasing his lead in the general classification to 54 seconds. Bardet dropped to third overall after he lost over two minutes in the stage, and Urn was 31 seconds in arrears.[80]\\r\\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Dylan Groenewegen in a bunch sprint on the Champs-lyses. Froome finished the race to win his fourth Tour de France.[81] Urn placed second overall, 54 seconds down, with Bardet 2 min 20 s behind, just one second ahead of Landa (fourth overall). Matthews won the points classification with a total of 370, 136 ahead of Andr Greipel in second. Barguil won the mountains classification with 169 points, 89 ahead of second-placed Rogli?. The best young rider was seventh-placed overall Simon Yates, who was followed by Louis Meintjes (eighth overall) in second, 2 min 6 s down. An OricaÿScott rider won the classification for the second consecutive year, after Yates' twin brother Adam won in 2016. Team Sky finished as the winners of the team classification, 7 min 14 s ahead of second-placed AG2R La Mondiale.[9]\\r\\nThere were four main individual classifications being contested in the 2017 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.[82] Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The first three riders get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively.[83] For crashes within the final 3?km (1.9?mi) of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.[84] The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour.[82] The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.[82] The leader was identified by a green jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catgorie.[82] Double points were awarded on the summit finish of the Col d'Izoard on stage 18.[82] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[85]\\r\\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1992.[83] The leader wore a white jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.[83] The riders in the team that led this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.[85]\\r\\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \\"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\\".[83] No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage.[86] The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.[83] At the conclusion of the Tour, Warren Barguil won the overall super-combativity award,[9] again, decided by a jury.[83]\\r\\nA total of ?2,280,950 was awarded in cash prizes in the race.[86] The overall winner of the general classification received ?500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting ?200,000 and ?100,000 respectively.[87] All finishers in the top 160 were awarded with money.[87] The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given ?25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got ?20,000.[88] The team classification winners were given ?50,000.[89] ?11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2ÿ20.[87] There was also a special award with a prize of ?5,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider (Primo? Rogli?) to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col du Galibier on stage seventeen.[86][77]\\r\\nThe race was the 25th of the 38 events in the UCI World Tour,[90] with riders from the WorldTeams competing for individually and for their teams for points that contributed towards the rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI races.[91] Both rankings used the same points scale, awarding points to the top sixty in the general classification, each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage, the top five finishers in each stage and for the top three in the final points and mountains classcifications.[92] The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him up to sixth from twentieth in the World Tour and kept his fifth in the World Ranking. Greg Van Avermaet (BMC Racing Team) held the lead of both individual rankings, with EtixxÿQuick-Step and Belgium also holding the lead of the World Tour team ranking and World Ranking nation ranking respectively.[93][94]","input":"When does the 2017 tour de france end?"},{"output":"Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi","context":"This is a list of the highest known prices paid for paintings. The earliest sale listed (Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh) is from 1987, and more than tripled the previous record price, set only two years before, introducing a new era in the history of high sums of money paid for paintings. The sale was also significant in that for the first time a \\"modern\\" painting (in this case from 1888) became the record holder, as opposed to the old master paintings which had always previously held it. The current record price is approximately $450 million paid for Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi in November 2017.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world's most famous paintings, especially old master works done before 1803, are generally owned or held at museums, for viewing by patrons. The museums very rarely sell them, and as such, they are quite literally priceless. Guinness World Records lists the Mona Lisa as having the highest insurance value for a painting in history. On permanent display at The Louvre museum in Paris, the Mona Lisa was assessed at US$100 million on December 14, 1962. Taking inflation into account, the 1962 value would be around US$620 million in 2016.[3]\\r\\nThe earliest sale on the list below (Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers by Vincent van Gogh) is from March 1987; with a price of S24.75 million (S53.5 million in 2016 pounds sterling) it tripled the previous record and introduced a new era in top art sales. Before this, the highest absolute price paid for a painting was S8.1 million (S19.3 million in 2016 pounds sterling) paid by the J. Paul Getty Museum for Mantegna's Adoration of the Magi at Christie's in London on April 18, 1985.[4] In constant dollars, the highest price paid before 1987 was by the National Gallery of Art when in February 1967 they acquired Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra de' Benci for around $5 million ($28?million in 2016 dollars) from the Princely Family of Liechtenstein. The sale of Van Gogh's Sunflowers was also significant in that for the first time a \\"modern\\" (in this case 1888) painting became the record holder, as opposed to the old master paintings which previously had dominated the market. In contrast, there are currently only nine pre-1875 paintings among the listed top 79, and no works painted between 1635 and 1874.\\r\\nAn exceptional case is graffiti artist David Choe, who accepted payment in shares for painting graffiti art in the headquarters of a fledgling Facebook. While his shares were of limited value when he was awarded them, by the time of Facebook's IPO they were valued at around $200m.[5]\\r\\nVincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol are by far the best represented artists in the list. Whereas Picasso and Warhol became wealthy men, Van Gogh (supposedly) sold only one painting in his lifetime, The Red Vineyard, for 400 francs (about $2000 (?) in 2017) to the impressionist painter and heiress Anna Boch.[6] Prices realised for only his nine paintings in the list below, if adjusted for inflation to 2016, add up to over $885?million.\\r\\nGeorgia O'Keeffe holds the record for the highest price paid for a painting by a woman. On 20 November 2014 at Sotheby's, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art bought her 1932 painting Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1 for $44.4 million (equivalent to $45.5?million in 2016).[7][8]\\r\\nThis list is ordered by GDP deflator inflation-adjusted value (in bold) in millions of United States dollars in 2016.[note 1] Where necessary, the price is first converted to dollars using the exchange rate at the time the painting was sold.

Created by writer/artist Jim Starlin, the character first appeared in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (cover dated February 1973).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character appears in various Marvel Cinematic Universe films, portrayed by Damion Poitier in The Avengers (2012), and by Josh Brolin in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and the fourth Avengers film (2019) through voice and motion capture. The character has appeared in various comic adaptations, including animated television series, arcade, and video games.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriter-artist Jim Starlin originally conceived of Thanos of Titan during college psychology classes. As Starlin described:\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to college between doing U.S. military service and getting work in comics, and there was a psych class and I came up with Thanos?... and Drax the Destroyer, but I'm not sure how he fit into it, just anger management probably. So I came up to Marvel and [editor] Roy [Thomas] asked if I wanted to do an issue of Iron Man. I felt that this may be my only chance ever to do a character, not having the confidence that my career was going to last anything longer than a few weeks. So they got jammed into it. Thanos was a much thinner character and Roy suggested beefing him up, so he's beefed up quite a bit from his original sketches?... and later on I liked beefing him up so much that he continued to grow in size.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarlin has admitted the character's look was influenced by Jack Kirby's Darkseid:\\r\\n\\r\\nKirby had done the New Gods, which I thought was terrific. He was over at DC at the time. I came up with some things that were inspired by that. You'd think that Thanos was inspired by Darkseid, but that was not the case when I showed up. In my first Thanos drawings, if he looked like anybody, it was Metron. I had all these different gods and things I wanted to do, which became Thanos and the Titans. Roy took one look at the guy in the Metron-like chair and said: \\"Beef him up! If you're going to steal one of the New Gods, at least rip off Darkseid, the really good one!\\"[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos' first appearance was in The Invincible Iron Man #55 (February 1973), featuring a story by Jim Starlin that was co-scripted by Mike Friedrich. The storyline from that issue continued through Captain Marvel #25ÿ33 (bi-monthly: March 1973 ÿ Jan. 1974), Marvel Feature #12 (Nov. 1973), Daredevil #107 (Jan. 1974), and Avengers #125 (July 1974). He returned in an extended storyline that spanned Strange Tales #178ÿ181 (Feb.ÿAug. 1975), Warlock #9-11 (Oct. 1975 ÿ Jan. 1976), Marvel Team Up #55 (March 1977), and the 1977 Annuals for Avengers and Marvel Two-in-One (Thanos does not actually appear until the end of Warlock #9). He was also featured in a short backup story in Logan's Run #6 (June 1977) and had a small role in the Death of Captain Marvel graphic novel (April 1982).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character was revived in Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) and guest-starred until issue #59 (November 1991), while simultaneously appearing  in The Thanos Quest #1ÿ2 (Sept.ÿOct. 1990) and The Infinity Gauntlet #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 1991). After an appearance in Spider-Man #17 (Dec. 1991), Thanos had a recurring role in Warlock and the Infinity Watch #1ÿ42 (Feb. 1992 ÿ Aug. 1995). This was followed by crossover appearances in Infinity War #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1992), Infinity Crusade #1ÿ6 (June?ÿ Nov. 1993), Silver Surfer vol. 3, #86ÿ88 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Jan. 1994), Warlock Chronicles #6ÿ8, Thor #468ÿ471 (Nov. 1993?ÿ Feb. 1994), Namor The Sub-Mariner #44 (Nov. 1993), Secret Defenders #11ÿ14 (Jan.ÿApril 1994), Cosmic Powers #1ÿ6 (MarchÿJuly 1994), and Cosmic Powers Unlimited #1 (May 1995).\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos appeared in a connected storyline in Ka-Zar vol. 2, #4ÿ11 (Aug. 1997?ÿ March 1998), Ka-Zar Annual (1997), and the X-Man and Hulk Annual (1998), before featuring in Thor vol. 2, #21ÿ25 (MarchÿJuly 2000) and the 2000 Annual. The character was next used in Captain Marvel vol. 4, #17ÿ19 (JuneÿAug. 2001), Avengers: Celestial Quest #1ÿ8 (Nov. 2001?ÿ June 2002), Infinity Abyss #1ÿ6 (Aug.ÿOct. 2002) and Marvel: The End #1ÿ6 (MayÿAug 2003).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 Thanos received an eponymous title that ran for 12 issues. In 2006, the character played an important role in Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1ÿ4 (June?ÿ Sept. 2006) and Annihilation #1ÿ6 (Oct. 2006?ÿ March 2007). The character was re-introduced in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, #24ÿ25 (AprilÿMay 2010) and played a major role in The Thanos Imperative: Ignition (June 2010) and The Thanos Imperative #1ÿ6 (JulyÿDec. 2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character returned in Avengers Assemble #1 (March 2012).[3] A mini-series titled Thanos: Son of Titan by Joe Keatinge was planned for publication in August 2012, but was cancelled.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character's origin was expanded in the five-issue Thanos Rising miniseries by Jason Aaron and Simone Bianchi which was published monthly beginning in April 2013.[5] Later that same year, Thanos played a central role in the Infinity miniseries written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Jim Cheung, Jerome Ope?a, and Dustin Weaver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, Jim Starlin and Ron Lim worked together on the one-shot Thanos Annual, which is a prelude to a new trilogy of original graphic novels. The first, Thanos: The Infinity Revelation, was released the following August.[6][7] Beginning in February 2015, Starlin also penned a four-issue miniseries titled Thanos vs. Hulk, which was set prior to the graphic novels. The second installment in the trilogy, Thanos: The Infinity Relativity, was released in June, 2015.[8] The third graphic novel, Thanos: The Infinity Finale, as well as the connected mini-series The Infinity Entity were published in 2016.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time Starlin was writing these graphic novels and tie-ins, the character also appeared in New Avengers #23ÿ24 (OctÿNov 2014),[10] Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3, #18ÿ20 (OctÿDec 2014), Legendary Star-Lord #4 (Dec 2014), a six-issue miniseries titled Thanos: A God Up There Listening (Dec 2014), Avengers vol. 5, #40ÿ41 (MarÿApr 2015), and Deadpool vol. 3, #45 (\\"#250\\") (Jun 2015). Thanos also played a major role in the five-issue miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet vol. 2, (July 2015 ÿ Jan 2016), a tie-in of the cross-over Secret Wars (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos was born on Saturn's moon Titan as the son of Eternals Mentor and Sui-San, and his brother is Eros of Titan, also known as Starfox. Thanos carries the Deviants gene, and as such, shares the physical appearance of the Eternals' cousin race. At birth, his mother was shocked by his appearance and attempted to kill him, due to believing that her son would annihilate all life in the universe, but was stopped by A'Lars, Thanos' father. During his school years, Thanos was a pacifist[11] and would only play with his brother Eros (Starfox) and pets. By adolescence, Thanos had become fascinated with nihilism and death, worshipping and eventually falling in love with the physical embodiment of death, Mistress Death.[12] As an adult, Thanos augmented his physical strength and powers through his superior scientific knowledge. He also attempted to create a new life for himself by siring many children as well as becoming a pirate. He finds no fulfillment in either until he is visited again by Mistress Death, for whom he murders his offspring and his pirate captain.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nWishing to impress Mistress Death, Thanos gathers an army of villainous aliens and begins a nuclear bombardment of Titan that kills millions of his race.[14] Seeking universal power in the form of the Cosmic Cube, Thanos travels to Earth. Prior to landing, his vessel destroys a nearby car as a family witnesses his arrival.[15] Unbeknownst to Thanos, two of the family members in the vehicle survive: the father's spirit is preserved by the Titanian cosmic entity Kronos and is given a new form as Drax the Destroyer while the daughter is found by Thanos' father, Mentor, and is raised to become the heroine Moondragon. Thanos eventually locates the Cube, and also attracts the attention of Mistress Death. Willing the Cube to make him omnipotent, Thanos then discards the Cube. He imprisons Kronos and taunts Kree hero Captain Marvel, who, with the aid of superhero team the Avengers and ISAAC (a super-computer based on Titan), is eventually able to defeat Thanos by destroying the Cube.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later comes to the aid of Adam Warlock in a war against the Magus and his religious empire.[17][18] During this alliance Thanos cultivates a plan to reunite with Mistress Death, and secretly siphons off the energies of Warlock's Soul Gem, combining these with the power of the other Infinity Gems to create a weapon capable of destroying a star. Warlock summons the Avengers and Captain Marvel to stop Thanos, although the plan is foiled when Thanos kills Warlock. The Titan regroups and captures the heroes, who are freed by Spider-Man and the Thing. Thanos is finally stopped by Warlock, whose spirit emerges from the Soul Gem and turns the Titan to stone.[14][19] Thanos's spirit eventually reappears to accompany a dying Captain Marvel's soul into the realm of Death.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is eventually resurrected,[21] and collects the Infinity Gems once again.[22] He uses the gems to create the Infinity Gauntlet, making himself omnipotent, and erases half the living things in the universe to prove his love to Death.[23] This act and several other acts are soon undone by Nebula and Adam Warlock.[24] Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power. Thanos joins Warlock as part of the Infinity Watch and helps him to defeat first his evil[25] and then good[26] personas, and cure Thor of \\"warrior Madness\\".[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later recruits a team of Earth-bound super-villains and puts them under the field leadership of Geatar in a mission to capture an ancient robot containing the obscure knowledge of a universal library and extract its data.[28] Thanos uses information from the robot to plot against and battle Tyrant, the first creation of Galactus turned destroyer.[29] When trapped in an alternate dimension, Thanos employs the aid of the brother of Ka-Zar, Parnival Plunder[30] and later the Hulk[31] to escape, although both attempts are unsuccessful. Thanos is eventually freed and comes into conflict with Thor, aligning himself with Mangog in a scheme to obtain powerful mystical and cosmic talismans which will allow him to destroy all life in the universe,[32] and during their battles Thanos decimates the planet Rigel-3.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos then uses the heroes Thor and Genis-Vell (Captain Marvel's son) against the death god Walker, who attempts to woo Mistress Death and then destroy the entity after being rejected.[34] Thanos then devises a plan to become the All-Father of a new pantheon of gods created by himself. Thanos, however, finds himself opposed by the Avengers' former member Mantis and her son Quoi, who apparently is destined to be the Celestial Messiah. Thanos abandons this plan after having to unite with Mistress Death to destroy the \\"Rot\\", a cosmic aberration in deep space caused by Thanos's incessant love for Death.[35] Thanos also once conducted extensive research on genetics, studying many of the universe's heroes and villains before Cloning them, and gene-spliced his own DNA into the subjects. Although he later abandons the project, five clones survive, being versions of Professor X, Iron Man, Gladiator, Doctor Strange, and Galactus respectively. A sixth and unnamed version of Thanos also appears, and it is revealed the incarnations of Thanos encountered in the past by Thor and Ka-Zar were actually clones. The true Thanos?ÿ with the aid of Adam Warlock, Gamora, Pip the Troll, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, and Dr. Strange?ÿ destroys the remaining clones.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten uses a source of cosmic power, the Heart of the Universe, to seize power in present-day Earth (killing most of Earth's heroes in the process), Thanos uses a time-travel stratagem to defeat him. Thanos then uses the Heart of the Universe to reverse Akhenaten's actions and was also compelled to correct a flaw in the universe, for which Mistress Death kisses him, and speaks to him for the first time. Changed by the experience, Thanos advises confidant Adam Warlock he will no longer seek universal conquest.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos decides to atone for the destruction of Rigel-3, and agrees to aid a colony of Rigellians in evacuating their planet before Galactus can consume it. During the course of this mission Thanos learns Galactus is collecting the Infinity Gems in an effort to end his unyielding hunger. Thanos later learns Galactus is being manipulated into releasing a multiversal threat called Hunger, which feeds on entire universes. Despite opposition from Thanos, Galactus unwittingly frees the entity, and when its intentions are revealed, the pair team up and attempt to destroy it.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nEn route to the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death for the first time since re-building existence with the Heart of the Universe. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer something other than death. At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, who has retired himself from the role of Star-Lord, and the Strontian warrior Gladiator of the Shi'ar Empire, who are both prisoners, as well as the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn.[39] The destruction frees Thanos and his fellow inmates, and he finds himself accompanied by the chaos-mite Skreet in his plans to leave the remains of the prison. He discovers, however, that the destruction wrought by the battle with the Beyonder has freed the last prisoner brought in by Peter Quill before he gave up the title of Star-Lord: the Fallen One, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus, who had been held in a container deep in the Kyln. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control.[40] He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Annihilation War Thanos allies himself with the genocidal villain Annihilus. When the Annihilation Wave destroys the Kyln, Thanos sends the Fallen to check on the status of the Beyonder, whose mortal form he finds has perished. Before the Fallen can report back to Thanos it encounters Tenebrous and Aegis: two of Galactus's ancient foes. Thanos convinces Tenebrous and Aegis to join the Annihilation Wave in order to get revenge on Galactus, and they subsequently defeat the World Devourer and the Silver Surfer. Annihilus desires the secret of the Power Cosmic and asks Thanos to study Galactus. Once Thanos learns Annihilus's true goal is to use the Power Cosmic to destroy all life and remain the sole survivor, he decides to free Galactus. Drax the Destroyer kills Thanos before he can do so but discovers that Thanos had placed a failsafe device to allow Silver Surfer to free Galactus in the event that Annihilus betrayed him.[42] During a climactic battle with Annihilus, Nova is near death and sees Thanos standing with Mistress Death.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nA cocoon protected by the Universal Church of Truth is revealed to be hiding Thanos, who has been chosen by Oblivion to be the new Avatar of Death.[44] Resurrected before his mind could be fully formed, Thanos goes on a mindless rampage before being captured by the Guardians of the Galaxy.[45]  Thanos pretends to aid the Guardians against the invading Cancerverse, and after discovering its origin kills an alternate version of Mar-Vell, the self-proclaimed Avatar of Life. This causes the collapse of the Cancerverse, and Nova sacrifices himself in an attempt to contain Thanos inside the imploding reality.[46] Thanos escapes[47] and returns to Earth seeking an artificial cosmic cube. He forms an incarnation of the criminal group Zodiac to retrieve it, but he is defeated by the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy and remanded to the custody of the  Elders of the Universe.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos soon invades Earth again after being informed that most of the Avengers have temporarily left the planet.[49] He launches an assault on Attilan, which he offers to spare in exchange for the deaths of all Inhumans between the ages of 16 and 22. Black Bolt later informs the Illuminati that the true purpose of the invasion is to find and kill Thane, an Eternal/Inhuman hybrid that Thanos had secretly fathered years earlier.[50] Thanos is trapped in a pocket limbo of stasis by his son.[51] Thanos is freed by Namor and was among the villains that joined his Cabal to destroy other worlds.[52] Thanos later meets his end on Battleworld, where he is easily killed by God Emperor Doom during an attempted insurrection.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is unintentionally brought back to life by Galactus.[54] When Thanos prepares to raid a Project Pegasus facility to steal a Cosmic Cube, he is ambushed and defeated by a team of Avengers. During their battle, he mortally wounds War Machine and critically injures She-Hulk.[55][56][57] After his defeat, he is imprisoned in the Triskelion,[58] and manipulates Anti-Man into facilitating his escape.[59] Thanos goes on a killing spree, but Black Panther, Blue Marvel and Monica Rambeau are able to stop him by devising a device that blocks the electrical synapses in his brain.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos somehow later recovers and escapes captivity, and reclaims his Black Order forces from Corvus Glaive. After retaking command of his Black Quadrant outpost, Thanos discovers that he is dying.[61] Thanos tries to force Mentor to find a cure for his malady, but kills him when he is unable to.[62] Soon after Thanos would be battered and detained by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard after he invaded the very planet station of his father's facility sitting in their territory.[63] A quick jump into the future shows Thanos' estranged son Thane having bested his mad father with the personification of death at his side.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently locked within a maximum security cosmic Alcatraz, Thanos sits alone within a cell as his sickness ravages his body. All while being mocked by its prison warden whom he lured into a false sense of security in order to escape; ripping off his arm for escape access and murdering half his personal staff in a bid for freedom.[65] Having narrowly escaped his imprisonment before its self-destruction, Thanos retreats to a hidden outpost where a roving mercenary colony loyal only to him was once stationed. Only to find it decimated at the hand of the new lover of Mistress Death; who reveals that she'd stricken her former avatar with his fatal sickness, being his son Thane, now boasting the power of the Phoenix Force. Whom under her coaxing, had banished the mad titan back to the decimated Moon of Titan now entirely stripped of his godlike powers.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next few months, Thanos would survive alone and all but powerless in the ruins of his home city. Surviving off the flesh of mutated vermin and being accosted by local scavengers who preyed upon him in his weakened condition, he is soon picked up by the unlikely crew of Thane's betrayed cohorts Tryco Slatterus, his adopted daughter Nebula and his brother Eros of Titan.[67] Having heard of their plight, the three were dismayed to find Thanos stripped of all he was and had ever been; his second daughter only agreeing to come along so she could kill her father, immediately assaulted him.[volume?&?issue?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarfox was able to preempt her attempt at patricide while inviting his wayward tyrant of a brother aboard their vessel. Thanos mentioned the only way for him to be relieved of his mortality was to seek out the God Quarry heralded by The Witches of Infinity. Starfox initially wrote this off as fable and folklore. Now on the path to the cosmic coven set at the edge of the known universe, Thanos and crew stop short of a black hole, knowing full well that it is where the witches make their home. The Mad Titan jumps into the pinhole of nothingness alongside his brother, whom not trusting his butcherous sibling with the supposed infinite power of said collective; having survived the crushing force of the singularity they dove into, Thanos and Eros are greeted by the Coven at the godly graveyard.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos demands the three that are one to return his godhood to him. Starfox tries his best charm the enchantresses only to be rebuked by them, much to Thanos's joy when they prematurely aged him. Seeing as it was neither their place to destroy nor turn away those seeking them, The Witches profess the only way for the warlord to be made whole again was to climb down into the God Quarry and await a trial that would test his soul. Immediately after setting foot within the graveyard of old gods, Thanos is subsumed into the bedrock within which they rest.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs his journey of the core being commenced, Thanos's trial began with him as leader of earth and the universes greatest champions, the Avengers. But he's unable to escape the nagging feeling he's forgotten something, till the quarry itself wearing the guise of Falcon reminds him of who he used to be; tempting him to live as a hero and a man at peace for the first time in his immortal life. But Thanos laughs maniacally as he coldly rebukes such a path, ruthlessly killing his would be friends and allies while choosing to remain whom he always was. His cosmic might returned to him, Thanos is freed from the God Quarry, wherein he immediately accosts his brother Eros and threatens the coven to release him from their domain so that he might do away with Thane once and for all.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the time of the New Thor's appearance, Thanos is approached by a mysterious hooded woman, who proposes an alliance. He tasks her with bringing him the hammer of the deceased Ultimate Thor.[71] The woman fails, but removes her disguise to reveal herself as Hela, the Norse goddess of death. She tells Thanos that she needs his help to reclaim Hel, and in exchange, offers to give him the one thing he has been searching for his entire life: death. After this, the two kiss.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome time after his battle with Thane, Thanos travels to the Chitauri homeworld. However, upon subjugating the planet, he is attacked by a being identified only as The Rider, who captures Thanos and uses a piece of the fractured Time Stone to bring Thanos millions of years into the future, where he encounters an elderly version of himself who has destroyed nearly all life in the universe.[73] At first, Thanos believes it to be some sort of trick, but is convinced once the future Thanos utters the name Dione, which Thanos's mother had planned to name him before she went insane.[74] King Thanos reveals he needs his younger self's assistance to defeat the Fallen One, the last being left in the Universe, so that he may finally reunite with Death.[75] The Fallen One soon arrives, revealed to be a darkened Silver Surfer armed with the hordes of Annihilus and the deceased Thor's Mjolnir, using the latter to swiftly kill the Rider. The Surfer is distracted by the feral Hulk that Thanos kept chained in his basement, allowing the two Thanos to kill him using Surtur's Twilight Sword.[76] Upon the Surfer's death, Death arrives, and Thanos realizes the true reason that King Thanos brought him into the future: so that King Thanos can finally die, reasoning that if he must die, it can only be at the hands of himself. At first, Thanos is more than happy to oblige his future counterpart's request, but quickly stops, disappointed at how pathetic and submissive his older self has become. Resolving to never become as pathetic and complacent as King Thanos has become, Thanos uses the fragment of the Time Stone and the Power Cosmic left in the Surfer's corpse to return to the present day. As the future begins to crumble around him, King Thanos realizes that his younger self has taken the steps necessary to ensure that this timeline will never take place. As he fades into nothingness, King Thanos asks Death what his younger self did, to which she simply responds \\"he won.\\"[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos later discovers that the Infinity Stones are being collected once again and begins plotting to reassemble his gauntlet, however he is assaulted by Requiem, whom he apparently recognizes, and is quickly killed. She then destroys the Infinity Gauntlet and also commands the Chitauri loyal to Thanos to die.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is a mutant member of the race of superhumans known as the Titanian Eternals. The character possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutantÿEternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy. He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is also an accomplished hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained in the art of war on Titan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos has proven himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin,[79] and of blasting Galactus off his feet.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. Thanos is also a master strategist and uses several space vessels, at least three under the name \\"Sanctuary\\", as a base of operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1996 Amalgam Comics crossover between DC Comics and Marvel, Thanos merged with Darkseid to become \\"Thanoseid\\".[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the alternate universe limited series Earth X, Thanos dwelled in the Realm of the Dead with the entity Death.[82] It is revealed his mother was a Skrull and Death used her secret to make him believe that Death was his mother. When the deception is revealed, he uses the Ultimate Nullifier on Death.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ultimate Marvel imprint title Ultimate Fantastic Four features an alternate universe version of Thanos who is the ruler of Acheron (and has a son called Ronan the Accuser, who is in possession of a Cosmic Cube[84]), a vast empire consisting of thousands of worlds on another plane of existence.[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos features in the limited series Marvel Zombies 2, set in the alternate universe of Earth-2149. Having been \\"zombified\\" and recruited into the cosmically powered Galacti, the character is killed by the cosmic-powered Hulk after an altercation over food.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an unnamed alternate reality, the Rider is revived here by a variation of Odin where he plans to dispose of Thanos before he grows up to become a villain. When his Penance Stare doesn't work since the baby Thanos hasn't committed any sins yet, the Rider takes the Baby Thanos under his wing and plans to change his future this way.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nA number of the stories featuring Thanos have been republished into trade paperbacks and other collected editions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThanos was ranked number 47 on IGN's top 100 comic book villains of all time,[117] 22nd on Wizard's Top 100 Greatest Villains list,[citation needed] and number 21 on Complex's 25 Greatest Comic Book Villains List.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reddit forum /r/ThanosDidNothingWrong dedicated to sharing theories and memes about the character became very popular in July 2018 when the anticipated biggest banning in Reddit's history became viral.

By volume, it is the largest known living single stem tree on Earth.[1]\\r\\nWhile the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the largest historically-recorded tree. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) near Trinidad, California, is estimated to have been 15 to 25% larger than the General Sherman tree by volume. That tree was cut down in the mid-1940s. Another larger coast redwood, near 90,000 cubic feet, the Lindsey Creek tree, was reported in a 1905 Humboldt Times Standard article.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Sherman was named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, in 1879 by naturalist James Wolverton, who had served as a lieutenant in the 9th Indiana Cavalry under Sherman. In 1931, following comparisons with the nearby General Grant tree, General Sherman was identified as the largest tree in the world. One result of this process was that wood volume became widely accepted as the standard for establishing and comparing the size of different trees.[1][4]\\r\\nIn January 2006 the largest branch on the tree (seen most commonly, in older photos, as an \\"L\\" or golf-club shape, protruding from about a quarter of the way down the trunk) broke off. There were no witnesses to the incident, and the branch  larger than most tree trunks; diameter over 2?m (6.6?ft) and length over 30?m (98?ft)  smashed part of the perimeter fence and cratered the pavement of the surrounding walkway. The breakage is not believed to be indicative of any abnormalities in the tree's health, and may even be a natural defense mechanism against adverse weather conditions.[5]\\r\\nWhile it is the largest tree known, the General Sherman Tree is neither the tallest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to the Hyperion tree, a Coast redwood),[6] nor is it the widest (both the largest cypress and largest baobab have a greater diameter), nor is it the oldest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to a Great Basin bristlecone pine).[7] With a height of 83.8 meters (275?ft), a diameter of 7.7?m (25?ft), an estimated bole volume of 1,487?m3 (52,513?cu?ft), and an estimated age of 2,300ÿ2,700 years,[8][9][10] it is nevertheless among the tallest, widest, and longest-lived of all trees on the planet.\\r\\nCoordinates: 363454N 1184505.5W? / ?36.58167N 118.751528W? / 36.58167; -118.751528","input":"Where is the world's largest tree located?"},{"output":"16 September 1975","context":"The prehistory of Papua New Guinea can be traced to about 60,000 years ago, when people first migrated towards the Australian continent. The written history began when European navigators first sighted New Guinea in the early part of the 16th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nArchaeological evidence indicates that humans arrived on New Guinea perhaps 60,000 years ago, although this is under debate.[1][2] They came probably by sea from Southeast Asia during an Ice Age period when the sea was lower and distances between islands shorter. Although the first arrivals were hunters and gatherers, early evidence shows that people managed the forest environment to provide food. There also are indications of neolithic gardening having been practiced at Kuk at the same time that agriculture was developing in Mesopotamia and Egypt. Today's staples?ÿ sweet potatoes and pigs?ÿ were later arrivals, but shellfish and fish have long been mainstays of coastal dwellers' diets. Recent archaeological research suggests that 50,000 years ago people may have occupied sites in the highlands at altitudes of up to 2,000?m (6,600?ft), rather than being restricted to warmer coastal areas.[3]\\r\\nWhen Europeans first arrived, inhabitants of New Guinea and nearby islands, whose technologies included bone, wood, and stone tools, had a productive agricultural system. They traded along the coast (mainly in pottery, shell ornaments and foodstuffs) and in the interior (exchanging forest products for shells and other sea products).\\r\\nThe first known Europeans to sight New Guinea were probably the Portuguese and Spanish navigators sailing in the South Pacific in the early part of the 16th century. In 1526ÿ1527 the Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes accidentally came upon the principal island and is credited with naming it \\"Papua\\", after a Malay word for the frizzled quality of Melanesian people's hair. The Spaniard Y?igo Ortiz de Retez applied the term \\"New Guinea\\" to the island in 1545 because of a perceived resemblance between the islands' inhabitants and those found on the African Guinea coast.\\r\\nAlthough European navigators visited the islands and explored their coastlines thereafter, European researchers knew little of the inhabitants until the 1870s, when Russian anthropologist Nicholai Miklukho-Maklai made a number of expeditions to New Guinea, spending several years living among native tribes, and described their way of life in a comprehensive treatise.\\r\\nIn 1883, the Colony of Queensland tried to annex the southern half of eastern New Guinea, but the British government did not approve. However, when Germany began settlements in the north a British protectorate was proclaimed in 1884 over the southern coast of New Guinea and its adjacent islands. The protectorate, called British New Guinea, was annexed outright on 4 September 1888. The possession was placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1902. Following the passage of the Papua Act in 1905, British New Guinea became the Territory of Papua, and formal Australian administration began in 1906, although Papua remained under their control a British possession until the independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975.[4]\\r\\nThere was little economic activity in Papua. Australia administered it separately under the Papua Act until it was invaded by the Empire of Japan in 1941, and civil administration suspended. During the Pacific War, Papua was governed by an Australian military administration from Port Moresby, where General Douglas MacArthur occasionally made his headquarters.\\r\\nWith Europe's growing desire for coconut oil, Godeffroy's of Hamburg, the largest trading firm in the Pacific, began trading for copra in the New Guinea Islands. In 1884, the German Empire formally took possession of the northeast quarter of the island and put its administration in the hands of a chartered trading company formed for the purpose, the German New Guinea Company. In the charter granted to this company by the German Imperial Government in May 1885, it was given the power to exercise sovereign rights over the territory and other \\"unoccupied\\" lands in the name of the government, and the ability to \\"negotiate\\" directly with the native inhabitants. Relationships with foreign powers were retained as the preserve of the German government. The Neu Guinea Kompanie paid for the local governmental institutions directly, in return for the concessions which had been awarded to it. In 1899, the German imperial government assumed direct control of the territory, thereafter known as German New Guinea.\\r\\nNew Guinea was basically a business venture. Thousands of local workers were hired as cheap labor on cocoa and copra plantations. In 1899, the German government took control of the colony from the New Guinea company of Berlin. Education was in the hands of missionaries. In 1914 when the First World War broke out Australia seized the German colony. The plantations were given to Australian war veterans and in 1921 the League of Nations gave Australia a trusteeship over New Guinea. The plantations and gold mining generated a degree of prosperity.[5]\\r\\nThe Commonwealth of Australia assumed a mandate from the League of Nations for governing the former German territory of New Guinea in 1920. It was administered under this mandate until the Japanese invasion in December 1941 brought about the suspension of Australian civil administration. Much of the Territory of New Guinea, including the islands of Bougainville and New Britain, was occupied by Japanese forces before being recaptured by Australian and American forces during the final months of the war (see New Guinea campaign).\\r\\nThe exploration of PapuaÿNew Guinea has been a continuing process. Even today (October 2017) new groups of people occasionally are still contacted. Not until recent years has New Guineas exploration been planned; much of it has been the work of miners, labour recruiters, missionaries, adventurers, with different objectives in mind. Many of these people have been doers, not recorders of facts, with the result that our knowledge of the territorys exploration has not kept pace with the exploration itself.[6]\\r\\nAn exception is the record of the Akmana Gold Prospecting Companys Field Party which carried out two expeditions from September to December 1929 and from mid February to the end of June 1930.[7] They journeyed on the \\"Banyandah\\", a cruiser of 12 metres (38?ft) from Madang up the coast to the mouth of the Sepik River, travelling along that river to Marienberg and Moim, then along the Karosameri River to the Karrawaddi River and on to the Arrabundio River and Yemas, after which it was necessary to transport their stores and equipment by pinnace, canoe and ultimately on foot to their Mountain Base on the upper Arrabundio River.\\r\\nDuring their first expedition the Akmana Field Party prospected the tributaries of the Arrabundio and then trekked across a spur of the Central Mountain Range to sample the Upper Karrawaddi River. Retracing their steps to the Arrabundio they then headed out across another spur of the Central Mountain Range to the Junction of the Yuat River with the Jimmi and Baiyer Rivers, again without finding gold in sufficient quantity. Returning to Madang at the end of December 1929, several of the party went back to Sydney to obtain instructions from the Akmana Gold Prospecting Company.\\r\\nIn mid February 1930 the second expedition quickly returned to their Mountain Base and on across the mountains to the junction of the Yuat with the Baiyer and Jimmi Rivers. They prospected south along the Baiyer River to its junction with the Maramuni and Tarua Rivers, where they established a palisaded forward camp naming the place Akmana Junction. From this base they prospected along the Maramuni River and its tributaries, again without success. Finally they prospected the Tarua River south past the tributary which flows to Waipai, once more without success and on the advice of mining engineer Seale, it was decided there was nothing to justify further exploration. They had not progressed to any country on the southern watershed through which the early explorers and prospectors travelled to the Hagan Range and Wabag. The party returned to Madang, sailing for Sydney on 3 July 1930.\\r\\nAfter leading the first expedition, Sam Freeman did not return and Reg Beazley became party leader of the second expedition, with Pontey Seale mining engineer, Bill MacGregor and Beazley prospectors and recruiters, and Ernie Shepherd in charge of transport and supplies, prospecting when opportunity arose. They had all served overseas during World War I with the AIF on the western front, in Egypt and the Levant and had previously been to New Guinea. In 1926 Freeman was near Marienberg with Ormildah drilling for oil; Shepherd was with Dr. Wade and R.J. Winters on their geological survey of an oil lease of 26,000 square kilometres (10,000?sq?mi) in the Bogia and Nubio to Ramu region and up the Sepik River to Kubka 100?km (60?mi) above Ambunto. Beazley was drilling test sites for oil with Matahower in the lower Sepik and he and McGregor recruited labour on the Sepik and explored grass country to Wee Wak. Beazley also prospected the Arrabundio for gold and on his promising report to Freeman, Akmana Gold Prospecting Coy was floated in 1928.\\r\\nThe Akmana Gold Prospecting Field Party made contact with many peoples they called: grass country people, head hunters, pygmies, wigÿmen, Kanakas, Poomani. These contacts were often with the help of Drybow/Dribu, a leader and spokesman of the wigÿmen, a most intelligent man of goodwill, with a quiet authority that brought forth friendly cooperation. We made a peaceful entry into this new country, establishing a reputation for fair trade and decent behaviour ... but gold was our interest and we had traced the rivers and tributaries as far as practicable where conditions and results justified the effort and found nothing worthwhile. In the many years since, there have been quite a few reports of prospecting parties in the area. But nothing of note has been reported: So we did not leave much behind, it seems.[8]\\r\\nMembers of the Akmana party donated wigs they had brought back to various museums. Two of them went to The Australian Museum, Sydney (from Beazley and Shepherd). Current records at the Australian Museum show that Beazleys wig, described as a cap composed of human hair from the headwaters of the Uÿat River, Central Mountains, Mandated Territory of NG, was lodged on 31 January 1930, presumably on his quick visit to Sydney after the first expedition. Shepherd presented another wig to Father Kirschbaum, who wanted to send it to Germany. The wigs at The Australian Museum were later confused with some brought out of the Highlands 10 years afterwards by Jim Taylor during his HagenÿSepik patrol, and wrongly attributed to him when put on display. Seale presented two wigs to the National Museum Canberra in 1930.[9]\\r\\nShortly after the start of the Pacific War, the island of New Guinea was invaded by the Japanese. Most of West Papua, at that time known as Dutch New Guinea, was occupied, as were large parts of the Territory of New Guinea (the former German New Guinea, which was also under Australian rule after World War I), but Papua was protected to a large extent by its southern location and the near-impassable Owen Stanley Ranges to the north.\\r\\nThe New Guinea campaign opened with the battles for New Britain and New Ireland in the Territory of New Guinea in 1942. Rabaul, the capital of the Territory was overwhelmed on 22ÿ23 January and was established as a major Japanese base from whence they landed on mainland New Guinea and advanced towards Port Moresby and Australia.[10] Having had their initial effort to capture Port Moresby by a seaborne invasion disrupted by the U.S. Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Japanese attempted a landward invasion from the north via the Kokoda Trail. From July 1942, a few Australian reserve battalions, many of them very young and untrained, fought a stubborn rearguard action against a Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track, towards Port Moresby, over the rugged Owen Stanley Ranges.[11] Local Papuans, called Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels by the Australians, assisted and escorted injured Australian troops down the Kokoda trail. The militia, worn out and severely depleted by casualties, were relieved in late August by regular troops from the Second Australian Imperial Force, returning from action in the Mediterranean theatre.\\r\\nThe Japanese were driven back. The bitter Battle of Buna-Gona followed in which Australian and United States forces attacked the main Japanese beachheads in New Guinea, at Buna, Sanananda and Gona. Facing tropical disease, difficult terrain and well constructed Japanese defences, the allies only secured victory with heavy casualties.[12]\\r\\nIn early September 1942 Japanese marines attacked a strategic Royal Australian Air Force base at Milne Bay, near the eastern tip of Papua. They were beaten back by the Australian Army, and the Battle of Milne Bay is remembered as the first outright defeat on Japanese land forces during World War II.[13] The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943ÿ44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces.[14] The Supreme Commander of operations was the United States General Douglas MacArthur, with Australian General Thomas Blamey taking a direct role in planning and operations being essentially directed by staff at New Guinea Force headquarters in Port Moresby.[15] Bitter fighting continued in New Guinea between the largely Australian force and the Japanese 18th Army based in New Guinea until the Japanese surrender in 1945.\\r\\nThe New Guinea campaign was a major campaign of the Pacific War. In all, some 200,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the campaign against approximately 7,000 Australian and 7,000 American service personnel.[16]\\r\\nFollowing the surrender of the Japanese in 1945, civil administration of Papua as well as New Guinea was restored, and under the Papua New Guinea Provisional Administration Act, (1945ÿ46), Papua and New Guinea were combined in an administrative union.\\r\\nThe Papua and New Guinea Act 1949 formally approved the placing of New Guinea under the international trusteeship system and confirmed the administrative union under the title of The Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The Act provided for a Legislative Council (established in 1951), a judicial organization, a public service, and a system of local government, with Sir Donald Cleland as administrator. Cleland remained in the position till his retirement in 1967, then remaining in Port Moresby until his death in 1975.[17] The House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea replaced the Legislative Council in 1963, and after elections on 15 February, opened on 8 June 1964. In 1972, the name of the territory was changed to Papua New Guinea. Australia's change of policy towards Papua New Guinea largely commenced with the invitation from the Australian Government to the World Bank to send a mission to the Territory to advise on measures to be taken towards its economic development and political preparation. The mission's report, The Economic Development of the Territory of Papua New Guinea, published in 1964, set out the framework upon which much of later economic policy, up to and beyond independence, proceeded.\\r\\nElections in 1972 resulted in the formation of a ministry headed by Chief Minister Michael Somare, who pledged to lead the country to self-government and then to independence. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973 and achieved independence on 16 September 1975. The country joined the United Nations (UN) on 10 October 1975 by way of Security Council Resolution 375 and General Assembly resolution 3368. The 1977 national elections confirmed Michael Somare as Prime Minister at the head of a coalition led by the Pangu Party. However, his government lost a vote of confidence in 1980 and was replaced by a new cabinet headed by Sir Julius Chan as prime minister. The 1982 elections increased Pangu's plurality, and parliament again chose Somare as prime minister. In November 1985, the Somare government lost another vote of no confidence, and the parliamentary majority elected Paias Wingti, at the head of a five-party coalition, as prime minister. A coalition, headed by Wingti, was victorious in very close elections in July 1987. In July 1988, a no-confidence vote toppled Wingti and brought to power Rabbie Namaliu, who a few weeks earlier had replaced Somare as leader of the Pangu Party.\\r\\nSuch reversals of fortune and a revolving-door succession of prime ministers continue to characterize Papua New Guinea's national politics. A plethora of political parties, coalition governments, shifting party loyalties and motions of no confidence in the leadership all lend an air of instability to political proceedings.\\r\\nUnder legislation intended to enhance stability, new governments remain immune from no-confidence votes for the first 18 months of their incumbency.\\r\\nA nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville claimed some 20,000 lives. The rebellion began in early 1989, active hostilities ended with a truce in October 1997 and a permanent ceasefire was signed in April 1998. A peace agreement between the Government and ex-combatants was signed in August 2001. A regional peace-monitoring force and a UN observer mission monitors the government and provincial leaders who have established an interim administration and are working toward complete surrender of weapons, the election of a provincial government and an eventual referendum on independence.\\r\\nAlthough close relations have been maintained since peaceful independence and Australia remains the largest bilateral aid donor to Papua New Guinea, relations with Australia have recently shown signs of strain. While on an official visit in March 2005, the PNG Prime Minister, Michael Somare, was asked to submit to a security check and remove his shoes upon arriving at the airport in Brisbane. Despite demands from the PNG government that Australia apologize, the latter refused. Additionally, problems have arisen with regard to Australia's latest aid package for the country. Valued at A$760 million, the program was to tackle crime and corruption in PNG by sending 200 Australian police to Port Moresby and installing 40 Australian officials within the national bureaucracy. However, after the first detachment of police arrived, Papua New Guinea's high court ruled that the arrangement was unconstitutional, and the police returned home. A new arrangement, by which only 30 officers will serve as a training force for the local force has been described by the Australian foreign minister as \\"second-best\\".[18]\\r\\nThe government and rebels negotiated a peace agreement that established the Bougainville Autonomous District and Province. The autonomous Bougainville elected Joseph Kabui as president in 2005, who served until his death in 2008. He was succeeded by his deputy John Tabinaman as acting president while an election to fill the unexpired term was organised. James Tanis won that election in December 2008 and served until the inauguration of John Momis, the winner of the 2010 elections. As part of the current peace settlement, a referendum on independence is planned to be held in Bougainville sometime before mid-2020. Preparations were underway in 2015.[19][20]\\r\\nNumerous Chinese have worked and lived in Papua New Guinea, establishing Chinese-majority communities. Chinese merchants became established in the islands before European exploration. Anti-Chinese rioting involving tens of thousands of people broke out in May 2009. The initial spark was a fight between ethnic Chinese and Papua New Guinean workers at a nickel factory under construction by a Chinese company. Native resentment against Chinese ownership of numerous small businesses and their commercial monopoly in the islands led to the rioting. The Chinese have long been merchants in Papua New Guinea.[21][22] On the same year, Papua New Guinea asked various Southeast nations for their support for Papua New Guinea's full membership bid in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Indonesia supported the bid after Papua New Guinea supported Indonesia's hold on West Papua. However, Christian-majority Philippines and Buddhist-majority Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia have expressed displeasure over Papua New Guinea's anti-LGBT laws, stating that equality-friendly Timor-Leste would most likely be a more feasible ASEAN member state in the future.[23][24]\\r\\nIn 2012, despite a refugee crisis between the borders of Papua New Guinea and West Papua, the country was steadfast in its support to Indonesia, which promised Papua New Guinea a bigger role in ASEAN in the future. By 2017, the Indonesian-led genocide against West Papuan natives peaked with almost 25% of the native population killed within a 50-year period.[25][26] The realization caused massive backlash from Oceania nations against Papua New Guinea's policy on West Papua. In January 2017, Papua New Guinea gave citizenship to 138 West Papuan refugees in a bid to calm tensions.[27] In September 2017, Papua New Guinea rejected the West Papuan Independence Petition in the United Nations General Assembly, to the pleasure of Indonesia.[28]\\r\\nFrom April to March 2018, a chain of earthquakes hit Papua New Guinea, causing various damages. Various nations from Oceania, Australia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste immediately sent aid to the country.[29][30]","input":"When did papua new guinea become an independent country?"},{"output":"November 1967","context":"\\"I Am the Walrus\\" is a song by the Beatles released in November 1967. It was featured in the Beatles' television film Magical Mystery Tour in December of that year, as a track on the associated British double EP of the same name and its American counterpart LP, and was the B-side to the number 1 hit single \\"Hello, Goodbye\\". Since the single and the double EP held at one time in December 1967 the top two slots on the British singles chart, the song had the distinction of being at number 1 and number 2 simultaneously.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Lennon received a letter from a pupil at Quarry Bank High School, which he had attended. The writer mentioned that the English master was making his class analyse Beatles' lyrics. (Lennon wrote an answer, dated 1 September 1967, which was auctioned by Christie's of London in 1992.) Lennon, amused that a teacher was putting so much effort into understanding the Beatles' lyrics, decided to write in his next song the most confusing lyrics that he could.\\r\\nAccording to author Ian MacDonald, the \\"model\\" for \\"I Am the Walrus\\" was most likely Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which was a hit single during the summer of 1967 and Lennon's favourite song of the period.[1] The lyrics came from three song ideas that Lennon had been working on, the first of which was inspired by hearing a police siren at his home in Weybridge; Lennon wrote the lines \\"Mis-ter cit-y police-man\\" to the rhythm and melody of the siren. The second idea was a short rhyme about Lennon sitting amidst his garden, while the third was a nonsense lyric about sitting on a corn flake. Unable to finish the three different songs, he combined them into one. The lyrics also included the phrase \\"Lucy in the sky\\", a reference to the Beatles' earlier song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\".\\r\\nThe walrus refers to Lewis Carroll's poem \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" (from the book Through the Looking-Glass).[2] Lennon later expressed dismay upon belatedly realising that the walrus was a villain in the poem.[3]\\r\\nThe final piece of the song came together when Lennon's friend and former fellow member of the Quarrymen, Pete Shotton visited, and Lennon asked him about a playground nursery rhyme they sang as children. Shotton recalled the rhyme as follows:\\r\\nYellow matter custard, green slop pie,\\r\\nAll mixed together with a dead dog's eye,\\r\\nSlap it on a butty, ten foot thick,\\r\\nThen wash it all down with a cup of cold sick.[4]\\r\\nLennon borrowed a couple of images from the first two lines. Shotton was also responsible for suggesting that Lennon change the lyric \\"waiting for the man to come\\" to \\"waiting for the van to come\\". The Beatles' official biographer, Hunter Davies, was present while the song was being written and wrote an account in his 1968 book The Beatles. According to this biography, Lennon remarked to Shotton, \\"Let the fuckers work that one out.\\" While the band were studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968, George Harrison told journalist Lewis Lapham that one of the lines in \\"I Am the Walrus\\" incorporated the personal mantra he had received from their meditation teacher, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.[5] According to Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife at the time, the words \\"semolina pilchard\\" refer to Sergeant Pilcher of the London Drug Squad, who waged a campaign against British rock stars and underground figures during the late 1960s.[6]\\r\\nLennon claimed he wrote the first two lines on separate acid trips; he explained much of the song to Playboy in 1980:[7]\\r\\nThe first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko ... I'd seen Allen Ginsberg and some other people who liked Dylan and Jesus going on about Hare Krishna. It was Ginsberg, in particular, I was referring to. The words 'Element'ry penguin' meant that it's na?ve to just go around chanting Hare Krishna or putting all your faith in one idol. In those days I was writing obscurely,  la Dylan. [...]\\r\\nIt never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles' work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, shit, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, 'I am the carpenter.' But that wouldn't have been the same, would it? [Sings, laughing] 'I am the carpenter ...'\\r\\nAll the chords are major chords or seventh chords, and all the musical letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G) are used. The song ends using a Shepard tone, with a chord progression built on ascending and descending lines in the bass and strings, repeated as the song fades. Musicologist Alan W. Pollack analyses: \\"The chord progression of the outro itself is a harmonic Moebius strip with scales in bassline and top voice that move in contrary motion.\\"[8] The bassline descends stepwise A, G, F, E, D, C, and B, while the strings part rises A, B, C, D, E, F?, G: this sequence repeats as the song fades, with the strings rising higher on each iteration. Pollack also notes that the repeated cell is seven bars long, which means that a different chord begins each four-bar phrase. The fade is described by Walter Everett as a \\"false ending\\", in the form of an \\"unrelated coda\\" consisting of the orchestral chord progression, chorus, and sampling of the radio play.[9]\\r\\nThe song is in the key of A, and the instrumental introduction starts in the Lydian mode of B major.[10] Verse 1 begins with a Iÿ?IIIÿIVÿI rock pattern: \\"I am he\\" (A chord)...\\"you are me\\" (C chord) \\"and we are all toge...\\" (D chord) \\"...ther\\" (A chord). Verse 2, however, involves a ?VIÿ?VIIÿI Aeolian ascent: \\"waiting\\" (F chord) \\"for the van\\" (G chord) \\"to come\\" (A chord). The chorus uses a ?IIIÿIVÿV pattern: \\"I am the eggman (C chord) \\"they are the eggmen (D chord). \\"I am the walrus (E chord), \\"goo goo g'joob\\" hanging as an imperfect cadence until resolved with the I (A chord) on \\"Mr. City Policeman\\".[11] At the line \\"Sitting in an English garden\\" the D? melody note (as in the instrumental introduction) establishes a Lydian mode (sharp 4th note in the scale), and this mode is emphasised more strongly with the addition of a D? note to the B chord on \\"If the sun don't come\\".[12]\\r\\n\\"I Am the Walrus\\" was the first studio recording made by the Beatles after the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, in August 1967. The basic backing track featuring the Beatles was released in 1996 on Anthology 2. George Martin arranged and added orchestral accompaniment that included violins, cellos, horns, and clarinet. Paul McCartney said that Lennon gave instructions to Martin as to how he wished the orchestration to be scored, including singing most of the parts as a guide. A 16-voice choir of professional studio vocalists named the Mike Sammes Singers took part in the recording as well, variously singing \\"Ho-ho-ho, hee-hee-hee, ha-ha-ha\\", \\"oompah, oompah, stick it up your jumper!\\", \\"everybody's got one\\" and making a series of shrill whooping noises.[13] The \\"stick it up your jumper\\" refrain originated with the 1930s novelty song \\"Umpa, Umpa (Stick It Up Your Jumper)\\" by The Two Leslies.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2015, founding Moody Blues member Ray Thomas said in an interview that he and fellow band member Mike Pinder contributed backing vocals to the song, as well as harmonicas to \\"The Fool on the Hill\\".[14]\\r\\nThe dramatic reading in the mix is Shakespeare's King Lear (Act IV, Scene 6), lines 219ÿ222 and 249ÿ262.[15] It was added to the song on 29 September 1967,[16] recorded directly from an AM radio Lennon was fiddling with. Lennon tuned around the dial and settled on the 7:30?pm to 11?pm[17] broadcast of the play on the BBC Third Programme.[18]\\r\\nThe first excerpt (ll. 219ÿ222) moves in and out of the text, containing fragments of lines only. It begins where the disguised Edgar talks to his estranged and maliciously blinded father the Earl of Gloucester (timings given[15]):\\r\\nGloucester: (2:35) Now, good sir, wh (Lennon appears to change the channel away from the station here)[15]\\r\\nEdgar: (2:38)  poor man, made tame by fortune  (2:44) good pity \\r\\nIn the play Edgar then kills Oswald, Goneril's steward. During the fade of the song the second main extract (ll. 249ÿ262), this time of continuous text, is heard (timings given[15]):[15][19]\\r\\nOswald: (3:52) Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\\r\\nIf ever thou wilt thrive, (4:02) bury my body,\\r\\nAnd give the (4:05) letters which thou find'st about me\\r\\nTo (4:08) Edmund, Earl of Gloucester; (4:10) seek him out\\r\\nUpon the British party. O, (4:14) untimely Death!\\r\\nEdgar: (4:23) I know thee well: a (4:25) serviceable villain;\\r\\nAs duteous to the (4:27) vices of thy mistress\\r\\nAs badness would desire.\\r\\nGloucester: What, is he dead?\\r\\nEdgar: (4:31) Sit you down father, rest you.\\r\\nOn the radio broadcast the roles were read by Mark Dignam (Gloucester), Philip Guard (Edgar), and John Bryning (Oswald).[16]\\r\\nIn the original (1967) stereo release, at around two minutes through the song, the mix changes from true stereo to \\"fake stereo\\". This came about because the radio broadcast had been added \\"live\\" into the mono mix-down and so was unavailable for inclusion in the stereo mix; hence, fake stereo from the mono mix was created for this portion of the song.[20]\\r\\nThe mono version opens with a four-beat chord, while the stereo mix features six beats on the initial chord. The four-beat-only intro is also included on a different stereo mix (overseen by George Martin) for the previous MPI Home Video version of Magical Mystery Tour, especially the US Magical Mystery Tour album. The US mono single mix includes an extra bar of music before the words \\"yellow matter custard\\". This is actually the original uncut version of the mono mix called RM23. An early, overdub-free mix of the song released on Anthology 2 reveals John singing the lyrics \\"Yellow mat-\\" too earlythis was edited out. A hybrid version prepared for the 1980 US Rarities LP combines the six-beat opening with the extra bar of music that precedes the words \\"yellow matter custard\\" (from the aforementioned US mono single mix).[21] An entirely new full stereo remix was done in 2012 for Apple's DVD and Blu-ray release of the restored version of Magical Mystery Tour.\\r\\nA 5.1 surround sound full stereo remix of the song appeared on the DVD release of Anthology in 2003, on disc 4. A full stereo digital remix was also done for the Cirque du Soleil show Love and album of the same name, released in 2006. Producers George and Giles Martin were allowed access to early generations of the original master tapes. Musical parts that had previously been mixed were now available as separate elements. Additionally, a copy of the BBC broadcast of King Lear was acquired. Now, with all the sound sources used in the original mono mix present, a proper stereo remix could be accomplished. These tracks were transferred digitally and lined up to create a new multi-track master, from which a new mix would be made.\\r\\nIn addition to the stereo remixes prepared for the Love show and the 2012 Apple reissue referenced above, the DVDs that were released for those same projects contain a 5.1 surround sound mix of the song, making three distinct 5.1 remixes of the same song.\\r\\nIn Spring/Summer 1988 a Dutch radio station aired a no-overdub version that was acquired through dubious raids on the Apple vaults and titled Beatles unlimited. (Private copy, used by owner only, is noted here.)\\r\\nCritical reception at the time of the track's release was largely positive:\\r\\nThe song was banned by the BBC for the use of the word \\"knickers\\" in the line \\"Youve been a naughty girl, youve let your knickers down\\".[25][26]\\r\\nAlthough it has been reported that Lennon wrote \\"I Am the Walrus\\" to confuse those who tried to interpret his songs, there have nevertheless been many attempts to analyse the meaning of the lyrics.[27][28]\\r\\nSeen in the Magical Mystery Tour film singing the song, Lennon, apparently, is the walrus; on the track-list of the accompanying soundtrack album, however, underneath \\"I Am the Walrus\\" are printed the words \\" 'No you're not!' said Little Nicola\\" (in the film, Nicola Hale is a little girl who keeps contradicting everything the other characters say). Lennon returned to the subject in the lyrics of three of his subsequent songs: in the 1968 Beatles song \\"Glass Onion\\" he sings, \\"I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man / You know that we're as close as can be, man / Well here's another clue for you all / The walrus was Paul\\";[29] in the third verse of \\"Come Together\\" he sings the line \\"he bag production, he got walrus gumboot\\"; and in his 1970 solo song \\"God\\", admits: \\"I was the walrus, but now I'm John\\".\\r\\nEric Burdon, lead singer of the Animals, claims to be the \\"Eggman\\" mentioned in the song's lyric. Burdon was known as \\"Eggs\\" to his friends, the nickname originating from his fondness for breaking eggs over naked women's bodies.[citation needed] Burdon's biography mentions such an affair taking place in the presence of John Lennon, who shouted \\"Go on, go get it, Eggman...\\"[30]","input":"When was i am the walrus released in the uk?"},{"output":"more than 2500 times in the Hebrew Bible","context":"Elohim (Hebrew: ????????? ?lh?m [??lo??him]) is one of the many names or titles for God in the Hebrew Bible; the term is also used in the Hebrew Bible to refer to other gods.\\r\\nThe notion of divinity underwent radical changes in the early period of Israelite identity and development of Ancient Hebrew religion. The ambiguity of the term elohim is the result of such changes, cast in terms of \\"vertical translatability\\", i.e. the re-interpretation of the gods of the earliest recalled period as the national god of monolatrism as it emerged in the 7th to 6th century BCE in the Kingdom of Judah and during the Babylonian captivity, and further in terms of monotheism by the emergence of Rabbinical Judaism in the 2nd century CE.[1]\\r\\nThe word is identical to the usual plural of el meaning gods or magistrates, and is cognate to the 'l-h-m found in Ugaritic, where it is used for the pantheon of Canaanite gods, the children of El, and conventionally vocalized as \\"Elohim\\". Most use of the term Elohim in the later Hebrew text imply a view that is at least monolatrist at the time of writing, and such usage (in the singular), as a proper title for the supreme deity, is generally not considered to be synonymous with the term elohim, \\"gods\\" (plural, simple noun). Hebrew grammar allows for this nominally plural form to mean \\"He is the Power (singular) over powers (plural)\\", or roughly, \\"God of gods\\". Rabbinic scholar Maimonides wrote that the various other usages are commonly understood to be homonyms.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElohim is a grammatically plural noun for \\"gods\\" or \\"deity\\" in Biblical Hebrew. In Modern Hebrew, it is often referred to in the singular despite the -im ending that denotes plural masculine nouns in Hebrew.[3][4]\\r\\nIn Hebrew, the ending -im normally indicates a masculine plural. However, when referring to the Hebrew God, Elohim is usually understood to be grammatically singular (i.e. it governs a singular verb or adjective). A possibly another related world is Ilhؐn (??????), meaning two gods, while alؐha (gods, ???) is the collective form of ؐlah (a god, ???)[citation needed]. Note that names of human beings in Arabic and Hebrew can also have plural endings like Ibrahim, Abraham in Arabic, and Ephraim, the son of Joseph.\\r\\nIt is generally thought that Elohim is derived from eloah, the latter being an expanded form of the Northwest Semitic noun il.[5] The related nouns eloah (????) and el (???) are used as proper names or as generics, in which case they are interchangeable with elohim.[5] The term contains an added heh as third radical to the biconsonantal root. Discussions of the etymology of elohim essentially concern this expansion. An exact cognate outside of Hebrew is found in Ugaritic ?lhm, the family of El, the creator god and chief deity of the Canaanite pantheon, in Biblical Aramaic ??lh and later Syriac Alaha \\"God\\", and in Arabic ?ilh \\"god, deity\\" (or Allah as \\"The [single] God\\").\\r\\n\\"El\\" (the basis for the extended root ?lh) is usually derived from a root meaning \\"to be strong\\" and/or \\"to be in front\\".[5]\\r\\nThe word el (singular) is a standard term for \\"god\\" in Aramaic, paleo-Hebrew, and other related Semitic languages including Ugaritic. The Canaanite pantheon of gods was known as 'ilhm,[6] the Ugaritic equivalent to elohim.[7] For instance, in the Ugaritic Baal cycle we read of \\"seventy sons of Asherah\\". Each \\"son of god\\" was held to be the originating deity for a particular people. (KTU 2 1.4.VI.46).[8]\\r\\nElohim occurs frequently throughout the Torah. In some cases (e.g. Exodus 3:4, \\"... Elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush ...\\"), it behaves like a singular noun in Hebrew grammar, and is then generally understood to denote the single God of Israel. In other cases, Elohim acts as an ordinary plural of the word Eloah, and refers to the polytheistic notion of multiple gods (for example, Exodus 20:3, \\"You shall have no other gods before me.\\").\\r\\nThe words used for God varies in the Hebrew Bible. According to the documentary hypothesis these variations are the products of different source texts: Elohim is used as the name of God in the Elohist (E) and Priestly (P) sources, while the name Yahweh is used in the Jahwist (J) source. Form criticism postulates the differences of names may be the result of geographical origins; the P and E sources coming from the North and J from the South. There may be a theological point, that God did not reveal his name, Yahweh, before the time of Moses, though Hans Heinrich Schmid showed that the Jahwist was aware of the prophetic books from the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.[9]\\r\\nJ presents Yahweh anthropomorphically: for example, walking through the Garden of Eden looking for Adam and Eve. The Elohist often presents Elohim as more distant and frequently involves angels, as in the Elohist version of the tale of Jacob's ladder, in which there is a ladder to the clouds, with angels climbing up and down, with Elohim at the top. In the Jahwist tale, Yahweh is simply stationed in the sky, above the clouds without the ladder or angels. Likewise, the Elohist describes Jacob wrestling with an angel.\\r\\nThe classical documentary hypothesis, first developed in the late 19th century CE among literary scholars, holds that the Elohist portions of the Torah were composed in the 9th century BCE (i.e. during the early period of the Kingdom of Judah). This, however, is not universally accepted as later literary scholarship seems to show evidence of a later \\"Elohist redaction\\" (post-exilic) during the 5th century BCE which sometimes makes it difficult to determine whether a given passage is \\"Elohist\\" in origin, or the result of a later editor.\\r\\nThe word Elohim occurs more than 2500 times in the Hebrew Bible, with meanings ranging from \\"gods\\" in a general sense (as in Exodus 12:12, where it describes \\"the gods of Egypt\\"), to specific gods (e.g., 1 Kings 11:33, where it describes Chemosh \\"the god of Moab\\", or the frequent references to Yahweh as the \\"elohim\\" of Israel), to demons, seraphim, and other supernatural beings, to the spirits of the dead brought up at the behest of King Saul in 1 Samuel 28:13, and even to kings and prophets (e.g., Exodus 4:16).[5] The phrase bene elohim, translated \\"sons of the Gods\\", has an exact parallel in Ugaritic and Phoenician texts, referring to the council of the gods.[5]\\r\\nElohim occupy the seventh rank of ten in the famous medieval Rabbinic scholar Maimonides' Jewish angelic hierarchy. Maimonides said: \\"I must premise that every Hebrew [now] knows that the term Elohim is a homonym, and denotes God, angels, judges, and the rulers of countries, ...\\"[2]\\r\\nIn 1 Samuel 28:13, elohim is used with a plural verb. The witch of Endor told Saul that she saw \\"elohim ascending (olim ??????, plural verb) out of the earth.[10]\\r\\nIn Genesis 20:13, Abraham, before the polytheistic Philistine king Abimelech, says that \\"Elohim (translated as God) caused (????, plural verb) me to wander\\".[11][12][13] Whereas the Greek Septuagint (LXX) has a singular verb form (??ϫۚ(), aorist II), most English versions usually translate this as \\"God caused\\" (which does not distinguish between a singular and plural verb).[14]\\r\\nElohim, when meaning the God of Israel, is mostly grammatically singular, and is commonly translated as \\"God\\", and capitalised. For example, in Genesis 1:26, it is written: \\"Then Elohim (translated as God) said (singular verb), 'Let us (plural) make (plural verb) man in our (plural) image, after our (plural) likeness'\\". Wilhelm Gesenius and other Hebrew grammarians traditionally described this as the pluralis excellentiae (plural of excellence), which is similar to the pluralis majestatis (plural of majesty, or \\"Royal we\\").[15]\\r\\nGesenius comments that Elohim singular is to be distinguished from elohim plural gods and remarks that:\\r\\nthe supposition that elohim is to be regarded as merely a remnant of earlier polytheistic views (i.e. as originally only a numerical plural) is at least highly improbable, and, moreover, would not explain the analogous plurals (below). To the same class (and probably formed on the analogy of elohim) belong the plurals kadoshim, meaning \\"the Most Holy\\" (only of Yahweh, Hosea 12:1, Proverbs 9:10, 30:3 - cf. El hiym kadoshim in Joshua 24:19 and the singular Aramaic \\"the Most High\\", Daniel 7:18, 22, 25) and probably teraphim (usually taken in the sense of penates), the image of a god, used especially for obtaining oracles. Certainly in 1 Samuel 19:13, 16 only one image is intended; in most other places a single image may be intended; in Zechariah 10:2 alone is it most naturally taken as a numerical plural.\\r\\nThere are a number of notable exceptions to the rule that Elohim is treated as singular when referring to the God of Israel, including Gen. 20:13, 35:7, 2 Sam. 7:23 and Ps. 58:11, and notably the epithet of the \\"Living God\\" (Deuteronomy 5:26 etc.), which is constructed with the plural adjective, Elohim Hayiym ????? ???? but still takes singular verbs.\\r\\nIn the Septuagint and New Testament translations, Elohim has the singular ? Ĳ?? even in these cases, and modern translations follow suit in giving \\"God\\" in the singular. The Samaritan Torah has edited out some of these exceptions.[16]\\r\\nIn a few cases in the Greek Septuagint (LXX), Hebrew elohim with a plural verb, or with implied plural context, was rendered either angeloi (\\"angels\\") or to kriterion tou Theou (\\"the judgement of God\\").[17] These passages then entered first the Latin Vulgate, then the English King James Version (KJV) as \\"angels\\" and \\"judges\\", respectively. From this came the result that James Strong, for example, listed \\"angels\\" and \\"judges\\" as possible meanings for elohim with a plural verb in his Strong's Concordance, and the same is true of many other 17th-20th century reference works. Both Gesenius' Hebrew Lexicon and the Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon list both angels and judges as possible alternative meanings of elohim with plural verbs and adjectives.\\r\\nThe reliability of the Septuagint translation in this matter has been questioned by Gesenius and Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg. In the case of Gesenius, he lists the meaning without agreeing with it.[18] Hengstenberg stated that the Hebrew Bible text never uses elohim to refer to \\"angels\\", but that the Septuagint translators refused the references to \\"gods\\" in the verses they amended to \\"angels.\\"[19]\\r\\nThe Greek New Testament (NT) quotes Psalm 8:4-6 in Hebrews 2:6b-8a, where the Greek NT has \\"???\\" (angelous) in vs. 7,[20] quoting Ps. 8:5 (8:6 in the LXX), which also has \\"???\\" in a version of the Greek Septuagint.[21] In the KJV, elohim (Strong's number H430) is translated as \\"angels\\" only[22] in Psalm 8:5.\\r\\nThe KJV has elohim translated as \\"judges\\" in Exodus 21:6; Exodus 22:8; and twice in Exodus 22:9.[23]\\r\\nSometimes when elohim occurs as the referent or object (i.e. not subject) of a sentence, and without any accompanying verb or adjective to indicate plurality, it may be grammatically unclear whether gods plural or God singular is intended. An example is Psalm 8:5 where \\"Yet you have made him a little lower than the elohim\\" is ambiguous as to whether \\"lower than the gods\\" or \\"lower than God\\" is intended. The Septuagint read this as \\"gods\\" and then \\"corrected\\" the translation to \\"angels\\",[citation needed] which reading is taken up by the New Testament in Hebrews 2:9 \\"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.\\" (full quote and compare)\\r\\nThe Hebrew language has several nouns with -im (masculine plural) and -oth (feminine plural) endings which nevertheless take singular verbs, adjectives and pronouns. For example, Ba'alim \\"owner\\".\\r\\nIn the following verses Elohim was translated as God singular in the King James Version even though it was accompanied by plural verbs and other plural grammatical terms.\\r\\nAnd there he built an altar and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed [plural verb] himself to him when he fled from his brother.\\r\\nHere the Hebrew verb \\"revealed\\" is plural, hence: \\"the-gods were revealed\\". A NET Bible note claims that the Authorized Version wrongly translates: \\"God appeared unto him\\".[24] This is one of several instances where the Bible uses plural verbs with the name elohim.[25][26]\\r\\nAV Psalm 82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. [...]\\r\\nI have said, Ye [are] gods; and all of you [are] children of the most High.\\r\\nMarti Steussy, in Chalice Introduction to the Old Testament, discusses: The first verse of Psalm 82: Elohim has taken his place in the divine council. Here elohim has a singular verb and clearly refers to God. But in verse 6 of the Psalm, God says to the other members of the council, You [plural] are elohim. Here elohim has to mean gods.[27]\\r\\nMark Smith, referring to this same Psalm, states in God in Translation This psalm presents a scene of the gods meeting together in divine council...Elohim stands in the council of El. Among the elohim he pronounces judgment:...[28]\\r\\nIn Hulsean Lectures for..., H. M. Stephenson discussed Jesus argument in John 10:34ÿ36 concerning Psalm 82. (In answer to the charge of blasphemy Jesus replied:) \\"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?\\" ÿ \\"Now what is the force of this quotation 'I said ye are gods.' It is from the Asaph Psalm which begins 'Elohim hath taken His place in the mighty assembly. In the midst of the Elohim He is judging.'\\"[29]\\r\\nThe Hebrew word for \\"son\\" is ben; plural is bnim (with the construct state form being \\"benei\\"). The Hebrew term benei elohim (\\"sons of God\\" or \\"sons of the gods\\") in Genesis 6:2[30] compares to the use of \\"sons of gods\\" (Ugaritic: b'n il) sons of El in Ugaritic mythology.[31] Karel van der Toorn states that gods can be referred to collectively as bene elim, bene elyon, or bene elohim.[5]\\r\\nIn Jewish tradition, the Torah verse, that was the battle-cry of the Maccabees (Hebrew: ??????, Machabim), \\"Mi chamocha ba'elim YHWH\\" (\\"Who is like You among the heavenly powers, YHWH\\"), is an acronym for \\"Machabi\\" as well as an acronym for \\"Matityahu Kohen ben Yochanan\\". The correlating Torah verse, The song of Moses and the Children of Israel by the Sea, makes a reference to elim, but more with a mundane notion of natural forces, might, war and governmental powers.\\r\\nIn Mormonism, Elohim is a name occasionally used to refer to God the Father. Elohim is a being that is separate from Jesus Christ or \\"the Lord\\" of the Old Testament. Elohim is the physical father of Jesus, whose name before birth is said to have been \\"Jehovah\\".[32]\\r\\nThe Book of Abraham, which members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints hold to be divinely inspired scripture revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith, contains a paraphrase of the first chapter of Genesis which explicitly translates Elohim as the Gods multiple times.","input":"How many times does the word elohim appear in the bible?"},{"output":"33.3 per 1,000 births","context":"Twins are two offspring produced by the same pregnancy.[1] Twins can be either monozygotic (\\"identical\\"), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or dizygotic (\\"fraternal\\"), meaning that they develop from two different eggs. In fraternal twins, each twin is fertilized by its own sperm cell.[2]\\r\\nIn contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a singleton, and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is multiple.[3] Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers.[4]\\r\\nThe human twin birth rate in the United States, rose 76% from 1980 through 2009, from 18.9 to 33.3 per 1,000 births.[5]\\r\\nThe Yoruba peoples have the highest rate of twinning in the world, at 45ÿ50 twin sets (or 90ÿ100 twins) per 1,000 live births,[6][7][8] possibly because of high consumption of a specific type of yam containing a natural phytoestrogen which may stimulate the ovaries to release an egg from each side.[9][10]\\r\\nIn Central Africa there are 18ÿ30 twin sets (or 36ÿ60 twins) per 1,000 live births.[11] In Latin America, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, the lowest rates are found; only 6 to 9 twin sets per 1,000 live births. North America and Europe have intermediate rates of 9 to 16 twin sets per 1,000 live births.[11]\\r\\nMultiple pregnancies are much less likely to carry to full term than single births, with twin pregnancies lasting on average 37 weeks, three weeks less than full term.[12]\\r\\nWomen who have a family history of fraternal twins have a higher chance of producing fraternal twins themselves, as there is a genetically linked tendency to hyper-ovulate. There is no known genetic link for identical twinning.[13] Other factors that increase the odds of having fraternal twins include maternal age, fertility drugs and other fertility treatments, nutrition, and prior births.[14]\\r\\nThe vast majority of twins are either dizygotic (fraternal) or monozygotic (identical). Less common variants are discussed further down the article.\\r\\nTwins can be:\\r\\nAmong non-twin births, male singletons are slightly (about five percent) more common than female singletons. The rates for singletons vary slightly by country. For example, the sex ratio of birth in the US is 1.05 males/female,[15] while it is 1.07 males/female in Italy.[16] However, males are also more susceptible than females to die in utero, and since the death rate in utero is higher for twins, it leads to female twins being more common than male twins.\\r\\nZygosity is the degree of identity in the genome of twins.\\r\\nTOP 10 DIFFERENT TYPES OF TWINS\\r\\nDizygotic (DZ) or fraternal twins (also referred to as \\"non-identical twins\\", \\"dissimilar twins\\", \\"biovular twins\\", and, informally in the case of females, \\"sororal twins\\") usually occur when two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time. When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells, fraternal twins result. The two eggs, or ova, form two zygotes, hence the terms dizygotic and biovular. Fraternal twins are, essentially, two ordinary siblings who happen to be born at the same time, since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, just like ordinary siblings.\\r\\nThis is the most common type of twin.[17]\\r\\nDizygotic twins, like any other siblings, have an extremely small chance of having the same chromosome profile. Even if they happen to have the same chromosome profile, they will always have different genetic material on each chromosome, due to chromosomal crossover during meiosis. Like any other siblings, dizygotic twins may look similar, particularly given that they are the same age. However, dizygotic twins may also look very different from each other.\\r\\nStudies show that there is a genetic proclivity for dizygotic twinning. However, it is only the mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins; there is no known mechanism for a father to cause the release of more than one ovum. Dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in Japan (similar to the rate of monozygotic twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some African countries.[18]\\r\\nDizygotic twins are also more common for older mothers, with twinning rates doubling in mothers over the age of 35.[19] With the advent of technologies and techniques to assist women in getting pregnant, the rate of fraternals has increased markedly.\\r\\nMonozygotic (MZ) or identical twins occur when a single egg is fertilized to form one zygote (hence, \\"monozygotic\\") which then divides into two separate embryos.\\r\\nRegarding spontaneous or natural monozygotic twinning, a recent theory proposes that monozygotic twins are formed after a blastocyst essentially collapses, splitting the progenitor cells (those that contain the body's fundamental genetic material) in half, leaving the same genetic material divided in two on opposite sides of the embryo. Eventually, two separate fetuses develop.[20] Spontaneous division of the zygote into two embryos is not considered to be a hereditary trait, but rather a spontaneous and random event.[19]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins may also be created artificially by embryo splitting. It can be used as an expansion of in vitro fertilization (IVF) to increase the number of available embryos for embryo transfer.[21]\\r\\nMonozygotic twinning occurs in birthing at a rate of about 3 in every 1000 deliveries worldwide.[22] (about 0.6% of the world population).\\r\\nThe likelihood of a single fertilization resulting in monozygotic twins is uniformly distributed in all populations around the world.[19] This is in marked contrast to dizygotic twinning, which ranges from about six per thousand births in Japan (almost similar to the rate of identical twins, which is around 4ÿ5) to 15 and more per thousand in some parts of India[23] and up to over 20 in some Central African countries.[11] The exact cause for the splitting of a zygote or embryo is unknown.\\r\\nIVF techniques are more likely to create dizygotic twins. For IVF deliveries, there are nearly 21 pairs of twins for every 1,000.[24]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins are genetically nearly identical and they are always the same sex unless there has been a mutation during development. The children of monozygotic twins test genetically as half-siblings (or full siblings, if a pair of monozygotic twins reproduces with another pair or with the same person), rather than first cousins. Identical twins do not have the same fingerprints however, because even within the confines of the womb, the fetuses touch different parts of their environment, giving rise to small variations in their corresponding prints and thus making them unique.[25]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins always have different phenotypes. Normally due to an environmental factor or the deactivation of different X chromosomes in female monozygotic twins, and in some extremely rare cases, due to aneuploidy, twins may express different sexual phenotypes, normally from an XXY Klinefelter syndrome zygote splitting unevenly.[26][27][28]\\r\\nMonozygotic twins, although genetically very similar, are not genetically exactly the same. The DNA in white blood cells of 66 pairs of monozygotic twins was analyzed for 506,786 single nucleotide polymorphisms known to occur in human populations. Polymorphisms appeared in 2 of the 33 million comparisons, leading the researchers to extrapolate that the blood cells of monozygotic twins may have on the order of one DNA-sequence difference for every 1.2 x 107 nucleotides, which would imply hundreds of differences across the entire genome.[29] The mutations producing the differences detected in this study would have occurred during embryonic cell-division (after the point of fertilization). If they occur early in fetal development, they will be present in a very large proportion of body cells.\\r\\nAnother cause of difference between monozygotic twins is epigenetic modification, caused by differing environmental influences throughout their lives. Epigenetics refers to the level of activity of any particular gene. A gene may become switched on, switched off, or could become partially switched on or off in an individual. This epigenetic modification is triggered by environmental events. Monozygotic twins can have markedly different epigenetic profiles. A study of 80 pairs of monozygotic twins ranging in age from three to 74 showed that the youngest twins have relatively few epigenetic differences. The number of epigenetic differences increases with age. Fifty-year-old twins had over three times the epigenetic difference of three-year-old twins. Twins who had spent their lives apart (such as those adopted by two different sets of parents at birth) had the greatest difference.[30] However, certain characteristics become more alike as twins age, such as IQ and personality.[31][32][33]\\r\\nA 1981 study of a deceased triploid XXX twin fetus without a heart showed that although its fetal development suggested that it was an identical twin, as it shared a placenta with its healthy twin, tests revealed that it was probably a polar body twin. The authors were unable to predict whether a healthy fetus could result from a polar body twinning.[34]\\r\\nIn 2003, a study argued that many cases of triploidity arise from semi-identical twinning.[35]\\r\\nIn 2007, a study reported a case of a pair of living twins, one intersex and one a phenotypical male. The twins were both found to be chimeras and to share all of their maternal DNA but only half of their father's DNA. The exact mechanism of fertilization could not be determined but the study stated that it was unlikely to be a case of polar body twinning.[36] \\r\\n\\r\\nThe degree of separation of the twins in utero depends on if and when they split into two zygotes. Dizygotic twins were always two zygotes. Monozygotic twins split into two zygotes at some time very early in the pregnancy. The timing of this separation determines the chorionicity (the number of placentae) and amniocity (the number of sacs) of the pregnancy. Dichorionic twins either never divided (i.e.: were dizygotic) or they divided within the first 4 days. Monoamnionic twins divide after the first week.\\r\\nIn very rare cases, twins become conjoined twins. Non-conjoined monozygotic twins form up to day 14 of embryonic development, but when twinning occurs after 14 days, the twins will likely be conjoined.[37] Furthermore, there can be various degrees of shared environment of twins in the womb, potentially leading to pregnancy complications.\\r\\nIt is a common misconception that two placentas means twins are dizygotic. But if monozygotic twins separate early enough, the arrangement of sacs and placentas in utero is indistinguishable from dizygotic twins.\\r\\nDiDi twins have the lowest mortality risk at about 9 percent, although that is still significantly higher than that of singletons.[40]\\r\\nMonochorionic twins generally have two amniotic sacs (called Monochorionic-Diamniotic \\"MoDi\\"), which occurs in 60ÿ70% of the pregnancies with monozygotic twins,[39] and in 0.3% of all pregnancies.[41] Monochorionic-Diamniotic twins are almost always monozygotic, with a few exceptions where the blastocysts have fused.[38]\\r\\nMonochorionic twins share the same placenta, and thus have a risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.\\r\\nMonoamniotic twins are always monozygotic.[42]\\r\\nThe survival rate for monoamniotic twins is somewhere between 50%[42] to 60%.[43]\\r\\nMonoamniotic twins, as with diamniotic monochorionic twins, have a risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Also, the two umbilical cords have an increased chance of being tangled around the babies. Because of this, there is an increased chance that the newborns may be miscarried or suffer from cerebral palsy due to lack of oxygen.\\r\\nWhen the division of the developing zygote into 2 embryos occurs, 99% of the time it is within 8 days of fertilization.\\r\\nMortality is highest for conjoined twins due to the many complications resulting from shared organs.\\r\\nDichorionic-diamniotic twins at 8 weeks and 5 days since co-incubation as part of IVF.

Specifically, the study found that vegan mothers (who exclude dairy from their diets) are one-fifth as likely to have twins as vegetarian or omnivore mothers, and concluded that \\"Genotypes favoring elevated IGF and diets including dairy products, especially in areas where growth hormone is given to cattle, appear to enhance the chances of multiple pregnancies due to ovarian stimulation.\\"[44]\\r\\nFrom 1980 to 1997, the number of twin births in the United States rose 52%.[45] This rise can at least partly be attributed to the increasing popularity of fertility drugs and procedures such as IVF, which result in multiple births more frequently than unassisted fertilizations do. It may also be linked to the increase of growth hormones in food.[44]\\r\\nAbout 1 in 90 human births (1.1%) results from a twin pregnancy.[46] The rate of dizygotic twinning varies greatly among ethnic groups, ranging as high as about 45 per 1000 births (4.5%) for the Yoruba to 10% for Linha S?o Pedro, a tiny Brazilian settlement which belongs to the city of Candido God܇i.[47] In Candido God܇i, one in five pregnancies has resulted in twins.[48] The Argentine historian Jorge Camarasa has put forward a theory that experiments of the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele could be responsible for the high ratio of twins in the area.[49] His theory was rejected by Brazilian scientists who had studied twins living in Linha S?o Pedro; they suggested genetic factors within that community as a more likely explanation.[50] A high twinning rate has also been observed in other places of the world, including:\\r\\nThe widespread use of fertility drugs causing hyperovulation (stimulated release of multiple eggs by the mother) has caused what some call an \\"epidemic of multiple births\\". In 2001, for the first time ever in the US, the twinning rate exceeded 3% of all births. Nevertheless, the rate of monozygotic twins remains at about 1 in 333 across the globe.\\r\\nIn a study on the maternity records of 5750 Hausa women living in the Savannah zone of Nigeria, there were 40 twins and 2 triplets per 1000 births. Twenty-six percent of twins were monozygotic. The incidence of multiple births, which was about five times higher than that observed in any western population, was significantly lower than that of other ethnic groups, who live in the hot and humid climate of the southern part of the country. The incidence of multiple births was related to maternal age but did not bear any association to the climate or prevalence of malaria.[56][57]\\r\\nThe predisposing factors of monozygotic twinning are unknown.\\r\\nDizygotic twin pregnancies are slightly more likely when the following factors are present in the woman:\\r\\nWomen undergoing certain fertility treatments may have a greater chance of dizygotic multiple births. In the United States it has been estimated that by 2011 36% of twin births resulted from conception by assisted reproductive technology.[58]\\r\\nThe risk of twin birth can vary depending on what types of fertility treatments are used. With in vitro fertilisation (IVF), this is primarily due to the insertion of multiple embryos into the uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation without IVF has a very high risk of multiple birth. Reversal of anovulation with clomifene (trade names including Clomid) has a relatively less but yet significant risk of multiple pregnancy.\\r\\nA 15-year German study[59] of 8,220 vaginally delivered twins (that is, 4,110 pregnancies) in Hesse yielded a mean delivery time interval of 13.5 minutes.[60] The delivery interval between the twins was measured as follows:\\r\\nThe study stated that the occurrence of complications \\"was found to be more likely with increasing twin-to-twin delivery time interval\\" and suggested that the interval be kept short, though it noted that the study did not examine causes of complications and did not control for factors such as the level of experience of the obstetrician, the wish of the women giving birth, or the \\"management strategies\\" of the procedure of delivering the second twin.\\r\\nResearchers suspect that as many as 1 in 8 pregnancies start out as multiples, but only a single fetus is brought to full term, because the other fetus has died very early in the pregnancy and has not been detected or recorded.[61] Early obstetric ultrasonography exams sometimes reveal an \\"extra\\" fetus, which fails to develop and instead disintegrates and vanishes in the uterus. There are several reasons for the \\"vanishing\\" fetus, including it being embodied or absorbed by the other fetus, placenta or the mother. This is known as vanishing twin syndrome. Also, in an unknown proportion of cases, two zygotes may fuse soon after fertilization, resulting in a single chimeric embryo, and, later, fetus.\\r\\nConjoined twins (or the once-commonly used term \\"siamese\\") are monozygotic twins whose bodies are joined together during pregnancy. This occurs when the zygote starts to split after day 12[38] following fertilization and fails to separate completely. This condition occurs in about 1 in 50,000 human pregnancies. Most conjoined twins are now evaluated for surgery to attempt to separate them into separate functional bodies. The degree of difficulty rises if a vital organ or structure is shared between twins, such as the brain, heart or liver.\\r\\nA chimera is an ordinary person or animal except that some of their parts actually came from their twin or from the mother. A chimera may arise either from monozygotic twin fetuses (where it would be impossible to detect), or from dizygotic fetuses, which can be identified by chromosomal comparisons from various parts of the body. The number of cells derived from each fetus can vary from one part of the body to another, and often leads to characteristic mosaicism skin coloration in human chimeras. A chimera may be intersex, composed of cells from a male twin and a female twin. In one case DNA tests determined that a woman, mystifyingly, was not the mother of two of her three children; she was found to be a chimera, and the two children were conceived from eggs derived from cells of their mother's twin.[62]\\r\\nSometimes one twin fetus will fail to develop completely and continue to cause problems for its surviving twin. One fetus acts as a parasite towards the other. Sometimes the parasitic twin becomes an almost indistinguishable part of the other, and sometimes this needs to be treated medically.\\r\\nA very rare type of parasitic twinning is one where a single viable twin is endangered when the other zygote becomes cancerous, or molar. This means that the molar zygote's cellular division continues unchecked, resulting in a cancerous growth that overtakes the viable fetus. Typically, this results when one twin has either triploidy or complete paternal uniparental disomy, resulting in little or no fetus and a cancerous, overgrown placenta, resembling a bunch of grapes.\\r\\nOccasionally, a woman will suffer a miscarriage early in pregnancy, yet the pregnancy will continue; one twin was miscarried but the other was able to be carried to term. This occurrence is similar to the vanishing twin syndrome, but typically occurs later, as the twin is not reabsorbed.\\r\\nIt is very common for twins to be born at a low birth weight. More than half of twins are born weighing less than 5.5 pounds (2.5?kg), while the average birth weight of a healthy baby should be around 6ÿ8 pounds (3ÿ4?kg).[63] This is largely due to the fact that twins are typically born premature. Premature birth and low birth weights, especially when under 3.5 pounds (1.6?kg), can increase the risk of several health-related issues, such as vision and hearing loss, mental disabilities, and cerebral palsy.[64] There is an increased possibility of potential complications as the birth weight of the baby decreases.\\r\\nMonozygotic twins who share a placenta can develop twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. This condition means that blood from one twin is being diverted into the other twin. One twin, the 'donor' twin, is small and anemic, the other, the 'recipient' twin, is large and polycythemic. The lives of both twins are endangered by this condition.\\r\\nStillbirths occurs when a fetus dies after 20 weeks of gestation. There are two types of stillbirth, including intrauterine death and intrapartum death. Intrauterine death occurs when a baby dies during late pregnancy. Intrapartum death, which is more common, occurs when a baby dies while the mother is giving birth. The cause of stillbirth is often unknown, but the rate of babies who are stillborn is higher in twins and multiple births. Caesareans or inductions are advised after 38 weeks of pregnancy for twins, because the risk of stillbirth increases after this time.[65]\\r\\nFor otherwise healthy twin pregnancies where both twins are head down a trial of vaginal delivery is recommended at between 37 and 38 weeks.[66][67] Vaginal delivery in this case does not worsen the outcome for the infant as compared with Caesarean section.[66] There is controversy on the best method of delivery where the first twin is head first and the second is not.[66] When the first twin is not head down a caesarean section is often recommended.[66] It is estimated that 75% of twin pregnancies in the United States were delivered by caesarean section in 2008.[68] In comparison, the rate of caesarean section for all pregnancies in the general population varies between 14% and 40%.[69] In twins that share the same placenta delivery may be considered at 36 weeks.[70]\\r\\nTwin studies are utilized in an attempt to determine how much of a particular trait is attributable to either genetics or environmental influence. These studies compare monozygotic and dizygotic twins for medical, genetic, or psychological characteristics to try to isolate genetic influence from epigenetic and environmental influence. Twins that have been separated early in life and raised in separate households are especially sought-after for these studies, which have been used widely in the exploration of human nature. Classical twin studies are now being supplemented with molecular genetic studies which identify individual genes.\\r\\nAmong dizygotic twins, in rare cases, the eggs are fertilized at different times with two or more acts of sexual intercourse, either within one menstrual cycle (superfecundation) or, even more rarely, later on in the pregnancy (superfetation). This can lead to the possibility of a woman carrying fraternal twins with different fathers (that is, half-siblings). This phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation. One 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins, whose parents were involved in paternity suits, was approximately 2.4%; see the references section, below, for more details.\\r\\nDizygotic twins from biracial couples can sometimes be mixed twins, which exhibit differing ethnic and racial features. One such pairing was born in Germany in 2008 to a white father from Germany and a black mother from Ghana.[71][72]\\r\\nHeterotopic pregnancy is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning in which one twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies must be resolved because they can be life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmong monozygotic twins, in extremely rare cases, twins have been born with different sexes (one male, one female).[73] When monozygotic twins are born with different sexes it is because of chromosomal defects. There can be monozygotic boy/girl twins if the sex gene of the embryo has an extra x chromosome (the fertilized egg would be an xxy) then when the egg splits, one can have xx (girl) genes and one can have xy (boy) genes. This is rare, but possible. Records show there are only 10 known cases of these type twins.[citation needed] The probability of this is so small that multiples having different sexes is universally accepted as a sound basis for in utero clinical determination that the multiples are not monozygotic. Another abnormality that can result in monozygotic twins of different genders is if the egg is fertilized by a male sperm but during cell division only the X chromosome is duplicated. This results in one normal male (XY) and one female with Turner syndrome (45,X).[74] In these cases, although the twins did form from the same fertilized egg, it is incorrect to refer to them as genetically identical, since they have different karyotypes.\\r\\nMonozygotic twins can develop differently, due to different genes being activated.[75] More unusual are \\"semi-identical twins\\". These \\"half-identical twins\\" are hypothesized to occur when an unfertilized egg cleaves into two identical attached ova and which are viable for fertilization. Both cloned ova are then fertilized by different sperm and the coalesced eggs undergo further cell duplications developing as a chimeric blastomere. If this blastomere then undergoes a twinning event, two embryos will be formed, each of which have different paternal genes and identical maternal genes.\\r\\nThis results in a set of twins with identical genes from the mother's side, but different genes from the father's side. Cells in each fetus carry genes from either sperm, resulting in chimeras. This form had been speculated until only recently being recorded in western medicine.[76][77][78]\\r\\nMirror image twins result when a fertilized egg splits later in the embryonic stage than normal timing, around day 9ÿ12. This type of twinning could exhibit characteristics with reversed asymmetry, such as opposite dominant handedness, dental structure, or even organs (situs inversus).[79] If the split occurs later than this time period, the twins risk being conjoined. There is no DNA-based zygosity test that can determine if twins are indeed mirror image.[80]\\r\\nThere have been many studies highlighting the development of language in twins compared to single-born children. These studies have converged on the notion that there is a greater rate of delay in language development in twins compared to their single-born counterparts.[81] The reasons for this phenomenon are still in question; however, cryptophasia was thought to be the major cause.[82] Idioglossia is defined as a private language that is usually invented by young children, specifically twins. Another term to describe what some people call \\"twin talk\\" is cryptophasia where a language is developed by twins that only they can understand. The increased focused communication between two twins may isolate them from the social environment surrounding them. Idioglossia has been found to be a rare occurrence and the attention of scientists has shifted away from this idea. However, there are researchers and scientists that say cryptophasia or idioglossia is not a rare phenomenon. Current research is looking into the impacts of a richer social environment for these twins to stimulate their development of language.[83]\\r\\nTwins are common in many animal species, including cats, sheep, ferrets, giant pandas, dogs, deer, marmosets, and tamarins. The incidence of twinning among cattle is about 1ÿ4%, and research is under way to improve the odds of twinning, which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed. A female calf that is the twin of a bull becomes partially masculinized and is known as a freemartin.","input":"What percentage of the population has identical twins?"},{"output":"prefrontal cortex","context":"In mammalian brain anatomy, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is the cerebral cortex which covers the front part of the frontal lobe. The PFC contains Brodmann areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 32, 44, 45, 46, and 47.[1]\\r\\nMany authors have indicated an integral link between a person's will to live, personality, and the functions of the prefrontal cortex.[2] This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior.[3] The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.[4]\\r\\nThe most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social \\"control\\" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).\\r\\nFrontal cortex supports concrete rule learning. More anterior regions along the rostro-caudal axis of frontal cortex support rule learning at higher levels of abstraction.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three possible ways to define the prefrontal cortex:\\r\\nThe prefrontal cortex has been defined based on cytoarchitectonics by the presence of a cortical granular layer IV. It is not entirely clear who first used this criterion. Many of the early cytoarchitectonic researchers restricted the use of the term prefrontal to a much smaller region of cortex including the gyrus rectus and the gyrus rostralis (Campbell, 1905; G. E. Smith, 1907; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). In 1935, however, Jacobsen used the term prefrontal to distinguish granular prefrontal areas from agranular motor and premotor areas.[6] In terms of Brodmann areas, the prefrontal cortex traditionally includes areas 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 32, 44, 45, 46, and 47,[1] however, not all of these areas are strictly granular ÿ 44 is dysgranular, caudal 11 and orbital 47 are agranular.[7] The main problem with this definition is that it works well only in primates but not in nonprimates, as the latter lack a granular layer IV.[8]\\r\\nTo define the prefrontal cortex as the projection zone of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus builds on the work of Rose and Woolsey,[9] who showed that this nucleus projects to anterior and ventral parts of the brain in nonprimates, however, Rose and Woolsey termed this projection zone \\"orbitofrontal.\\" It seems to have been Akert, who, for the first time in 1964, explicitly suggested that this criterion could be used to define homologues of the prefrontal cortex in primates and nonprimates.[10] This allowed the establishment of homologies despite the lack of a granular frontal cortex in nonprimates.\\r\\nThe projection zone definition is still widely accepted today (e.g. Fuster[11]), although its usefulness has been questioned.[7][12] Modern tract tracing studies have shown that projections of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus are not restricted to the granular frontal cortex in primates. As a result, it was suggested to define the prefrontal cortex as the region of cortex that has stronger reciprocal connections with the mediodorsal nucleus than with any other thalamic nucleus.[8] Uylings et al.[8] acknowledge, however, that even with the application of this criterion, it might be rather difficult to define the prefrontal cortex unequivocally.\\r\\nA third definition of the prefrontal cortex is the area of frontal cortex whose electrical stimulation does not lead to observable movements. For example, in 1890 David Ferrier[13] used the term in this sense. One complication with this definition is that the electrically \\"silent\\" frontal cortex includes both granular and non-granular areas.[7]\\r\\nThe table below shows different ways to subdivide parts of the prefrontal cortex based upon Brodmann areas.[1]\\r\\nThe prefrontal cortex is highly interconnected with much of the brain, including extensive connections with other cortical, subcortical and brain stem sites.[14] The dorsal prefrontal cortex is especially interconnected with brain regions involved with attention, cognition and action,[15] while the ventral prefrontal cortex interconnects with brain regions involved with emotion.[16] The prefrontal cortex also receives inputs from the brainstem arousal systems, and its function is particularly dependent on its neurochemical environment.[17] Thus, there is coordination between our state of arousal and our mental state.[18] The interplay between the prefrontal cortex and socioemotional system of the brain is relevant for adolescent development, as proposed by the Dual Systems Model.\\r\\nThe medial prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the generation of slow-wave sleep (SWS), and prefrontal atrophy has been linked to decreases in SWS.[19] Prefrontal atrophy occurs naturally as individuals age, and it has been demonstrated that older adults experience impairments in memory consolidation as their medial prefrontal cortices degrade.[19] In monkeys, significant atrophy has been found as a result of neuroleptic or antipsychotic psychiatric medication.[20] In older adults, instead of being transferred and stored in the neocortex during SWS, memories start to remain in the hippocampus where they were encoded, as evidenced by increased hippocampal activation compared to younger adults during recall tasks, when subjects learned word associations, slept, and then were asked to recall the learned words.[19]\\r\\nThe original studies of Fuster and of Goldman-Rakic emphasized the fundamental ability of the prefrontal cortex to represent information not currently in the environment, and the central role of this function in creating the \\"mental sketch pad\\". Goldman-Rakic spoke of how this representational knowledge was used to intelligently guide thought, action, and emotion, including the inhibition of inappropriate thoughts, distractions, actions, and feelings.[21] In this way, working memory can be seen as fundamental to attention and behavioral inhibition. Fuster speaks of how this prefrontal ability allows the wedding of past to future, allowing both cross-temporal and cross-modal associations in the creation of goal-directed, perception-action cycles.[22] This ability to represent underlies all other higher executive functions.\\r\\nShimamura proposed Dynamic Filtering Theory to describe the role of the prefrontal cortex in executive functions. The prefrontal cortex is presumed to act as a high-level gating or filtering mechanism that enhances goal-directed activations and inhibits irrelevant activations. This filtering mechanism enables executive control at various levels of processing, including selecting, maintaining, updating, and rerouting activations. It has also been used to explain emotional regulation.[23]\\r\\nMiller and Cohen proposed an Integrative Theory of Prefrontal Cortex Function, that arises from the original work of Goldman-Rakic and Fuster. The two theorize that cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represents goals and means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task.[24] In essence, the two theorize that the prefrontal cortex guides the inputs and connections, which allows for cognitive control of our actions.\\r\\nThe prefrontal cortex is of significant importance when top-down processing is needed. Top-down processing by definition is when behavior is guided by internal states or intentions. According to the two, The PFC is critical in situations when the mappings between sensory inputs, thoughts, and actions either are weakly established relative to other existing ones or are rapidly changing.[24] An example of this can be portrayed in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Subjects engaging in this task are instructed to sort cards according to the shape, color, or number of symbols appearing on them. The thought is that any given card can be associated with a number of actions and no single stimulus-response mapping will work. Human subjects with PFC damage are able to sort the card in the initial simple tasks, but unable to do so as the rules of classification change.\\r\\nMiller and Cohen conclude that the implications of their theory can explain how much of a role the PFC has in guiding control of cognitive actions. In the researchers' own words, they claim that, depending on their target of influence, representations in the PFC can function variously as attentional templates, rules, or goals by providing top-down bias signals to other parts of the brain that guide the flow of activity along the pathways needed to perform a task.[24]\\r\\nExperimental data indicate a role for the prefrontal cortex in mediating normal sleep physiology, dreaming and sleep-deprivation phenomena.[25]\\r\\nWhen analyzing and thinking about attributes of other individuals, the medial prefrontal cortex is activated, however, it is not activated when contemplating the characteristics of inanimate objects.[26]\\r\\nStudies using fMRI have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), specifically the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), may modulate mimicry behavior. Neuroscientists are suggesting that social priming influences activity and processing in the amPFC, and that this area of the prefrontal cortex modulates mimicry responses and behavior.[27]\\r\\nAs of recent, researchers have used neuroimaging techniques to find that along with the basal ganglia, the prefrontal cortex is involved with learning exemplars, which is part of the exemplar theory, one of the three main ways our mind categorizes things. The exemplar theory states that we categorize judgements by comparing it to a similar past experience within our stored memories.[28]\\r\\nA 2014 meta-analysis by Professor Nicole P.Yuan from the University of Arizona found that larger prefrontal cortex volume and greater PFC cortical thickness were associated with better executive performance.[29]\\r\\nA widely accepted theory regarding the function of the brain's prefrontal cortex is that it serves as a store of short-term memory. This idea was first formulated by Jacobsen, who reported in 1936 that damage to the primate prefrontal cortex caused short-term memory deficits.[31] Karl Pribram and colleagues (1952) identified the part of the prefrontal cortex responsible for this deficit as area 46, also known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC).[32] More recently, Goldman-Rakic and colleagues (1993) evoked short-term memory loss in localized regions of space by temporary inactivation of portions of the dlPFC.[33] Once the concept of working memory (see also Baddeley's model of working memory) was established in contemporary neuroscience by Baddeley (1986), these neuropsychological findings contributed to the theory that the prefrontal cortex implements working memory and, in some extreme formulations, only working memory.[34] In the 1990s this theory developed a wide following, and it became the predominant theory of PF function, especially for nonhuman primates. The concept of working memory used by proponents of this theory focused mostly on the short-term maintenance of information, and rather less on the manipulation or monitoring of such information or on the use of that information for decisions. Consistent with the idea that the prefrontal cortex functions predominantly in maintenance memory, delay-period activity in the PF has often been interpreted as a memory trace. (The phrase \\"delay-period activity\\" applies to neuronal activity that follows the transient presentation of an instruction cue and persists until a subsequent \\"go\\" or \\"trigger\\" signal.)\\r\\nTo explore alternative interpretations of delay-period activity in the prefrontal cortex, Lebedev et al. (2004) investigated the discharge rates of single prefrontal neurons as monkeys attended to a stimulus marking one location while remembering a different, unmarked location.[30] Both locations served as potential targets of a saccadic eye movement. Although the task made intensive demands on short-term memory, the largest proportion of prefrontal neurons represented attended locations, not remembered ones. These findings showed that short-term memory functions cannot account for all, or even most, delay-period activity in the part of the prefrontal cortex explored. The authors suggested that prefrontal activity during the delay-period contributes more to the process of attentional selection (and selective attention) than to memory storage.\\r\\nIn the last few decades, brain imaging systems have been used to determine brain region volumes and nerve linkages. Several studies have indicated that reduced volume and interconnections of the frontal lobes with other brain regions is observed in patients diagnosed with mental disorders and prescribed potent antipsychotics; those subjected to repeated stressors;[35] suicides;[36] those incarcerated; criminals; sociopaths; those affected by lead poisoning;[37] and daily male cannabis users (only 13 people were tested).[38] It is believed that at least some of the human abilities to feel guilt or remorse, and to interpret reality, are dependent on a well-functioning prefrontal cortex.[39] It is also widely believed that the size and number of connections in the prefrontal cortex relates directly to sentience, as the prefrontal cortex in humans occupies a far larger percentage of the brain than in any other animal. And it is theorized that, as the brain has tripled in size over five million years of human evolution,[40] the prefrontal cortex has increased in size sixfold.[41]\\r\\nA review on executive functions in healthy exercising individuals noted that the left and right halves of the prefrontal cortex, which is divided by the medial longitudinal fissure, appear to become more interconnected in response to consistent aerobic exercise.[42] Two reviews of structural neuroimaging research indicate that marked improvements in prefrontal and hippocampal gray matter volume occur in healthy adults that engage in medium intensity exercise for several months.[43][44]\\r\\nA functional neuroimaging review of meditation-based practices suggested that practicing mindfulness enhances prefrontal activation, which was noted to be correlated with increased well-being and reduced anxiety;[45] however, the review noted the need for cohort studies in future research to better establish this.[45]\\r\\nPerhaps the seminal case in prefrontal cortex function is that of Phineas Gage, whose left frontal lobe was destroyed when a large iron rod was driven through his head in an 1848 accident. The standard presentation (e.g.[46]) is that, although Gage retained normal memory, speech and motor skills, his personality changed radically: He became irritable, quick-tempered, and impatientcharacteristics he did not previously display  so that friends described him as \\"no longer Gage\\"; and, whereas he had previously been a capable and efficient worker, afterward he was unable to complete tasks. However, careful analysis of primary evidence shows that descriptions of Gage's psychological changes are usually exaggerated when held against the description given by Gage's doctor, the most striking feature being that changes described years after Gage's death are far more dramatic than anything reported while he was alive.[47][48]\\r\\nSubsequent studies on patients with prefrontal injuries have shown that the patients verbalized what the most appropriate social responses would be under certain circumstances. Yet, when actually performing, they instead pursued behavior aimed at immediate gratification, despite knowing the longer-term results would be self-defeating.\\r\\nThe interpretation of this data indicates that not only are skills of comparison and understanding of eventual outcomes harbored in the prefrontal cortex but the prefrontal cortex (when functioning correctly) controls the mental option to delay immediate gratification for a better or more rewarding longer-term gratification result. This ability to wait for a reward is one of the key pieces that define optimal executive function of the human brain.\\r\\nThere is much current research devoted to understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in neurological disorders. Many disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and ADHD, have been related to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, and thus this area of the brain offers the potential for new treatments of these conditions.[citation needed] Clinical trials have begun on certain drugs that have been shown to improve prefrontal cortex function, including guanfacine, which acts through the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor. A downstream target of this drug, the HCN channel, is one of the most recent areas of exploration in prefrontal cortex pharmacology.[49]\\r\\nThe term \\"prefrontal\\" as describing a part of the brain appears to have been introduced by Richard Owen in 1868.[6] For him, the prefrontal area was restricted to the anterior-most part of the frontal lobe (approximately corresponding to the frontal pole). It has been hypothesized that his choice of the term was based on the prefrontal bone present in most amphibians and reptiles.[6]\\r\\nAnimation, prefrontal cortex of left cerebral hemisphere (shown in red)\\r\\nFront view\\r\\nLateral view\\r\\nMedial view","input":"What part of the brain controls self image?"},{"output":"In the Heat of the Night","context":"The 40th Academy Awards honored film achievements of 1967.

The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7] Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2 and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February, 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[23]\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.[25]\\r\\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[26]\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[27] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[28] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[28]\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[29]\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[30]\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[31]\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[33]\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[34] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[35] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[36]\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[37][38] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[39] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[40]\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[41] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[42][43] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[44][45]\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[46] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[47]\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[48]\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\" The payloads have already been finalized.[49][50] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[51] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[52] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[53]\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[54] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[55] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[56][needs update] and Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[57][58]\\r\\nIn 2019, a consortium of Vodafone, Audi and PT Scientists are planning a moon landing. The mission is to launch a lander and two small rovers to the moon from Cape Canaveral, Florida on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during the 50th-anniversary year of NASA's Apollo 11 moon landing.[59] Nokia will assist to setup a LTE network in moon to manage lunar terrestrial communication system of the mission.[60]\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[61] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[62] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[63]","input":"How many times have we been to the mon?"},{"output":"Local government","context":"Local government in Australia is the third tier of government in Australia administered by the states and territories, which in turn are beneath the federal tier.[1] Local government is not mentioned in the Constitution of Australia and two referenda in the 1970s and 1980s to alter the Constitution relating to local government were unsuccessful.[2] Every state government recognises local government in their respective constitutions.[3] Unlike Canada, or the United States there is only one level of local government in each state, with no distinction such as cities and counties.\\r\\nThe local governing body is generally referred to as a council, and the territories governed are collectively referred to as \\"local government areas\\"; however, terms such as \\"city\\" or \\"shire\\" also have a geographic interpretation. In August 2016 there were 547 local councils in Australia.[4]\\r\\nDespite the single level of local government in Australia, there are a number of extensive areas with relatively low populations which are not a part of any local government area. Powers of local governments in these areas may be exercised by special purpose bodies established outside of the general legislation, as with Victoria's alpine resorts, or directly by state governments. The area covered by local councils in Australia ranges from as small as 1.5?km2 (0.58?sq?mi) for the Shire of Peppermint Grove in metropolitan Perth, to the Shire of East Pilbara in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which covers 380,000?km2 (150,000?sq?mi), an area larger than Germany or Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLocal government in Australia is subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the states or territories. The functions and practices of local government councils are similar throughout Australia, but may vary to some degree between jurisdictions.\\r\\nThe Australian Capital Territory is not divided into territory and local government.\\r\\nState departments oversee local government councils and may intervene in their affairs, subject to relevant legislation.[5]\\r\\nAs of January 2017[update], the following table provides a summary of local government areas by states and territories by local government area types:\\r\\nThe Australian Classification of Local Governments (ACLG) categorises Australian local governing authorities using the population, the population density and the proportion of the population that is classified as urban for the council.[6] The classification, at the two-digit level, is:\\r\\nThere is no mention of local government in the Constitution of Australia, though it is mentioned several times in the Annotated Constitution of Australia[7][8] namely where \\"Municipal institutions and local government\\" appears in Annotation 447, \\"Power of the Parliament of a Colony\\" under \\"Residuary Legislative Powers\\" on pages 935 and 936.\\r\\nThe first official local government in Australia was the Perth Town Trust, established in 1838, only three years after British settlement.[2] The Adelaide Corporation followed, created by the province of South Australia in October 1840. The City of Melbourne and the Sydney Corporation followed, both in 1842.[2][9] All of these early forms failed; it was not until the 1860s and 1870s that the various colonies established widespread stable forms of local government, mainly for the purpose of raising money to build roads in rural and outer-urban regions. Council representatives attended conventions before Federation, however local government was unquestionably regarded as outside the Constitutional realm.[2]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the Whitlam Government expanded the level of funding to local governments in Australia beyond grants for road construction. General purpose grants become available for the first time.[10]\\r\\nSignificant reforms took place in the 1980s and 1990s in which state governments used metrics and efficiency analysis developed within the private sector in the local government arena. Each state conducted an inquiry into the benefits of council amalgamations during the 1990s.[11] In the early 1990s, Victoria saw the number of local councils reduced from 210 to 78.[11] South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland saw some reductions in the number of local governments while Western Australia and New South Wales rejected compulsory mergers. New South Wales eventually forced the merging of some councils. The main purpose of amalgamating councils was for greater efficiency and to improve operations, but forced amalgamation of councils is sometimes seen as a dilution of representative democracy.[11]\\r\\nAn increase in the range of services offered by councils, but only minor cost savings of less than 10% have been noted by academics as outcomes after mergers. The council mergers have resulted in widespread job losses and lingering resentment from some whose roles have experienced a larger workload.[11]\\r\\nThe growth of the Regional Organisations of Councils has also been a factor in local government reform in Australia.[11] In 1995, there were 50 such agreements across the country. A 2002 study identified 55 ROCs with the largest involving 18 councils.[11]\\r\\nLocal governments are subdivisions of the states and the Northern Territory. The Australian Capital Territory has no separate local governments; and functions in Canberra and the surrounding area normally performed by state and local governments are performed there by the territorial government of the Australian Capital Territory.\\r\\nAlthough they are all essentially identical in function, Australian local governments have a variety of names. The term \\"local government area\\" is used to refer collectively to all local governments regardless of status, whilst the local governing body itself is generally known as a council. Today, the styles \\"borough\\", \\"city\\", \\"district\\", \\"municipality\\", \\"region\\", \\"shire\\", \\"town\\", \\"community government\\", \\"Aboriginal shire\\" and \\"Island\\" are used in addition to areas/councils without a specific style.\\r\\nIn general, an urban or suburban LGA is called a city, as in the City of Canada Bay or City of Bunbury, and is governed by a City Council. A rural LGA covering a larger rural area is usually called a shire, as in Shire of Mornington Peninsula or Lachlan Shire, and is governed by a Shire Council.\\r\\nSometimes words other than \\"City\\" or \\"Shire\\" will be used in the names of LGAs. The word \\"Municipality\\" occurs in some states: in New South Wales, it is typically used for older urban areas and the word is also used for several rural towns in South Australia. Some rural areas in South Australia are known as \\"District Councils\\", while larger rural towns and small metropolitan centres in Queensland and Western Australia simply use the term \\"Town\\". New South Wales and Queensland have introduced a new term, \\"Region\\", for LGAs formed by the amalgamation of smaller shires and rural cities. Historically, the word \\"Borough\\" was common for small towns and metropolitan areas in Victoria, but only the Borough of Queenscliffe remains. In New South Wales, where the Local Government Act does not require a designation, some local governments are legally known simply as \\"Councils\\", such as Port Macquarie-Hastings Council, Inner West Council, or Federation Council. All the LGAs in Tasmania that were previously 'Municipalities' have been renamed 'Councils.'\\r\\nAlmost all local councils have the same administrative functions and similar political structures, regardless of their naming, and retain a particular designation (\\"Shire\\", \\"Borough\\", \\"Town\\", \\"City\\") for historical reasons only. They will typically have an elected council and usually a mayor or shire president responsible for chairing meetings of the council. In some councils, the mayor is a directly elected figure, but in most cases the mayor is elected by their fellow councillors from among their own number. The powers of mayors vary as well. In some states such as Queensland, the mayors have broad executive functions, whereas in New South Wales mayors are essentially ceremonial figureheads who can only exercise power at the discretion of the council.\\r\\nMost of the capital city LGAs administer only the central business districts and nearby central suburbs. A notable exception is the City of Brisbane, the most populous LGA in the country, which administers a significant part of the Brisbane metropolitan area. In most cases, when a city's population statistics are used, it is the statistical division population rather than the local government area.\\r\\nLocal government powers are determined by state governments, and states have primary responsibility for funding and exclusive responsibility for supervision of local councils.\\r\\nLocal government is mentioned in the annotated Australian constitution, as a department of the State Governments, and they are mentioned in the constitutions of each of the six states. A 1988 referendum sought to explicitly insert mention of local government in the federal constitution but this was comprehensively defeated. A further referendum was proposed in 2013, but was cancelled due to the change in the election date.\\r\\nFederal government interaction with local councils happens regularly through the provision of federal grants to help fund local government managed projects.\\r\\nAll local governments are approximately equal in their theoretical powers, although LGAs that encompass large cities such as Brisbane and the Gold Coast command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection and schools are provided by state or territory government rather than by local councils.\\r\\nThe councils' chief responsibility in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges and sewerage.[12] From the 1970s the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal. Child care, tourism and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments' role. These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as \\"rates,\\" and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments. They are caricatured as being concerned only with the \\"three Rs\\": Rates, Roads and Rubbish.\\r\\nHowever, the roles of local government areas in Australia have recently expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier. Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports and pollution control[12] as well as community safety and accessible transport.[5] The changes in services has been described as a shift from 'services to property' towards 'services to people'.[5] Community expectations of local government in Australia has risen in the 21st century partly as a result of wider participation in decision making and transparent management practices.[12]\\r\\nRecent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local subsidiary legislation, in contrast to the previous system of by-laws. Councils also have organised their own representative structures such as Local Government Associations and Regional Organisations of Councils.\\r\\nDoctrines of new public management have shaped state government legislation towards increased freedoms aiming to allow greater flexibility on the part of local governments.[5]\\r\\nUnlike many other countries, Australia has only one level of local government immediately beneath state and territorial governments. Aside from very sparsely populated areas and a few other special cases, almost all of Australia is part of a local government area. Unincorporated areas are often in remote locations, cover vast areas or have very small populations.\\r\\nThe Australian Capital Territory has no municipalities and is in some sense an unincorporated area. The ACT government is directly responsible for matters normally carried out by a local government.\\r\\nNew South Wales has 2 unincorporated areas:\\r\\nIn the Northern Territory, 1.45% of the total area and 4.0% of the population are in unincorporated areas, including Unincorporated Top End Region (Finniss-Mary, the largest), areas covered by the Darwin Rates ActNhulunbuy, Alyangula on Groote Eylandt in the northern region, and Yulara in the southern region.[13]\\r\\nIn South Australia, 60% of the state's area is unincorporated and communities located within receive municipal services provided by a state agency, the Outback Communities Authority.[14]\\r\\nVictoria has 10 unincorporated areas, which are either ski resorts or small islands:[13]\\r\\nWestern Australia has 3 unincorporated areas:","input":"What is the third level of government in australia?"},{"output":"McDonald's Corporation","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nFootnotes?/ references[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue[7], serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries[8] across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016.[9] Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food,[10] the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit.  The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second-largest private employer (behind Walmart) with 1.9 million employees, 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 340732N 1171741W? / ?34.1255N 117.2946W? / 34.1255; -117.2946) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers' business to modernize it. The brothers introduced the \\"Speedee Service System\\" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.[citation needed] The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \\"Speedee\\". In 1962 the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \\"McDonald's\\" with the description \\"Drive-In Restaurant Services\\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, McDonald's, under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logoan overlapping, double-arched \\"M\\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \\"Golden Arches\\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955. This was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall, although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the company's worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum.[12] With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day.[13][14] McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016.[9][13] There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange.[15][16] Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years,[18] making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.[19][20] In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years.[21] In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales.[23][24] McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open.[25][26] This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company currently owns all the land, which is valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated.[citation needed] The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period.[27] In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois.[29][30] In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction.[32] Fast Food Nation also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook.[34] McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure was built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the Oprah Winfrey Show and several other Harpo productions taped) and opened on June 4, 2018.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \\"McDonaldization\\" of society. The Economist newspaper uses the \\"Big Mac Index\\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India[37][38] (albeit for a Maharaja Macthe next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another.[40][41] However, the \\"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014.[42] On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country.[43] On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East[45] looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants.[46] McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCaf on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013.[48] Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.[49][unreliable source?]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nProducts are offered as either \\"eat-in\\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \\"take-out\\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \\"Eat-in\\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \\"Take-out\\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets,[52] replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States and Canada, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's began offering in 2015[55] and 2017[56], respectively, a partial breakfast menu during all hours its restaurants are open.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating.[57] Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \\"McDrive\\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined;[57] it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some countries, \\"McDrive\\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating.[59] In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service.[60] There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \\"Walk-Thru\\" service in place of Drive-Thru.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCaf is a caf-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \\"Macca's\\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993.[62] As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafs located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafs in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit.[57] After upgrading to the new McCaf look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafs worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2015ÿ2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as Shake Shack and Grill'd. It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \\"Create Your Taste\\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10ÿ15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \\"Signature Crafted Recipes\\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores,[64] while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles.[66] The company created a game for the goggles known as \\"Slope Stars.[66]\\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries.[66] In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch.[66] They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.[67][68]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \\"Create Your Taste\\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store opened in Hong Kong in December 2015.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \\"Forever Young\\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.[70][71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \\"sunny\\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \\"semi-swooshes\\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it restricted customers from smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \\"E-Clerks\\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \\"save money on live staffers\\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments.[75] By 2016, McDonald's \\"Create Your Taste\\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 5, 2013, The Guardian revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country.[77] A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages.[79] The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \\"quit complaining\\" as \\"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\\"[80] In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft.[82] In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays.[83] In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour.[84] McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.[85] His total compensation for 2017 was $21,761,052.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00.[87] When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \\"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs.[88] However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.[89][90]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard.[91] The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens.[93][94] The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems.[95] The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games.[98] Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy.[99] To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner.[104] Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and made the annual $50,000 annuity payments for the full 20-year period through 2014, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled What's wrong with McDonald's?, criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \\"McJob\\" was added to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2003.[108] The term was defined as \\"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\\".[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film Super Size Me claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Video Game by Italian group Molleindustria was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \\"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \\"Not bad for a McJob\\".[113] The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s[108] and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book Generation X, has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \\"Would you like a career with that?\\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \\"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\\".[114] In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market,[115] McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States.[116] According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.[118][119]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \\"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\\"[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon.[121] In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \\"clam shell\\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products.[124] 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials.[126] McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.[127]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.[128]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials.[129] For instance, an \\"average meal\\" in the 1970sa Big Mac, fries, and a drinkrequired 46?grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25?grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction.[130] In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving two million pounds (910 tonnes) of packaging annually.[131] Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by twenty-four million pounds (11,000 tonnes) annually.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.[134]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013ÿ14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.[135]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants  rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \\"PR disaster.\\"[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants where Albuquerque, New Mexico, resident Stella Liebeck was initially awarded $2.7 million after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself. The award was later reduced to $640,000.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe  will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.[139]","input":"What is the company name of mcdonald's?"},{"output":"the middle of the 20th century","context":"Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a food prepared by coagulating soy milk and then pressing the resulting curds into soft white blocks. It is a component in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisines.[1] Tofu can be soft, firm, or extra firm. It has a subtle flavor and can be used in savory and sweet dishes. It is often seasoned or marinated to suit the dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu has a low calorie count and relatively large amounts of protein. It is high in iron, and can have a high calcium or magnesium content, depending on the coagulants used in manufacturing (e.g. calcium chloride, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English term \\"tofu\\" comes from Japanese tfu (), borrowed from the original Chinese equivalent ( dufu (pinyin)), literally \\"bean\\" () + \\"curdled\\" or \\"fermented\\" ().[2][3][4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA reference to the word towfu exists in a letter dated 1770 from the English merchant James Flint to American statesman and scientist Benjamin Franklin. This is believed to be the first documented use of the word in English.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"bean curd(s)\\" for tofu has been used in the United States since at least 1840. It is rarely used outside of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu-making was first recorded during the Chinese Han dynasty some 2,000 years ago.[8] Chinese legend ascribes its invention to Prince Liu An (179ÿ122?BC). Tofu and its production technique were introduced to Japan[9][10][11] during the Nara period (710ÿ794). Some scholars believe tofu arrived in Vietnam during the 10th and 11th centuries.[12] It spread to other parts of Southeast Asia as well.[13] This probably coincided with the spread of Buddhism as tofu it is an important source of protein in the vegetarian diet of East Asian Buddhism.[9] Li Shizhen, during the Ming Dynasty, described a method of making tofu in the Compendium of Materia Medica.[14] Since then, tofu has become a staple in many countries, including Vietnam, Thailand, and Korea, with regional variations in production methods, texture, flavor, and usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most commonly held of the three theories of tofu's origin maintains that tofu was discovered by Lord Liu An, a Han Dynasty prince. While plausible, the paucity of reliable sources for this period makes this difficult to conclusively determine. In Chinese history, important inventions were frequently attributed to important leaders and figures of the time.[15] In 1960, a stone mural unearthed from an Eastern Han dynasty tomb provided support for the theory of Han origin of tofu; however some scholars maintain that tofu during the Han dynasty was rudimentary and lacked the firmness and taste for it to be considered as tofu.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother theory suggests that the production method for tofu was discovered accidentally when a slurry of boiled, ground soybeans was mixed with impure sea salt. Such sea salt would probably have contained calcium and magnesium salts, allowing the soy mixture to curdle and produce a tofu-like gel. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe last group of theories maintains that the ancient Chinese learned the method for curdling soy milk by emulating the milk curdling techniques of the Mongolians or East Indians. Despite their advanced culture, no technology or knowledge of culturing and processing milk products existed within ancient Chinese society. (They did not seek such technology, probably because of the Confucian taboo on fermented dairy products and other so-called \\"barbarian foodstuffs\\".)[citation needed] The primary evidence for this theory is the etymological similarity between the Chinese term for Mongolian fermented milk (rufu, which literally means \\"milk curdled\\") and the term doufu (\\"beans curdled\\") or tofu. Although intriguing and possible, there is no evidence to substantiate this theory beyond academic speculation.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA form of tofu may have been discovered during the Han dynasty (220?BC?ÿ AD 220), but it did not become a popular food in China until the Song dynasty (960ÿ1279).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China, tofu is traditionally used as a food offering when visiting the graves of deceased relatives. It is claimed that the spirits (or ghosts) have long lost their chins and jaws, so that only tofu is soft enough for them to eat. Before refrigeration was available in China, tofu was often only sold during winter, since tofu did not spoil as easily in cold weather. During the warmer months, tofu, once made, spoiled if stored for more than a day. Chinese war hero Guan Yu used to be a tofu maker before he enlisted in the army. Chinese martial arts expert and hero Yim Wing-chun was a celebrated tofu maker in her village. (Tofu as such plays a part in a 1994 movie about her life, Wing Chun.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu was introduced to Japan during the Nara period (late 8th century) by Zen Buddhist monks, who initially called it \\"Chinese curd\\" (L, tfu).[5] Much of tofu's early use in Asia was as a vegetarian substitute for meat and fish by Buddhist monks, especially those following Zen Buddhism.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest Japanese document concerning tofu refers to the dish being served as an offering at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara in 1183.[17] The book Tofu Hyakuchin (М Dufu BҊizhn), published in the Edo period, lists 100 recipes for cooking tofu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Southeast Asia, tofu was introduced to the region by Chinese immigrants from Fujian province, as evidenced by many countries in Southeast Asia referring to tofu using the Min Nan Chinese pronunciations for either soft and firm tofu, or \\"tu-h\\" and \\"tu-goan\\" respectively. In Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines, tofu is widely available and used in many local dishes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu is called tahu in Indonesia, and Indonesian dishes such as tahu sumbat, taugeh tahu, asinan, siomay and some curries, often add slices of tofu. Tahu goreng, tahu isi and tahu sumedang are popular fried tofu snacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu is called tauhu in Malaysia and Singapore. Malaysian and Singaporean Indians use tofu in their cuisine, such as in Indian mee goreng, and rojak pasembor. Peranakan cuisine often uses tofu, as in Penang curry noodles and laksa. Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines are major producers of tofu and have plants in many municipalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu in the Philippines is an essential in the daily diet, as taho. It is widely eaten as breakfast, or tokwa (a dry, fried variation), which is a staple alternative to meat in main meals and in numerous regional dishes. Tofu was introduced to the archipelago in the 10th to 13th centuries by Song dynasty Chinese mariners and merchants, along with many other foods that became staples of the Philippine diet. The use and production of tofu were first limited to urban centres with influential Chinese minorities, such as Cebu or Tondo, but quickly spread to even remote native villages and islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBenjamin Franklin was the first American to mention tofu, in a 1770 letter to John Bartram. Franklin, who encountered it during a trip to London, included a few soybeans and referred to it as \\"cheese\\" from China.[18] In 1770 Franklin also corresponded with James Flint on the subject of how the Chinese converted callivances (soybeans) into tofu. This is believed to be the first use of the word \\"tofu\\" in the English language.[19] The first tofu company in the United States was established in 1878.[20] In 1908 Li Yuying, a Chinese anarchist and a vegetarian with a French degree in agriculture and biology, opened a soy factory, the Usine de la Caso-Soja?ne. This was the world's first soy dairy and the first factory in France to manufacture and sell beancurd.[21] However, tofu was not well known to most Westerners before the middle of the 20th century. With increased cultural contact between the West and East Asia and growing interest in vegetarianism, knowledge of tofu has become widespread. Numerous types of pre-flavored tofu can be found in supermarket chains throughout the West. It is also used by many vegans and vegetarians as a source of protein.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegardless of the product or scale of the production, the production of tofu essentially consists of\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is similar to the production of dairy cheese by coagulating the milk of dairy animals to form curds and pressing and aging the curds to form cheese. Typical tofu making procedures are cleaning, soaking, grinding beans in water, filtering, boiling, coagulation, and pressing.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoagulation of the protein and oil (emulsion) suspended in the boiled soymilk is the most important step in the production of tofu. This process is accomplished with the aid of coagulants. Coagulation of the soymilk is the most important step in tofu making process but is complicated as the process depends on complex interactions. There are many variables including the variety and percentage of protein in the soybeans used, slurry cooking temperature, coagulation temperature, and other factors.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo types of coagulants (salts and acids) are used commercially.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporary tofu manufacturers may choose to use one or more of these coagulants, since each plays a role in producing a desired texture in the finished tofu.[28] Different textures result from different pore sizes and other microscopic features in the tofu produced using each coagulant. The coagulant mixture is dissolved in water, and the solution is then stirred into boiled soymilk until the mixture curdles into a soft gel.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCoagulants are typically added at concentrations between 1.5 and 5.0 g/kg. In all coagulants consisting of calcium or magnesium salts, the positive double bonded ions of the calcium or magnesium are responsible for the coagulation of the soy proteins which become part of the tofu, thereby enhancing its nutritional value. Only 1 part per 1000 of the tofu eaten is coagulant; most of the coagulant reacts with soy protein and is broken down into ions. The non-reactive portion dissolves in the whey and is discarded.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe curds are processed differently depending on the form of tofu that is being manufactured. For soft silken tofu (; nn dufu) or tofu pudding (, duhu OR , dufuhu) the soymilk is curdled directly in the tofu's final packaging. For standard firm Asian tofu, the soy curd is cut and strained of excess liquid using cheese cloth or muslin and then lightly pressed to produce a soft cake. Firmer tofus, such as Asian dry tofu (a) or Western types of tofu, are further pressed to remove even more liquid. In Vietnam, the curd is strained and molded in a square mold, and the end product is called ??u khu?n (molded bean) or ??u ph? (one of the Vietnamese ways to pronounce the Chinese dufu). The tofu curds are allowed to cool and become firm. The finished tofu can then be cut into pieces, flavored or further processed.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough tartness is sometimes desired in dessert tofu, the acid used in flavoring is usually not the primary coagulant, since concentrations sufficiently high to induce coagulation negatively affect the flavor or texture of the resulting tofu. A sour taste in tofu and a slight cloudiness in its storing liquid is also usually an indication of bacterial growth and, hence, spoilage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whiteness of tofu is ultimately determined by the soybean variety, soybean protein composition and degree of aggregation of the tofu gel network. The yellowish beige color of soybeans is due to the color compounds including anthocyanin, isoflavones and polyphenol compounds; therefore the soybean variety used will predicate the color of the final tofu product.[33] Ways to reduce the yellow color include reducing isoflavone content by changing the pH of the soymilk solution used in the production of the tofu so that the relevant compounds precipitate out and are removed during the extraction of okara.[34] The opacity of tofu gel and the off-white color typical of standard uncooked firm tofu is due to the scattering of light by the colloidal particles of the tofu. The addition of higher levels of calcium salts or a high protein content will contribute to forming a denser and more aggregated gel network which disperses more light, resulting in a tofu with a whiter appearance.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu flavor is generally described as bland, which is the taste desired by customers in North America. A more beany flavor is preferred in East Asia. The beany or bland taste is generated during the grinding and cooking process, and either a \\"hot grind\\" or a \\"cold grind\\" can be used to influence the taste. The hot grind method reduces the beany flavor due to the inactivation of the lipoxygenase enzyme in the soy protein that is known to generate off flavors, which makes a tofu that is \\"bland\\". If a cold grind is used the enzyme is still present and produces the aldehyde, alcohol and ester volatile compounds that create beany notes.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nA wide variety of types and flavours of tofu is available in both Western and Eastern markets. Despite the range of options, tofu products can be split into two main categories: 'fresh tofu', which is produced directly from soy milk, and 'processed tofu', which is produced from fresh tofu. Tofu production also creates important by-products that are used in various cuisines.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the amount of water that is extracted from the tofu curds, fresh tofu can be divided into four main varieties: extra soft, soft (or silken), firm, and extra firm. Fresh tofu is usually sold completely immersed in water to maintain its moisture content and freshness, and to retard bacterial growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtra soft tofu is called sun-dubu (???; \\"mild tofu\\") in Korean. Soy milk is mixed with seawater, or saline water made with sea salt, so that it curdles.[36][37] The curds remain loose and soft. Freshly made sun-dubu is eaten boiled with little or no seasoning. Manufactured sundubu is usually sold in tubes. It is also the main ingredient in sundubu-jjigae (?????; \\"soft tofu stew\\"). Although the word sun in sun-dubu doesn't have a Sino-Korean origin,[38] sun-dubu is often translated into Chinese and Japanese using the Chinese character ?, whose Korean pronunciation is sun and the meaning is \\"pure\\". Thus in China, sun-dubu is called ch~n dufu (?; \\"pure tofu\\"), and in Japan, it is called jun-tfu (?) or sundubu (Ƥ).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn China, extra soft tofu called douhua (dau fa (Cantonese), tau hua (Fujianese) (; \\"tofu flower\\")) is frequently served at breakfast or for dessert. It is usually served either with a sweet ginger syrup, or a mushroom gravy called da lu (). It's normally coagulated at the restaurant into a serving container. Many home cooks coagulate it with agar.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoft tofu, also known as \\"silken tofu\\", is called nn dufu (; \\"soft tofu\\") or hu dufu (c, \\"smooth tofu\\") in Chinese; kinugoshi tfu (?; \\"silk-filtered tofu\\") in Japanese; and yeon-dubu (???; ?; \\"soft tofu\\") in Korean. It is undrained, unpressed tofu that contains a high moisture content.[39] Silken tofu is produced by coagulating soy milk without curdling it.[40][41] Silken tofu is available in several consistencies, including soft and firm, but all silken tofu is more delicate than regular firm tofu (pressed tofu) and it has different culinary uses.[42] In Japan and Korea, traditional soft tofu is made with seawater.[43][44][45][46][47] Silken tofu is used as a substitute for dairy products and eggs, especially for smoothies and baked desserts.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDouhua (, duhu or , dufuhu in Chinese), or tofu brain ( or e, dufuna in Chinese) is often eaten as a dessert, but sometimes salty pickles or hot sauce are added. This is a type of soft tofu with an very high moisture content. Because it is difficult to pick up with chopsticks, it is generally eaten with a spoon. With the addition of flavorings such as finely chopped spring onions, dried shrimp, soy sauce or chilli sauce, douhua is a popular breakfast dish across China. In Malaysia, douhua is usually served warm with white or dark palm sugar syrup, or served cold with longans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome variation exists among soft tofus. Black douhua (D, hiduhu) is a type of silken tofu made from black soybeans, which is usually made into duhu () rather than firm or dry tofu. The texture of black bean tofu is slightly more gelatinous than regular douhua and the color is greyish in tone. This type of tofu is eaten for its earthy \\"black bean taste\\". Edamame tofu is a Japanese variety of kinugoshi tfu made from edamame (fresh green soybeans); it is pale green in color and often studded with whole edamame.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirm tofu (called ] lҊo dufu in Chinese; J, momen-dfu in Japanese, \\"cotton tofu\\"; ???, mo-dubu in Korean): Although drained and pressed, this form of fresh tofu retains a high moisture content. It has the firmness of raw meat and bounces back readily when pressed. The texture of the inside of the tofu is similar to that of a firm custard. The skin of this form of tofu retains the pattern of the muslin used to drain it and the outside is slightly more resistant to damage than the inside. It can be picked up easily with chopsticks.[39][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nA very firm type of momen-dfu is eaten in parts of Japan, called ishi-dfu (f, \\"stone tofu\\") in parts of Ishikawa, or iwa-dfu (, \\"rock tofu\\") in Gokayama in the Toyama Prefecture and in Iya in the prefecture of Tokushima. These types of firm tofu are produced with seawater instead of nigari (magnesium chloride), or using concentrated soy milk. Some of them are squeezed using heavy weights to eliminate excess moisture. These products are produced in areas where travelling is inconvenient, such as remote islands, mountain villages, and heavy snowfall areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nDu gn (a, literally \\"dry tofu\\" in Chinese) or su ji (\\\\z, vegetarian chicken) is an extra firm variety of tofu where a large proportion of the liquid has been pressed out. Du gn contains the least amount of moisture of all fresh tofu and has the firmness of fully cooked meat and a somewhat rubbery feel similar to that of paneer. When sliced thinly this tofu can be crumbled easily. The skin of this form of tofu has the pattern of the muslin used to drain and press it. Western firm tofu is milled and reformed after pressing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSu ji is a more common type of unflavored, extra-firm tofu. It cannot be crumbled and has a more rubbery texture. One variety of dried tofu is pressed especially flat and sliced into long strings with a cross section smaller than 2?mm G 2?mm. Shredded dried tofu (a, dugnsؐ in Chinese, or simply a, gnsؐ), which looks like loose cooked noodles, can be served cold, stir-fried, or added to soup, as with Japanese aburaage.[15][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany forms of processed tofu exist. Some processing techniques probably[citation needed] originate before the days of refrigeration from the need to preserve tofu, or to increase its shelf life. Other production techniques are employed to create tofus with different textures and flavors.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring freezing, the ice crystals puncture cell walls and facilitate the release of free and bound water and cause a decrease in total water content in tofu after freezing then thawing. The initial protein-water bonds are irreversibly replaced by protein-protein bonds, which are more elastic which cause a structural change to the gel network and lead to an increase in textural properties such as hardness, springiness, cohesiveness and gumminess.[52][53]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo kinds of freeze-dried tofu are produced in Japan. They are usually rehydrated by being soaked in water prior to consumption. In their dehydrated state they do not require refrigeration.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu skin is produced when soy milk is boiled in an open, shallow pan, thus producing a film or skin composed primarily of a soy protein-lipid complex on the liquid surface. The films are collected and dried into yellowish sheets known as \\"soy milk skin\\" (, fѸp in Chinese; ?~, yuba in Japanese). Its approximate composition is: 50ÿ55% protein, 24ÿ26% lipids (fat), 12% carbohydrate, 3% ash, and 9% moisture.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skin can also be dried into a product known as \\"tofu bamboo\\" (G, fѸ zh~ in Chinese; ph tr~c in Vietnamese; kusatake, Japanese), or into many other shapes. Since tofu skin has a soft yet rubbery texture, it can be folded or shaped into different forms and cooked further to imitate meat in vegan cuisine. Some factories dedicate their production to tofu skin and other soy membrane products. Tofu skin is commonly sold in the form of dried leaves or sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nOkara (from the Japanese, ƾ, okara; known as , xuhuci, in Chinese, lit. \\"snowflake vegetable\\"; , dufuzh, also Chinese, lit. \\"tofu sediment/residue\\"; and ???, kongbiji, in Korean), is a tofu by-product sometimes known in the west as \\"soy pulp\\" or \\"tofu lees\\",[56] consisting of the fiber, protein, and starch left over when soy milk has been extracted from ground soaked soybeans.[57] It is mainly used as animal feed in most tofu producing cultures, but is sometimes used in Japanese and Korean cuisines, such as in the Korean stew kongbiji jjigae (?????). It is also an ingredient for vegetarian burgers in many Western nations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term tofu is used by extension for similarly textured curdled dishes that do not use soy products, such as \\"almond tofu\\" (almond jelly), tamago-dfu?(ja) (egg), goma-dfu?(ja) (sesame), or peanut tofu (Chinese  luhushng dufu and Okinawan jؐmmi-dfu?(ja)).\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to their Asian origins and their textures, many food items are called \\"tofu\\", even though their production processes are not technically similar. For instance, many sweet almond tofus are actually gelatinous desserts hardened using agar or gelatin. Some foods, such as Burmese tofu, are not coagulated from the \\"milk\\" of the legume but rather set in a manner similar to soft polenta, Korean muk, or the jidou liangfen of Yunnan province of southwest China.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Almond tofu\\" (Chinese: پ?o? xngrn dufu; Japanese: annindfu) is a milky white and gelatinous substance resembling tofu, but it does not use soy products or soy milk and is hardened with agar. A similar dessert made with coconut milk or mango juices may occasionally be referred to as \\"coconut tofu\\" or \\"mango tofu\\", although such names are also given to hot dishes that use soy tofu and coconut or mango in the recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBurmese tofu (to hpu in Burmese) is a legume product made from besan (chana dal) flour; the Shan variety uses yellow split pea flour instead. Both types are yellow in color and generally found only in Myanmar, though the Burman variety is also available in some overseas restaurants serving Burmese cuisine.[58] Burmese tofu may be fried as fritters cut into rectangular or triangular shapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety called hsan to hpu (or hsan ta hpo in Shan regions) is made from rice flour (called hsan hmont or mont hmont) and is white in color with the same consistency as yellow Burmese tofu when set. It is eaten as a salad in the same manner as yellow tofu.\\r\\n\\r\\nEgg tofu?(ja) (Japanese: ޔb, P, tamagodfu) (Chinese: , dn dufu; often called ?Y侤?, rb?n dufu, lit. \\"Japan bean curd\\") is the main type of savory flavored tofu. Whole beaten eggs are combined with dashi, poured into molds, and cooked in a steamer (cf. chawanmushi). This tofu has a pale golden color that can be attributed to the addition of eggs and, occasionally, food coloring. This tofu has a fuller texture and flavor than silken tofu, due to the presence of egg fat and proteins. Plain \\"dried tofu\\" can be flavored by stewing in soy sauce (?F) to make soy-sauce tofu. It is common to see tofu sold from hot food stalls in this soy-sauce stewed form. Today Japanese tofu is made of eggs, water, vegetable protein, and seasoning.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese tofu was invented in Japan during the Edo period. The booḳZٛgwritten in 1785 recorded how to make Japanese tofu. Later the Japanese form of tofu entered Southeast Asia, being introduced to China in 1995 from Malaysia. At first, Japanese tofu was only provided in upscale restaurants. As time went by, more Chinese could afford Japanese tofu, and it became a comman dish.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\n100 grams of Japanese tofu has 17?mg calcium, 24?mg magnesium, and 5?mg protein while 100 grams tofu has 138?mg calcium, 63?mg magnesium and 12.2?mg protein. Compared with tofu, Japanese tofus nutritional value is lower.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu dihses common in Japan include: three delicacies Japanese tofu; shrimp Japanese tofu; Japanese tofu in ketchup; teppanyaki Japanese tofu; and Japanese fish-flavored tofu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Okinawa, Japan, jؐmmi-dfu?(ja) a peanut milk, made by crushing raw peanuts, adding water and straining, is combined with starch (usually sweet potato, known locally as umukuji or umukashi (Q?v?)) and heated until curdling occurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese equivalent is  luhushng dufu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tofu known as goma-dfu?(ja) is made by grinding sesame into a smooth paste, combining it with liquid and kudzu starch, and heating it until curdling occurs. It is often served chilled as hiyayakko.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu has very little flavor or smell of its own. Consequently, tofu can be used in both savory or sweet dishes, acting as a bland background for presenting the flavors of the other ingredients used. In order to flavor the tofu it is often marinated in soy sauce, chillis, sesame oil, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Asian cooking, tofu is prepared in many ways, including raw, stewed, stir-fried, in soup, cooked in sauce, or stuffed with fillings. The idea of using tofu as a meat substitute is not common in East Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Chinese tofu dishes such as jichng dufu (ģ) and mp܇ duf~ (^) include meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chinese cuisine, Duhu () is served with toppings such as boiled peanuts, azuki beans, cooked oatmeal, tapioca, mung beans, or a syrup flavored with ginger or almond. During the summer, \\"duhu\\" is served with crushed ice; in the winter, it is served warm.[62]\\r\\nIn many parts of China, fresh tofu is eaten with soy sauce or further flavored with katsuobushi shavings, century eggs ( pdn), and sesame seed oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the exception of the softest tofus, all forms of tofu can be fried. Thin and soft varieties of tofu are deep fried in oil until they are light and airy in their core ߊ dupo, ߊ dufupo, S y܇udufu, or  dubѸ in Chinese, literally \\"bean bubble,\\" describing the shape of the fried tofu as a bubble.\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the type of tofu used, the texture of deep fried tofu may range from crispy on the outside and custardy on the inside, to puffed up like a plain doughnut. The former is usually eaten plain in Chinese cuisine with garlic soy sauce, while the latter is either stuffed with fish paste to make Yong Tau Foo or cooked in soups.[62] In Taiwan, fried tofu is made into a dish called \\"A-gei\\", which consists of a fried aburage tofu package stuffed with noodles and capped with surimi.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofus such as firm Asian and du gn (Chinese dry tofu), with their lower moisture content, are cut into bite-sized cubes or triangles and deep fried until they develop a golden-brown, crispy surface ( in Chinese, zhdufu, lit. \\"fried tofu\\"). These may be eaten on their own or with a light sauce, or further cooked in liquids; they are also added to hot pot dishes or included as part of the vegetarian dish called luohan zhai.\\r\\n\\r\\nA spicy Sichuan preparation using firm Asian tofu is mp܇ dufu (^). It involves braised tofu in a beef, chili, and fermented bean paste sauce. A vegetarian version is known as ml dufu (^).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nDried tofu is usually not eaten raw but first stewed in a mixture of soy sauce and spices.[citation needed] Some types of dried tofu are pre-seasoned with special blends of spices, so that the tofu may either be called \\"five-spice tofu\\" (e wѸxing dufu) or \\"soy sauce stewed tofu\\" (?ui lѸshu dufu). Dried tofu is typically served thinly sliced with chopped green onions or with slices of meat for added flavor.[dubious  ÿ discuss][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu bamboos are often used in lamb stew or in a dessert soup. Tofu skins are often used as wrappers in dim sum.[citation needed] Freeze-dried tofu and frozen tofu are rehydrated and enjoyed in savory soups. These products are often taken along on camping trips since a small bag of them can provide protein for many days.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPickled tofu is commonly used in small amounts together with its soaking liquid to flavor stir-fried or braised vegetable dishes (particularly leafy green vegetables such as water spinach). It is often eaten directly as a condiment with rice or congee.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese soft tofu dish, pidan doufu\\r\\n\\r\\nPrepared dried tofu threads (a, gnsؐ\\r\\n\\r\\nchu dufu is a very pungent type of tofu\\r\\n\\r\\nSichuan-style (m l chu dufu) numbing spicy stinky tofu\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu and potatoes grilled at a street stall in Yuanyang, Yunnan province, China\\r\\n\\r\\nDouhua (), is a soft tofu dish.  The fresh tofu is served warm and dressed with sweet syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Indonesia, tofu is called tahu. In Indonesian markets tofu is usually available in two forms: tahu putih or common white firm tofu; and tahu goreng or fried tofu that has developed a brown skin. Tahu yun yi or tahu Bandung is yellow tofu colored with turmeric.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common cooking technique in many parts of East and Southeast Asia involves deep frying tofu in vegetable oil, sunflower oil, or canola oil. In Indonesia, it is usually fried in palm oil. Although pre-fried tofu is often sold cold, it is seldom eaten directly and requires additional cooking. \\r\\n\\r\\nPopular Indonesian tofu dishes includes tahu gejrot and kupat tahu. tahu gejrot is tahu pong type of hollow fried tofu cut into small pieces, served with a thin, watery dressing made by blending palm sugar, vinegar and sweet soy sauce, garnished with chili pepper, garlic and shallot.  Kupat tahu is slices of tofu served with ketupat rice cake, usually in peanut sauce dressing. Slices of tofu usually mixed in gado-gado, ketoprak and siomay.\\r\\n\\r\\nBacem is a method of cooking tofu originating in Central Java. The tofu is boiled in coconut water, mixed with lengkuas (galangal), Indonesian bay leaves, coriander, shallot, garlic, tamarind and palm sugar. After the spicy coconut water has completely evaporated, the tofu is fried until it is golden brown. The result is moist but rather firm, sweet and spicy tofu. This cooked tofu variant is commonly known as tahu bacem in Indonesian.

In the winter, tofu is frequently eaten as yudofu, which is simmered in a clay pot in kombu dashi, with vegetables such as Chinese cabbage or green onion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeep fried tofu is called atsuage (G?P) or namaage (?P) in Japan. The thinner variety, called aburaage (S?P), develops a tofu pouch often used for inari-sushi.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japan, cubes of lightly coated and fried tofu topped with a kombu dashi-based sauce are called agedashi-dofu (?P͵). Soft tofu that has been thinly sliced and deep fried, known as aburage in Japan, is commonly blanched, seasoned with soy sauce and mirin and served in dishes such as kitsune udon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoft tofu can also be broken up or mashed and mixed with raw ingredients prior to being cooked. For example, Japanese ganmodoki is a mixture of chopped vegetables and mashed tofu. The mixture is bound together with starch and deep fried. Chinese families sometimes make a steamed meatloaf or meatball dish from equal parts of coarsely mashed tofu and ground pork.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese miso soup is frequently made with tofu.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese-style silken tofu with soy sauce and a decorative carrot slice\\r\\n\\r\\nAtsuage, thick fried tofu\\r\\n\\r\\nGoma tofu, made from sesame seeds and kudzu starch\\r\\n\\r\\nYudofu, or tofu in hot water\\r\\n\\r\\nInarizushi, tofu skin with various fillings\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu in miso soup\\r\\n\\r\\nGanmodoki ()\\r\\n\\r\\nDubu plays an important part in Korean cuisine.[63] Tofu is often pan-fried and served as banchan with a dipping sauce.[64] Cubes of firm tofu can be seasoned with soy sauce, garlic, and other ingredients before pan-frying. A dish of tofu cubes simmered with similar spicy seasoning is called dubu-jorim.[65] Dubu-kimchi features blanched tofu served in rectangular slices around the edges of a plate with pan-fried kimchi. This is a popular food to accompany alcoholic drinks (anju).[66] Soft, unpressed sun-dubu is used as the main ingredient of sundubu-jjigae (soft tofu stew),[67] while other soups and stews such as doenjang-guk (soybean paste soup), doenjang-jjigae (soybean paste stew), and kimchi-jjigae (kimchi stew) tend to have diced firm tofu in them.

The Malaysian and Singaporean version of taho or douhua is called tofufa\\" or \\"taufufa. Warm soft tofu is served in slices (created by scooping it from a wooden bucket with a flat spoon) in a bowl with either pandan-flavored sugar syrup or palm sugar syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Vietnam, duhu, pronounced ??u h?, is a variety of soft tofu made and carried around in an earthenware jar. It is served by being scooped into a bowl with a very shallow and flat spoon, and it is eaten hot together with either powdered sugar and lime juice or a ginger-flavored syrup.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, the firmer styles of tofu are used for kebabs, mock meats, and dishes requiring a consistency that holds together, while the softer styles can be used for desserts, soups, shakes, and sauces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirm Western tofu types can be barbecued, since they hold together on a barbecue grill. These types are usually marinated overnight as the marinade does not easily penetrate the entire block of tofu. (Techniques to increase the penetration of marinades include stabbing repeatedly with a fork or freezing and thawing prior to marinating.) Grated firm Western tofu is sometimes used in conjunction with textured vegetable protein (TVP) as a meat substitute. Softer tofus are sometimes used as a dairy-free or low-calorie filler. Silken tofu may be used to replace cheese in certain dishes, such as lasagna.[68] Tofu has also been fused into other cuisines in the West, for instance in Indian-style curries.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu and soy protein can be industrially processed to match the textures and flavors of cheese, pudding, eggs, bacon, and similar products. Tofu's texture can also be altered by freezing, pureing, and cooking. In the Americas, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, tofu is frequently associated with vegetarianism and veganism, as it is a source of non-animal protein.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn India tofu is used as a low-fat replacement for paneer, providing the same texture with a similar taste.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu is relatively high in protein, about 10.7% for firm tofu and 5.3% for soft \\"silken\\" tofu, with about 5% and 2% fat, respectively,[70] as a percentage of weight.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, a report from the University of Kentucky, financed by Solae, concluded that soy protein is correlated with significant decreases in serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, LDL, (\\"bad cholesterol\\") and triglyceride concentrations.[72] However, high density lipoprotein HDL (good cholesterol) did not increase. Soy phytoestrogens (isoflavones: genistein and daidzein) absorbed onto the soy protein were suggested as the agent reducing serum cholesterol levels. On the basis of this research, PTI, in 1998, filed a petition with the Food and Drug Administration for a health claim that soy protein may reduce cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FDA granted this health claim for soy: \\"25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease\\".[73] For reference, 100?grams of firm tofu coagulated with calcium sulfate contains 8.19?grams of soy protein.[74] In January 2006 an American Heart Association review (in the journal Circulation) of a decade-long study of soy protein benefits showed only a minimal decrease in cholesterol levels, but it compared favorably against animal protein sources.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause it is made of soy, individuals with allergies to legumes should not consume tofu.\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu is considered a cooling agent in traditional Chinese medicine. It is claimed to invigorate the spleen, replenish qi, moisten and cool off yang vacuity, and detoxify the body.[76] However, there is no scientific evidence supporting such claims, nor their implied notions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Chinese traditional medicine, tofu is considered suitable for those who are weak, malnourished, deficient in blood and qi; for the elderly; for the slim; for those with high fat content in theirblood, high cholesterol, overweight, and with hardened blood vessels; for people with diabetes; for mothers with low breast-milk supply; for children and young adults; for those with an inflamed respiratory tract, phlegm, bad coughs or asthma. Tofu is also considered suitable for elderly people; it is recommended that it be eaten together with liquor, since tofu contains cysteine, which can speed up the detoxification of alcohol in the body and lessen the harm done to the liver.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu is made from soymilk which is a turbid colloidal liquid/solution. Turbid means a cloudy opaque or thick liquid with suspended matter. A colloid solution is a solution in which a material is evenly suspended in a liquid, more specifically, a non homogeneous mixture, in which one substance of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Tofu structure is related to soymilk components, particularly colloid components such as protein particles and oil globules. Protein particles content increases with the increase of the globulin ratio in the soybeans. Tofu varieties ensue from adding coagulants at various concentrations.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two main components of the soybean important in tofu making are the 11S component, containing glycinin and the 7S subunit, containing hemagglutinins, lipoxygenases, b-amylase, and -conglycinin. The major soy protein components, in the two fractions that make up 65ÿ85% of the proteins in soybeans, include glycinin and -conglycinin. The soybean protein consists of many different subunits which are sensitive to heat, pH and ionic strength and become unevenly distributed among soluble and particulate fractions due to hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction because of the amino acid composition.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTofu in a market ready for sale.

Hawley and was signed into law on June 17, 1930. The act raised U.S. tariffs on over 20,000 imported goods.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tariffs (this does not include duty-free imports ÿ see Tariff levels below) under the act were the second-highest in the U.S. in 100 years, exceeded by a small margin by the Tariff of 1828.[3] The Act and following retaliatory tariffs by America's trading partners were major factors of the reduction of American exports and imports by more than half during  the Depression.[4] Although economists disagree by how much, the consensus view among economists and economic historians is that \\"The passage of the SmootÿHawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression.\\"[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, Congress passed the FordneyÿMcCumber Tariff act which increased tariffs on imports.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe League of Nations' World Economic Conference met at Geneva in 1927, concluding in its final report: \\"the time has come to put an end to tariffs, and to move in the opposite direction.\\" Vast debts and reparations could only be repaid through gold, services or goods; but the only items available on that scale were goods. However, many of the delegates' governments did the opposite, starting in 1928 when France passed a new tariff law and quota system.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the late 1920s the economy of the United States had made exceptional gains in productivity due to electrification, which was a critical factor in mass production. Horses and mules had been replaced by motorcars, trucks and tractors. One-sixth to one-quarter of farmland, previously devoted to feeding horses and mules, was freed up, contributing to a surplus in farm produce. Although nominal and real wages had increased, they did not keep up with the productivity gains. As a result, the ability to produce exceeded market demand, a condition that was variously termed overproduction and underconsumption. Senator Smoot contended that raising the tariff on imports would alleviate the overproduction problem; however, the US had actually been running a trade account surplus, and although manufactured goods imports were rising, manufactured exports were rising even faster. Food exports had been falling and were in trade account deficit; however the value of food imports were a little over half that of manufactured imports.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the global economy entered the first stages of the Great Depression in late 1929, the US's main goal emerged to protect American jobs and farmers from foreign competition. Reed Smoot championed another tariff increase within the US in 1929, which became the SmootÿHawley Tariff Bill. In his memoirs, Smoot made it abundantly clear: \\r\\nThe world is paying for its ruthless destruction of life and property in the World War and for its failure to adjust purchasing power to productive capacity during the industrial revolution of the decade following the war.[8]\\r\\nSmoot was a Republican from Utah and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Willis C. Hawley, a Republican from Oregon, was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen campaigning for president during 1928, one of Herbert Hoover's promises to help beleaguered farmers had been to increase tariffs of agricultural products. Hoover won, and Republicans maintained comfortable majorities in the House and the Senate during 1928. Hoover then asked Congress for an increase of tariff rates for agricultural goods and a decrease of rates for industrial goods.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House passed a version of the act in May 1929, increasing tariffs on agricultural and industrial goods alike. The House bill passed on a vote of 264 to 147, with 244 Republicans and 20 Democrats voting in favor of the bill.[9] The Senate debated its bill until March 1930, with many Senators trading votes based on their states' industries. The Senate bill passed on a vote of 44 to 42, with 39 Republicans and 5 Democrats voting in favor of the bill.[9] The conference committee then aligned the two versions, largely by moving to the greater House tariffs.[10] The House passed the conference bill on a vote of 222 to 153, with the support of 208 Republicans and 14 Democrats.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1930, a petition was signed by 1,028 economists in the US asking President Hoover to veto the legislation, organized by Paul Douglas, Irving Fisher, James TFG Wood, Frank Graham, Ernest Patterson, Henry Seager, Frank Taussig, and Clair Wilcox.[11][12] Automobile executive Henry Ford spent an evening at the White House trying to convince Hoover to veto the bill, calling it \\"an economic stupidity.\\"[13] J. P. Morgan's chief executive Thomas W. Lamont said he \\"almost went down on [his] knees to beg Herbert Hoover to veto the asinine Hawley-Smoot tariff.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHoover opposed the bill and called it \\"vicious, extortionate, and obnoxious\\" because he felt it would undermine the commitment he had pledged to international cooperation. However, in spite of his opposition, Hoover yielded to influence from his own party and business leaders and signed the bill.[15] Hoover's fears were well founded.  Canada and other countries raised their own tariffs in retaliation after the bill had become law.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt spoke against the act while campaigning for president during 1932.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe consensus view among economists and economic historians is that the passage of the SmootÿHawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression,[16] although there is disagreement as to how much.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost economists and economic historians argue that tariffs have played only a minor role in the Great Depression:\\r\\n\\r\\nDouglas A. Irwin writes: \\"most economists, both liberal and conservative, doubt that Smoot Hawley played much of a role in the subsequent contraction. Milton Friedman also held the opinion that the Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 did not cause the Great Depression.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWilliam Bernstein writes \\"most economic historians now believe that only a minuscule part of that huge loss of both world GDP and the United States GDP can be ascribed to the tariff wars \\"because trade was only nine percent of global output, not enough to account for the seventeen percent drop in GDP following the Crash. He thinks the damage done could not possibly have exceeded 2 percent of world GDP and tariff \\"didn't even significantly deepen the Great Depression.\\"(A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World)\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Paul Krugman, \\"Protectionism was a result of the Depression, not a cause. Rising tariffs didnt even play a large role in the initial trade contraction\\"; \\"Where protectionism really mattered was in preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered\\".[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Temin, explains a tariff is an expansionary policy (favourable to economic growth), like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small. (Temin, P. 1989. Lessons from the Great Depression, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass)[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nNobel laureate Maurice Allais, thinks that tariff was rather helpful in the face of deregulation of competition in the global labor market and excessively loose credit prior to the Crash which, according to him, caused the crisis Financial and banking sectors.\\t\\r\\nHe notes higher trade barriers were partly a means to protect domestic demand from deflation and external disturbances. He observes domestic production in the major industrialized countries fell faster than international trade contracted; if contraction of foreign trade had been the cause of the Depression, he argues, the opposite should have occurred. So, the decline in trade between 1929 and 1933 was a consequence of the Depression, not a cause. Most of the trade contraction took place between January 1930 and July 1932, before the introduction of the majority of protectionist measures, excepting limited American measures applied in the summer of 1930. It was the collapse of international liquidity that caused of the contraction of trade.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThreats of retaliation by other countries began long before the bill was enacted into law in June 1930. As it passed the House of Representatives in May 1929, boycotts broke out and foreign governments moved to increase rates against American products, even though rates could be increased or decreased by the Senate or by the conference committee. By September 1929, Hoover's administration had received protest notes from 23 trading partners, but threats of retaliatory actions were ignored.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1930, Canada, the country's most loyal trading partner, retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of US exports to Canada.[22] Canada later also forged closer economic links with the British Empire via the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. France and Britain protested and developed new trade partners. Germany developed a system of trade via clearing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1932, with the depression only having worsened for workers and farmers despite Smoot and Hawley's promises of prosperity from a high tariff, the two lost their seats in the elections that year.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the two volume series published by the US Bureau of the Census entitled \\"The Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970, Bicentennial Edition,\\" tariff rates have been represented in two forms. The \\"dutiable tariff rate\\" peak of 1932 was 59.1%, second only to the 61.7% rate of 1830. However, in 1933, 63% of all imports were never taxed which the \\"dutiable tariff rate\\" does not reflect. The \\"free and dutiable rate\\" in 1929 was 13.5% and peaked under Smoot-Hawley in 1933 at 19.8% which is significantly below the 29.7% \\"free and dutiable rate\\" that the United States averaged from 1821 until 1900.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average tariff rate on dutiable imports [25][26] increased from 40.1% in 1929 to 59.1% in 1932 (+19%). However, it was already consistently at high level between 1865 and 1913 (from 38% to 52%). Moreover, It had also risen sharply in 1861 (from 18.61% to 36.2%; +17.6), between 1863 and 1866 (from 32.62% to 48.33%; +15.7%), between 1920 and 1922 (from 16.4% to 38.1%; +21.7%), without producing global depressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first, the tariff seemed to be a success. According to historian Robert Sobel, \\"Factory payrolls, construction contracts, and industrial production all increased sharply.\\" However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff became apparent.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nUS imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. GNP fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933.[27] Imports from Europe decreased from a 1929 high of $1.3 billion to just $390 million during 1932, while US exports to Europe decreased from $2.3 billion in 1929 to $784 million in 1932. Overall, world trade decreased by some 66% between 1929 and 1934.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing panel data estimates of export and import equations for 17 countries, Jakob B. Madsen (2002) estimated the effects of increasing tariff and non-tariff trade barriers on worldwide trade during the period 1929ÿ1932. He concluded that real international trade contracted somewhere around 33% overall. His estimates of the impact of various factors included about 14% because of declining GNP in each country, 8% because of increases in tariff rates, 5% because of deflation-induced tariff increases, and 6% because of the imposition of non-tariff barriers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new tariff imposed an effective tax rate of 60% on more than 3,200 products and materials imported into the United States, quadrupling previous tariff rates on individual items, but raising the average tariff rate to 19.2%, in line with average rates of that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnemployment was at 8% in 1930 when the SmootÿHawley tariff was passed, but the new law failed to lower it. The rate jumped to 16% in 1931, and 25% in 1932ÿ33.[29] There is some contention about whether this can necessarily be attributed to the tariff, however.[30][31] It was not until World War II, during which \\"the American economy expanded at an unprecedented rate\\",[32] that unemployment fell below 1930s levels.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nImports during 1929 were only 4.2% of the United States' GNP and exports were only 5.0%. Monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, who emphasize the central role of the money supply in causing the depression, note that the SmootÿHawley Act only had a contributory effect on the entire U.S. economy.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1932 Democratic campaign platform pledged to lower tariffs. After winning the election, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the now-Democratic Congress passed Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934. This act allowed the President to negotiate tariff reductions on a bilateral basis, and also treated such a tariff agreement as regular legislation, requiring a majority, rather than as a treaty requiring a two-thirds vote. This was one of the core components of the trade negotiating framework that developed after World War II. The tit-for-tat responses of other countries were understood to have contributed to a sharp reduction of trade in the 1930s. After World War II this understanding supported a push towards multi-lateral trading agreements that would prevent similar situations in the future. While the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 focused on foreign exchange and did not directly address tariffs, those involved wanted a similar framework for international trade. President Harry S. Truman launched this process in December 1945 with negotiations for the creation of a proposed International Trade Organization (ITO). As it happened, separate negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) moved more quickly, with an agreement signed in October 1947; in the end, the US never signed the ITO agreement. Adding a multilateral \\"most-favored-nation\\" component to that of reciprocity, the GATT served as a framework for the gradual reduction of tariffs over the subsequent half century.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPostÿWorld War II changes to the SmootÿHawley tariffs reflected a general tendency of the United States to reduce its tariff levels unilaterally while its trading partners retained their high levels. The American Tariff League Study of 1951 compared the free and dutiable tariff rates of 43 countries. It found that only seven nations had a lower tariff level than the US (5.1%), while eleven nations had free and dutiable tariff rates higher than the SmootÿHawley peak of 19.8% including the United Kingdom (25.6%). The 43-country average was 14.4% which was 0.9% higher than the US level of 1929 demonstrating that few nations were reciprocating in reducing their levels as the U.S. reduced its own.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the discussion leading up to the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) then-Vice President Al Gore mentioned the Smoot-Hawley tariff as a response to NAFTA objections voiced by Ross Perot during a debate in 1993 they had on The Larry King Show. He gave Perot a framed picture of Smoot and Hawley shaking hands after its passage.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe act has been compared to the 2010 Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), with Andrew Quinlan from the Center for Freedom and Prosperity calling FATCA \\"the worst economic idea to come out of Congress since SmootÿHawley\\".[37]","input":"How much did the gnp drop from 1929 to 1932?"},{"output":"September 2017","context":"","input":"When was the last nuclear reactor built in the us?"},{"output":"2,960 feet (902.21 m) per second","context":"The .243 Winchester (6G52mm) is a popular sporting rifle cartridge. Initially designed as a target/varmint round, it may be used for animals such as coyotes, blacktail deer, whitetail deer, mule deer, pronghorns, and wild hogs. It can also be used against larger animals such as black bears and elk but is sometimes said to be \\"too light\\" for such large animals. Rounds of at least 90 grains are better suited for hunting larger animals while rounds less than 90 grains are more suitable for varmints.[3] The .243 is based on a necked down .308 cartridge case. It is very popular with target shooters, metallic silhouette, and long range shooters, because of its accuracy and low recoil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis cartridge was first introduced in 1955 for the Winchester Model 70 bolt-action and Model 88 lever-action sporting rifles and quickly gained popularity among sportsmen worldwide.[4] Just about every major manufacturer offers rifles chambered in .243.\\r\\nIt was a ground-breaking development, combining a useful combination of lightweight (70 to 85 grain) bullets optimized for long-range performance for varmint hunters (groundhogs, coyotes, prairie dogs) and 90- to 105-grain bullets suitable for game up to the size of deer and pronghorn antelope. Its predecessor in the Winchester lineup, the very similar .257 Roberts, could have easily been selected to accomplish the same tasks, but was not available factory loaded with either lighter, varmint-weight bullets or pointed, long range spitzer (pointed) bullets, so it never achieved the popularity of the newer round.\\r\\nRemington also saw the 6 mm (.243\\") family as suitable for this dual-purpose use and introduced their version, the .244 Remington, in the same year (1955) based upon the .257 Roberts necked down to accept .243 bullets up to 90 grains in weight. The Winchester round remains available today whereas the .244 Remington, later renamed the 6mm Remington with the introduction of 100-grain bullets, is far less popular even though it can push all bullet weights slightly faster with maximum loads due to the larger capacity case. The fact that the .243 Win was originally offered in a 1 in 10\\" rifling twist rate, a rate better able to stabilize heavier, 100- and 105-grain bullets, versus the .244 Remington's 1 in 12\\" twist (hence the 90-grain factory offering) was also a factor in their popularity.\\r\\nSince the enactment of the Deer Act 1963 in the United Kingdom, which stipulates a minimum bullet diameter of .240 inches, together with minimum levels of muzzle velocity and bullet energy, the .243 is now perceived as the entry-level caliber for legal deer-stalking. Firearms that would normally be chambered in .308 Winchester/7.62G51mm NATO are sometimes available in .243 in countriesÿsuch as Spainÿwhose regulations restrict or forbid private ownership of so-called military calibers. No military is known to currently designate this round for service.\\r\\nIn a non-sporting context, bolt-action rifles chambered for the .243 were utilized by the Los Angeles Police Department's special weapons And tactics (SWAT) unit during its early years.[5] A specialist 115 grain projectile can move up to 3,150 fps from a 28-inch barrel, or over 3,000 fps from a 26-inch barrel.[6]\\r\\nP. O. Ackley created an improved version of this cartridge called the .243 Winchester Improved (Ackley).[7] Like other improved cartridges, this created a steeper shoulder and blew the sides out, giving about 10% more powder capacity, and some small improvement in velocity. Both versions of the .243 cartridge are good for hunting deer.\\r\\nThe .243 produces a velocity of 2,960 feet (902.21 m) per second with a 100-grain (6.6?gram) projectile from a 24-inch (610?mm) barrel. Commercially loaded .243 ammunition is available with bullet weights ranging from 55?grains (3.6?g) up to 115?grains (6.8?g). Twist rate of the barrel is the major deciding factor in which bullets to use, 1:10 being the most popular as it is sufficient to stabilize up to 100-gr. bullets. However, for very low drag-profile and bullets heavier than 100 grs., a 1:8 or 1:7 (for 115-gr. VLD bullets) is necessary.","input":"How many feet per second does a 243 shoot?"},{"output":"18 to 20 January 1788","context":"The First Fleet was the 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict transports, carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. From England, the Fleet sailed southwest to Rio de Janeiro, then east to Cape Town and via the Great Southern Ocean to Botany Bay, arriving over the period of 18 to 20 January 1788, taking 250 to 252 days from departure to final arrival.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConvicts were originally transported to the Thirteen Colonies in North America, but after the American War of Independence ended in 1783, the newly formed United States refused to accept further convicts.[1] On 6 December 1785, Orders in Council were issued in London for the establishment of a penal colony in New South Wales, on land claimed for Britain by explorer James Cook in his first voyage to the Pacific in 1770.[2][3]\\r\\nThe First Fleet was commanded by Commodore Arthur Phillip, who was given instructions authorising him to make regulations and land grants in the colony.[4] The ships arrived at Botany Bay between 18 January and 20 January 1788:[5] HMS Supply arrived on 18 January, Alexander, Scarborough and Friendship arrived on 19 January, and the remaining ships on 20 January.[6][7]\\r\\nThe cost to Britain of outfitting and despatching the Fleet was S84,000[8] (about S9.6 million as of 2015).[9]\\r\\nThe First Fleet included two Royal Navy escort ships, the ten-gun sixth-rate vessel HMS?Sirius under the command of Captain John Hunter, and the armed tender HMS?Supply commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.\\r\\nRopes, crockery, agricultural equipment and a miscellany of other stores were needed. Items transported included tools, agricultural implements, seeds, spirits, medical supplies, bandages, surgical instruments, handcuffs, leg irons and a prefabricated wooden frame for the colony's first Government House.[12] The party had to rely on its own provisions to survive until it could make use of local materials, assuming suitable supplies existed, and grow its own food and raise livestock.\\r\\nScale models of all the ships are on display at the Museum of Sydney. The models were built by ship makers Lynne and Laurie Hadley, after researching the original plans, drawings and British archives.

The unused names are Lady Penrhyn and Prince of Wales.\\r\\nThe people of the fleet included seamen, marines and their families, government officials, and a large number of convicts, including women and children. The majority were British, but there were also African, American and French convicts on board.[14][15] The convicts had committed a variety of crimes, including theft, perjury, fraud, assault, and robbery, for which they had variously been sentenced to penal transportation for 7 years, 14 years, or the term of their natural life.[16][17]\\r\\nThe six convict transports each had a detachment of marines on board. Most of the families of the marines traveled aboard the Prince of Wales.[18] A number of people on the First Fleet kept diaries and journals of their experiences, including the surgeons. There are twelve known journals in existence as well as some letters.[19]\\r\\nThe exact number of people directly associated with the First Fleet will likely never be established, as accounts of the event vary slightly. A total of 1,420 people have been identified as embarking on the First Fleet in 1787, and 1,373 are believed to have landed at Sydney Cove in January 1788. In her biographical dictionary of the First Fleet, Mollie Gillen gives the following statistics:[20]\\r\\nWhile the names of all crew members of Sirius and Supply are known, the six transports and three storeships may have carried as many as 110 more seamen than have been identified ÿ no complete musters have survived for these ships.

Golden Grove carried the chaplain for the colony, with his wife and a servant.\\r\\nNot only these store-ships, but the men of war and transports were laden with provisions, implements of agriculture, camp equipage, clothing for the convicts, baggage, etc.\\r\\nThe Sirius carried as supernumeraries, the major commandant of the corps of marines embarked in the transports* [*This officer was also lieutenant-governor of the colony], the adjutant and quarter-master, the judge-advocate of the settlement, and the commissary; with one sergeant, three drummers, seven privates, four women, and a few artificers.\\r\\nThe chief surgeon for the First Fleet, John White, reported a total of 48 deaths and 28 births during the voyage. The deaths during the voyage included one marine, one marine's wife, one marine's child, 36 male convicts, four female convicts, and five children of convicts.[24]\\r\\nThe First Fleet left Portsmouth, England on 13 May 1787.[25] The journey began with fine weather, and thus the convicts were allowed on deck.[26] The Fleet was accompanied by the armed frigate Hyena until it left English waters.[27] On 20 May 1787, one convict on the Scarborough reported a planned mutiny; those allegedly involved were flogged and two were transferred to Prince of Wales.[27] In general, however, most accounts of the voyage agree that the convicts were well behaved.[27] On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife.[25] Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape.[28] On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro,[25] taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.\\r\\nThe weather became increasingly hot and humid as the Fleet sailed through the tropics. Vermin, such as rats, and parasites such as bedbugs, lice, cockroaches and fleas, tormented the convicts, officers and marines. Bilges became foul and the smell, especially below the closed hatches, was over-powering.[29] While Phillip gave orders that the bilge-water was to be pumped out daily and the bilges cleaned, these orders were not followed on the Alexander and a number of convicts fell sick and died.[29] Tropical rainstorms meant that the convicts could not exercise on deck as they had no change of clothes and no method of drying wet clothing.[29] Consequently, they were kept below in the foul, cramped holds. On the female transports, promiscuity between the convicts, the crew and marines was rampant, despite punishments for some of the men involved.[29] In the doldrums, Phillip was forced to ration the water to three pints a day.[29]\\r\\nThe Fleet reached Rio de Janeiro on 5 August and stayed for a month.[25] The ships were cleaned and water taken on board, repairs were made, and Phillip ordered large quantities of food.[26] The women convicts' clothing had become infested with lice and was burnt. As additional clothing for the female convicts had not arrived before the Fleet left England,[26] the women were issued with new clothes made from rice sacks. While the convicts remained below deck, the officers explored the city and were entertained by its inhabitants.[30] A convict and a marine were punished for passing forged quarter-dollars made from old buckles and pewter spoons.\\r\\nThe Fleet left Rio de Janeiro on 4 September to run before the westerlies to the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, which it reached on 13 October.[31] This was the last port of call, so the main task was to stock up on plants, seeds and livestock for their arrival in Australia.[32] The livestock taken on board from the Cape of Good Hope destined for the new colony included two bulls, seven cows, one stallion, three mares, 44 sheep, 32 pigs, four goats and \\"a very large quantity of poultry of every kind\\".[33] Women convicts on the Friendship were moved to other transports to make room for livestock purchased there. The convicts were provided with fresh beef and mutton, bread and vegetables, to build up their strength for the journey and maintain their health.[32] The Dutch colony of Cape Town was the last outpost of European settlement which the fleet members would see for years, perhaps for the rest of their lives. \\"Before them stretched the awesome, lonely void of the Indian and Southern Oceans, and beyond that lay nothing they could imagine.\\"[34]\\r\\nAssisted by the gales in the \\"Roaring Forties\\" latitudes below the 40th parallel, the heavily laden transports surged through the violent seas. In the last two months of the voyage, the Fleet faced challenging conditions, spending some days becalmed and on others covering significant distances; the Friendship travelled 166 miles one day, while a seaman was blown from the Prince of Wales at night and drowned.[35] Water was rationed as supplies ran low, and the supply of other goods including wine ran out altogether on some vessels.[35] Van Diemen's Land was sighted from the Friendship on 4 January 1788.[35] A freak storm struck as they began to head north around the island, damaging the sails and masts of some of the ships.\\r\\nOn 25 November, Phillip had transferred to the Supply. With Alexander, Friendship and Scarborough, the fastest ships in the Fleet, which were carrying most of the male convicts, the Supply hastened ahead to prepare for the arrival of the rest. Phillip intended to select a suitable location, find good water, clear the ground, and perhaps even have some huts and other structures built before the others arrived. This was a planned move, discussed by the Home Office and the Admiralty prior to the Fleet's departure.[36] However, this \\"flying squadron\\" reached Botany Bay only hours before the rest of the Fleet, so no preparatory work was possible.[37] Supply reached Botany Bay on 18 January 1788; the three fastest transports in the advance group arrived on 19 January; slower ships, including Sirius, arrived on 20 January.[38]\\r\\nThis was one of the world's greatest sea voyages ÿ eleven vessels carrying about 1,487 people and stores[33] had travelled for 252 days for more than 15,000 miles (24,000?km) without losing a ship. Forty-eight people died on the journey, a death rate of just over three per cent.\\r\\nIt was soon realised that Botany Bay did not live up to the glowing account that the explorer Captain James Cook had provided.[39] The bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow to allow the ships to anchor close to the shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor.[40] First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious of the newcomers. The area was studded with enormously strong trees. When the convicts tried to cut them down, their tools broke and the tree trunks had to be blasted out of the ground with gunpowder. The primitive huts built for the officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines had a habit of getting drunk and not guarding the convicts properly, whilst their commander, Major Robert Ross, drove Phillip to despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorised to establish the colony elsewhere if necessary.[41]\\r\\nOn 21 January, Phillip and a party which included John Hunter, departed the Bay in three small boats to explore other bays to the north.[43] Phillip discovered that Port Jackson, about 12 kilometres to the north, was an excellent site for a colony with sheltered anchorages, fresh water and fertile soil.[43] Cook had seen and named the harbour, but had not entered it.[43] Phillip's impressions of the harbour were recorded in a letter he sent to England later: \\"the finest harbour in the world, in which a thousand sail of the line may ride in the most perfect security ...\\". The party returned to Botany Bay on 23 January.[43]\\r\\nOn the morning of 24 January, the party was startled when two French ships were seen just outside Botany Bay. This was a scientific expedition led by Jean-Fran?ois de La Prouse. The French had expected to find a thriving colony where they could repair ships and restock supplies, not a newly arrived fleet of convicts considerably more poorly provisioned than themselves.[44] There was some cordial contact between the French and British officers, but Phillip and La Prouse never met. The French ships remained until 10 March before setting sail on their return voyage. They were not seen again and were later discovered to have been shipwrecked off the coast of Vanikoro in the present-day Solomon Islands.[45]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1788, the Fleet weighed anchor and sailed to Port Jackson.[25] The site selected for the anchorage had deep water close to the shore, was sheltered, and had a small stream flowing into it. Phillip named it Sydney Cove, after Lord Sydney the British Home Secretary.[43] This date is celebrated as Australia Day, marking the beginning of British settlement.[46] The British flag was planted and formal possession taken. This was done by Phillip and some officers and marines from the Supply, with the remainder of Supply's crew and the convicts observing from on board ship. The remaining ships of the Fleet did not arrive at Sydney Cove until later that day.[47]\\r\\nThe First Fleet encountered indigenous Australians when they landed at Botany Bay. The Cadigal people of the Botany Bay area witnessed the Fleet arrive and six days later the two ships of French explorer La Prouse sailed into the bay.[48] When the Fleet moved to Sydney Cove seeking better conditions for establishing the colony, they encountered the Eora people, including the Bidjigal clan. A number of the First Fleet journals record encounters with Aboriginal people.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the official policy of the British Government was to establish friendly relations with Aboriginal people,[41] and Arthur Phillip ordered that the Aboriginal people should be well treated, it was not long before conflict began. The colonists did not sign treaties with the original inhabitants of the land.[50] Between 1790 and 1810, Pemulwuy of the Bidjigal clan led the local people in a series of attacks against the British colonisers.[51]\\r\\nThe ships of the First Fleet mostly did not remain in the colony. Some returned to England, while others left for other ports. Some remained at the service of the Governor of the colony for some months: some of these were sent to Norfolk Island where a second penal colony was established.\\r\\n1788\\r\\n1789\\r\\n1790:\\r\\nOn 26 January 1842, the Colonial Government in Sydney awarded a life pension of 1 shilling a day to three surviving members of the First Fleet. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported, on Saturday 29 January 1842: \\"The Government have ordered a pension of one shilling per diem to be paid to the survivors of those who came by the first vessel into the Colony. The number of these really 'old hands' is now reduced to three, of whom, two are now in the Benevolent Asylum, and the other is a fine hale old fellow, who can do a day's work with more spirit than many of the young fellows lately arrived in the Colony.\\"[53] The names of the three recipients are not given.\\r\\nWilliam Hubbard: Hubbard was convicted in the Kingston Assizes in Surrey, England, on 24 March 1784 for theft.[54] He was transported to Australia on the Scarborough in the First Fleet. He married Mary Goulding on 19 December 1790 in Rose Hill. In 1803 he received a land grant of 70 acres at Mulgrave Place. He died on 18 May 1843 at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum. His age was given as 76 when he was buried at Christ Church St. Lawrence, Sydney on 22 May 1843.\\r\\nJohn McCarthy: McCarthy was a Marine who sailed on the Friendship.[55] McCarthy was born in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, circa Christmas 1745. He first served in the colony of New South Wales, then at Norfolk Island where he took up a land grant of 60 acres (Lot 110). He married the first fleet convict Ann Beardsley on Norfolk Island in November 1791 after his discharge a month earlier. In 1808, on the close of Norfolk Island settlement, he resettled in Van Diemen's Land and later took a land grant (80 acres at Melville) in lieu of the one forfeited on Norfolk Island. The last few years of his life were spent at the home of his granddaughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. William H. Budd, at a place called Kinlochewe Inn near Donnybrook, Victoria. McCarthy died on 24 July 1846,[56] six months past his 100 birthday.\\r\\nJohn Limeburner: The South Australian Register reported, in an article dated Wednesday 3 November 1847: \\"John Limeburner, the oldest colonist in Sydney, died in September last, at the advanced age of 104 years. He helped to pitch the first tent in Sydney, and remembered the first display of the British flag there, which was hoisted on a swamp oak-tree, then growing on a spot now occupied as the Water-Police Court. He was the last of those called the 'first-fleeters' (arrivals by the first convict ships) and, notwithstanding his great age, retained his faculties to the last.\\"[57] John Limeburner was a convict on the Charlotte. He was convicted on 9 July 1785 at New Sarum, Wiltshire of theft of a waistcoat, a shirt and stockings.[58] He married Elizabeth Ireland in 1790 at Rosehill and together they establish a 50-acre farm at Prospect.[59] He died at Ashfield in September 1847 and is buried at St John's, Ashfield.\\r\\nJohn Jones: Jones was a Marine on the First Fleet and sailed on the Alexander. He is listed in the N.S.W. 1828 Census as aged 82 and living at the Sydney Benevolent Asylum.[60] He is said to have died at the Benevolent Asylum in 1848.[61]\\r\\nSamuel King: King was a scribbler (a worker in a scribbling mill[62]) before he became a Marine. He was a Marine with the First Fleet on board the flagship Sirius?(1786).[63] He shipped to Norfolk Island on Golden Grove in September 1788, where he lived with Mary Rolt, a convict who arrived with the First Fleet on the Prince of Wales. He received a grant of 60 acres (Lot No. 13) at Cascade Stream in 1791. Mary Rolt returned to England on the Britannia in October 1796. King was resettled in Van Diemen's Land, boarding the City of Edinburgh on 3 September 1808, and landed in Hobart on 3 October.[64] He married Elizabeth Thackery on 28 January 1810. He died on 21 October 1849 at 86 years of age and was buried in the Wesleyan cemetery at Lawitta Road, Back River.\\r\\nJohn Small: Convicted 14 March 1785 at the Devon Lent Assizes held at Exeter for Robbery King's Highway. Sentenced to hang, reprieved to 7 years transportation. Arrived on the Charlotte in First Fleet 1788. Certificate of freedom 1792. Land Grant 1794, 30 acre \\"Small's Farm\\" at Eastern Farms (Ryde). Married October 1788 Mary Parker also a First Fleet convict who arrived on Lady Penrhyn. John Small died on 2 October 1850 at age of 90 years.[65][66]\\r\\nElizabeth Thackery: Elizabeth \\"Betty\\" King (ne Thackery) was tried and convicted of theft on 4 May 1786 at Manchester Quarter Sessions, and sentenced to seven years transportation. She sailed on the Friendship, but was transferred to the Charlotte at the Cape of Good Hope. She was shipped to Norfolk Island on the Sirius?(1786) in 1790 and lived there with James Dodding. In August 1800 she bought 10 acres of land from Samuel King at Cascade Stream. Elizabeth and James were relocated to Van Diemen's Land in December 1807[67] but parted company sometime afterwards. On 28 January 1810 Elizabeth married \\"First Fleeter\\" Private Samuel King (above) and lived with him until his death in 1849. Betty King died in New Norfolk, Tasmania on 7 August 1856, aged 89 years. She is buried in the churchyard of the Methodist Chapel, Lawitta Road, Back River, next to her husband, and the marked grave bears a First Fleet plaque. She was one of the first British women to land in Australia and was the last \\"First Fleeter\\" to die.\\r\\nHistorians have disagreed over whether those aboard the First Fleet were responsible for introducing smallpox to Australia's indigenous population, and if so, whether this was the consequence of deliberate action.\\r\\nIn 1914, J.?H.?L. Cumpston, director of the Australian Quarantine Service put forward the hypothesis that smallpox arrived with British settlers.[68] Some researchers have argued that any such release may have been a deliberate attempt to decimate the indigenous population.[69][70] Others have suggested that live smallpox virus may have been introduced accidentally, when Aboriginal people came into contact with variolous matter brought by the First Fleet for use in anti-smallpox inoculations.[71][72][73] Hypothetical scenarios for such an action might have included: an act of revenge by an aggrieved individual, a response to attacks by indigenous people,[74] or part of an orchestrated assault by the New South Wales Marine Corps, intended to clear the path for colonial expansion.[75][76]\\r\\nOther historians have disputed the idea that there was a deliberate release of smallpox virus and/or suggest that it arrived with visitors to Australia other than the First Fleet.[77][78][79][80][81] In 2002, historian Judy Campbell suggested that smallpox had arrived in Australia through contact with fishermen from Makassar in Indonesia, where smallpox was endemic.[79][82] In 2011, Macknight stated: The overwhelming probability must be that it [smallpox] was introduced, like the later epidemics, by [Indonesian] trepangers ... and spread across the continent to arrive in Sydney quite independently of the new settlement there.[83]\\r\\nThere is a third theory, that the 1789 epidemic was not smallpox but chickenpox ÿ to which indigenous Australians also had no inherited resistance ÿ that happened to be affecting, or was carried by, members of the First Fleet.[84][85] This theory has also been disputed.[86][87]\\r\\nAfter Ray Collins, a stonemason, completed years of research into the First Fleet, he sought approval from about nine councils to construct a commemorative garden in recognition of these immigrants. Liverpool Plains Shire Council was ultimately the only council to accept his offer to supply the materials and construct the garden free of charge. The site chosen was a disused caravan park on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. In September 2002 Collins commenced work on the project. Additional support was later provided by Neil McGarry in the form of some signs and the council contributed $28,000 for pathways and fencing. Collins hand-chiseled the names of all those who came to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on stone tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.[88] On 26 January 2005, the First Fleet Garden was opened as the major memorial to the First Fleet immigrants. Previously the only other specific memorial to the First Fleeters was an obelisk at Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales.[89] The surrounding area has a barbecue, tables, and amenities.","input":"When did the first fleet arrived in aus?"},{"output":"Jerusalem","context":"Early Christianity (generally considered the time period from its origin to the First Council of Nicaea in 325) spread from the Eastern Mediterranean throughout the Roman Empire and beyond. Originally, this progression was closely connected to already established Jewish centers in the Holy Land and the Jewish diaspora. The first followers of Christianity were Jews or proselytes, commonly referred to as Jewish Christians and God-fearers.\\r\\nThe Apostolic sees claim to have been founded by one or more of the apostles of Jesus, who are said to have dispersed from Jerusalem sometime after the crucifixion of Jesus, c. 26ÿ36, perhaps following the Great Commission. Early Christians gathered in small private homes,[1] known as house churches, but a city's whole Christian community would also be called a church ÿ the Greek noun ?ٰҿ?ϫ literally means assembly, gathering, or congregation[2][3] but is translated as church in most English translations of the New Testament.\\r\\nMany of these Early Christians were merchants and others who had practical reasons for traveling to northern Africa, Asia Minor, Arabia, Greece, and other places.[4][5][6] Over 40 such communities were established by the year 100,[5][6] many in Anatolia, also known as Asia Minor, such as the Seven churches of Asia. By the end of the first century, Christianity had already spread to Rome and major cities in Armenia, Greece and Syria, serving as foundations for the expansive spread of Christianity, eventually throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJerusalem was the first center of the church, according to the Book of Acts, and according to the Catholic Encyclopedia: the location of \\"the first Christian church\\".[8] The apostles lived and taught there for some time after Pentecost.[9] Jesus' brother James was a leader in the church, and his other kinsmen likely held leadership positions in the surrounding area after the destruction of the city until its rebuilding as Aelia Capitolina, c. 130, when all Jews were banished from the city.[9] In about 50, Barnabas and Paul went to Jerusalem to meet with the \\"pillars of the church\\":[10] James, Peter, and John. Later called the Council of Jerusalem, this meeting, among other things, confirmed the legitimacy of the mission of Barnabas and Paul to the gentiles, and the gentile converts' freedom from most Mosaic law, especially circumcision, which was repulsive to the Hellenic mind.[11] Thus, the Apostolic Decree (Acts 15:19ÿ21) may be a major act of differentiation of the Church from its Jewish roots[12], though the decree may simply parallel Jewish Noahide Law and thus be a commonality rather than a differential. In roughly the same time period Rabbinic Judaism made their circumcision requirement of Jewish boys even stricter.[13]\\r\\nWhen Peter left Jerusalem after Herod Agrippa I tried to kill him, James appears as the principal authority.[14] Clement of Alexandria (c. 150ÿ215) called him Bishop of Jerusalem.[14] A second-century church historian, Hegesippus, wrote that the Sanhedrin martyred him in 62.[14]\\r\\nIn 66, the Jews revolted against Rome.[9] Rome besieged Jerusalem for four years, and the city fell in 70.[9] The city was destroyed, including the Temple, and the population was mostly killed or removed.[9] According to a tradition recorded by Eusebius and Epiphanius of Salamis, the Jerusalem church fled to Pella at the outbreak of the First Jewish Revolt (see: Flight to Pella).;[15][16] According to Epiphanius of Salamis,[17] the Cenacle survived at least to Hadrian's visit in 130. A scattered population survived.[9] The Sanhedrin relocated to Jamnia.[18] Prophecies of the Second Temple's destruction are found in the synoptics,[19] specifically in the Olivet Discourse.\\r\\nIn the 2nd century, Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem as a pagan city called Aelia Capitolina,[20] erecting statues of Jupiter and himself on the site of the former Jewish Temple, the Temple Mount. Bar Cochba led an unsuccessful revolt as a Messiah, but Christians refused to acknowledge him as such. When Bar Cochba was defeated, Hadrian barred Jews from the city, except for the day of Tisha B'Av, thus the subsequent Jerusalem bishops were gentiles (\\"uncircumcised\\") for the first time.[21]\\r\\nThe general significance of Jerusalem to Christians entered a period of decline during the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, but resumed again with the pilgrimage of Helena (the mother of Constantine the Great) to the Holy Land c. 326ÿ28. According to the church historian Socrates of Constantinople,[22] Helena (with the assistance of Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem) claimed to have found the cross of Christ, after removing a Temple to Venus (attributed to Hadrian) that had been built over the site. (For that reason she is seen as the patron saint of Archaeologists.) Jerusalem had received special recognition in Canon VII of Nicaea in 325.[23] The traditional founding date for the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre (which guards the Christian Holy places in the Holy Land) is 313 which corresponds with the date of the Edict of Milan which legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire. Jerusalem was later named as one of the Pentarchy, but this was never accepted by the church of Rome.[24][25] See also EastÿWest Schism#Prospects for reconciliation.\\r\\nAntioch, a major center of Hellenistic Greece, and the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,[26] then part of Syria Province, today a ruin near Antakya, Turkey, was where Christians were first so-called[27] and also the location of the Incident at Antioch. It was the site of an early church, traditionally said to be founded by Peter who is considered the first bishop. The Gospel of Matthew and the Apostolic Constitutions may have been written there. The church father Ignatius of Antioch was its third bishop. The School of Antioch, founded in 270, was one of two major centers of early church learning. The Curetonian Gospels and the Syriac Sinaiticus are two early (pre-Peshitta) New Testament text types associated with Syriac Christianity. It was one of the three whose bishops were recognized at the First Council of Nicaea (325) as exercising jurisdiction over the adjoining territories.[28]\\r\\nAlexandria, in the Nile delta, was established by Alexander the Great. Its famous libraries were a center of Hellenistic learning. The Septuagint translation of the Old Testament began there and the Alexandrian text-type is recognized by scholars as one of the earliest New Testament types. It had a significant Jewish population, of which Philo of Alexandria is probably its most known author.[29] It produced superior scripture and notable church fathers, such as Clement, Origen, and Athanasius,[30] also noteworthy were the nearby Desert Fathers. By the end of the era, Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch were accorded authority over nearby metropolitans. The Council of Nicaea in canon VI affirmed Alexandria's traditional authority over Egypt, Libya, and Pentapolis (North Africa) (the Diocese of Egypt) and probably granted Alexandria the right to declare a universal date for the observance of Easter,[31] see also Easter controversy. Some postulate, however, that Alexandria was not only a center of Christianity, but was also a center for Christian-based Gnostic sects. see also Gnosticism.\\r\\nThe tradition of John the Apostle was strong in Anatolia (the near-east, part of modern Turkey, the western part was called the Roman province of Asia). The authorship of the Johannine works traditionally and plausibly occurred in Ephesus, c. 90-110, although some scholars argue for an origin in Syria.[32] According to the New Testament, the Apostle Paul was from Tarsus (in south-central Anatolia) and his missionary journeys were primarily in Anatolia. The Book of Revelation, believed to be authored by John of Patmos (a Greek island about 30 miles off the Anatolian coast), mentions Seven churches of Asia. The First Epistle of Peter (1:1ÿ2) is addressed to Anatolian regions. On the southeast shore of the Black Sea, Pontus was a Greek colony mentioned three times in the New Testament. Inhabitants of Pontus were some of the very first converts to Christianity. Pliny, governor in 110, in his letters, addressed Christians in Pontus. Of the extant letters of Ignatius of Antioch considered authentic, five of seven are to Anatolian cities, the sixth is to Polycarp. Smyrna was home to Polycarp, the bishop who reportedly knew the Apostle John personally, and probably also to his student Irenaeus. Papias of Hierapolis is also believed to have been a student of John the Apostle. In the 2nd century, Anatolia was home to Quartodecimanism, Montanism, Marcion of Sinope, and Melito of Sardis who recorded an early Christian Biblical canon. After the Crisis of the Third Century, Nicomedia became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire in 286. The Synod of Ancyra was held in 314. In 325 the emperor Constantine convoked the first Christian ecumenical council in Nicaea and in 330 moved the capital of the reunified empire to Byzantium (also an early Christian center and just across the Bosphorus from Anatolia, later called Constantinople), referred to as the Byzantine Empire, which lasted till 1453.[33] The First seven Ecumenical Councils were held either in Western Anatolia or across the Bosphorus in Constantinople.\\r\\nCaesarea, on the seacoast just northwest of Jerusalem, at first Caesarea Maritima, then after 133 Caesarea Palaestina, was built by Herod the Great, c. 25ÿ13 BC, and was the capital of Iudaea Province (6ÿ132) and later Palaestina Prima. It was there that Peter baptized the centurion Cornelius, considered the first gentile convert. Paul sought refuge there, once staying at the house of Philip the Evangelist, and later being imprisoned there for two years (estimated to be 57ÿ59). The Apostolic Constitutions (7.46) state that the first Bishop of Caesarea was Zacchaeus the Publican but the Catholic Encyclopedia claims that: \\"...there is no record of any bishops of Caesarea until the second century. At the end of this century a council was held there to regulate the celebration of Easter.\\"[34] According to another Catholic Encyclopedia article,[35] after Hadrian's siege of Jerusalem (c.133), Caesarea became the metropolitan see with the bishop of Jerusalem as one of its \\"suffragans\\" (subordinates). Origen (d.254) compiled his Hexapla there and it held a famous library and theological school, St. Pamphilus (d.309) was a noted scholar-priest. St. Gregory the Wonder-Worker (d.270), St. Basil the Great (d.379), and St. Jerome (d.420) visited and studied at the library which was later destroyed, probably by the Persians in 614 or the Saracens around 637.[36] The first major church historian, Eusebius of Caesarea, was a bishop, c. 314ÿ339. F. J. A. Hort and Adolf von Harnack have argued that the Nicene Creed originated in Caesarea. The Caesarean text-type is recognized by many textual scholars as one of the earliest New Testament types.\\r\\nPaphos was the capital of the island of Cyprus during the Roman years and seat of a Roman commander. In 45 AD, the apostles Paul and Barnabas (according to the Catholic Encyclopedia \\"a native of the island\\") came to Cyprus and reached Paphos preaching the Word of Christ, see also Acts 13:4ÿ13. According to Acts, the apostles were persecuted by the Romans but eventually succeeded in convincing the Roman commander Sergius Paulus to renounce his old religion in favour of Christianity. Barnabas is traditionally identified as the founder of the Cypriot Orthodox Church.[37]\\r\\nDamascus is the capital of Syria and claims to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. According to the New Testament, the Apostle Paul was converted on the Road to Damascus. In the three accounts (Acts 9:1ÿ20, 22:1ÿ22, 26:1ÿ24), he is described as being led by those he was traveling with, blinded by the light, to Damascus where his sight was restored by a disciple called Ananias (who, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia, is thought to have been the first Bishop of Damascus) then he was baptized.\\r\\nThessaloniki, the major northern Greek city where it is believed Christianity was founded by Paul, thus an Apostolic See, and the surrounding regions of Macedonia, Western and Eastern Thrace, and Epirus, which also extend into the neighboring Balkan states of Albania and Bulgaria, were early centers of Christianity. Of note are Paul's Epistles to the Thessalonians and to Philippi, which is often considered the first contact of Christianity with Europe.[38] The Apostolic Father Polycarp wrote a letter to the Philippians, c.125.\\r\\nNicopolis was a city in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus, today a ruin on the northern part of the western Greek coast. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"St. Paul intended going there (Titus 3:12) and it is possible that even then it numbered some Christians among its population; Origen (c.?185ÿ254) sojourned there for a while (Eusebius, Church History VI.16).\\"\\r\\nAncient Corinth, today a ruin near modern Corinth in southern Greece, was an early center of Christianity. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"St. Paul preached successfully at Corinth, where he lived in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:1), where Silas and Timothy soon joined him. After his departure he was replaced by Apollo, who had been sent from Ephesus by Priscilla. The Apostle visited Corinth at least once more. He wrote to the Corinthians in 57 from Ephesus, and then from Macedonia in the same year, or in 58. The famous letter of St. Clement of Rome to the Corinthian church (about 96) exhibits the earliest evidence concerning the ecclesiastical primacy of the Roman Church. Besides St. Apollo, Lequien (II, 155) mentions forty-three bishops: among them, St. Sosthenes (?), the disciple of St. Paul, St. Dionysius; Paul, brother of St. Peter ...\\"[39]\\r\\nAthens, the capital and largest city in Greece, was visited by Paul. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: Paul \\"came to Athens from Ber?a of Macedonia, coming probably by water and landing in the Peir?evs, the harbour of Athens. This was about the year 53. Having arrived at Athens, he at once sent for Silas and Timotheos who had remained behind in Ber?a. While awaiting the coming of these he tarried in Athens, viewing the idolatrous city, and frequenting the synagogue; for there were already Jews in Athens. ... It seems that a Christian community was rapidly formed, although for a considerable time it did not possess a numerous membership. The commoner tradition names the Areopagite as the first head and bishop of the Christian Athenians. Another tradition, however, gives this honour to Hierotheos the Thesmothete. The successors of the first bishop were not all Athenians by lineage. They are catalogued as Narkissos, Publius, and Quadratus. Narkissos is stated to have come from Palestine, and Publius from Malta. In some lists Narkissos is omitted. Quadratus is revered for having contributed to early Christian literature by writing an apology, which he addressed to the Emperor Hadrian. This was on the occasion of Hadrian's visit to Athens. Another Athenian who defended Christianity in writing at a somewhat later time was Aristeides. His apology was directed to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Athenagoras also wrote an apology. In the second century there must have been a considerable community of Christians in Athens, for Hygeinos, Bishop of Rome, is said to have written a letter to the community in the year 139.\\"\\r\\nGortyn on Crete, was allied with Rome and was thus made capital of Roman Creta et Cyrenaica. St. Titus is believed to have been the first bishop. The city was sacked by the pirate Abu Hafs in 828.\\r\\nCyrene and the surrounding region of Cyrenaica or the North African \\"Pentapolis\\", south of the Mediterranean from Greece, the northeastern part of modern Libya, was a Greek colony in North Africa later converted to a Roman province. In addition to Greeks and Romans, there was also a significant Jewish population, at least up to the Kitos War (115ÿ117). According to Mark 15:21, Simon of Cyrene carried Jesus' cross. Cyrenians are also mentioned in Acts 2:10, 6:9, 11:20, 13:1. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Lequien mentions six bishops of Cyrene, and according to Byzantine legend the first was St. Lucius (Acts 13:1); St. Theodorus suffered martyrdom under Diocletian;\\" (284ÿ305).\\r\\nExactly when Christians first appeared in Rome is difficult to determine (see Godfearers, Proselytes, and History of the Jews in the Roman Empire for the historical background). The Acts of the Apostles claims that the Jewish Christian couple Priscilla and Aquila had recently come from Rome to Corinth when, in about the year 50, Paul reached the latter city,[40] indicating that belief in Jesus in Rome had preceded Paul.\\r\\nHistorians consistently consider Peter and Paul to have been martyred in Rome under the reign of Nero[41][42][43] in 64, after the Great Fire of Rome which, according to Tacitus, the Emperor blamed on the Christians.[44][45] In the second century Irenaeus of Lyons, reflecting the ancient view that the church could not be fully present anywhere without a bishop, recorded that Peter and Paul had been the founders of the Church in Rome and had appointed Linus as bishop.[46][47]\\r\\nHowever, Irenaeus does not say that either Peter or Paul was \\"bishop\\" of the Church in Rome and several historians have questioned whether Peter spent much time in Rome before his martyrdom. While the church in Rome was already flourishing when Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans to them from Corinth (c.58)[48] he attests to a large Christian community already there[45] and greets some fifty people in Rome by name,[49] but not Peter whom he knew. There is also no mention of Peter in Rome later during Paul's two-year stay there in Acts 28, about 60ÿ62. Most likely he did not spend any major time at Rome before 58 when Paul wrote to the Romans, and so it may have been only in the 60s and relatively shortly before his martyrdom that Peter came to the capital.[50]\\r\\nOscar Cullmann sharply rejected the claim that Peter began the papal succession,[51] and concludes that while Peter was the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.[51][52]\\r\\nThe original seat of Roman imperial power soon became a center of church authority, grew in power decade by decade, and was recognized during the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, when the seat of government had been transferred to Constantinople, as the \\"head\\" of the church.[53]\\r\\nRome and Alexandria, which by tradition held authority over sees outside their own province,[54] were not yet referred to as patriarchates.[55]\\r\\nThe earliest Bishops of Rome were all Greek-speaking, the most notable of them being: Pope Clement I (c. 88ÿ97), author of an Epistle to the Church in Corinth; Pope Telesphorus (c. 126ÿ136), probably the only martyr among them; Pope Pius I (c. 141ÿ154), said by the Muratorian fragment to have been the brother of the author of the Shepherd of Hermas; and Pope Anicetus (c. 155ÿ160), who received Saint Polycarp and discussed with him the dating of Easter.[45]\\r\\nPope Victor I (189ÿ198) was the first ecclesiastical writer known to have written in Latin; however, his only extant works are his encyclicals, which would naturally have been issued in both Latin and Greek.[56]\\r\\nGreek New Testament texts were translated into Latin early on, well before Jerome, and are classified as the Vetus Latina and Western text-type.\\r\\nDuring the 2nd century, Christians and semi-Christians of diverse views congregated in Rome, notably Marcion and Valentinius, and in the following century there were schisms connected with Hippolytus of Rome and Novatian.[45]\\r\\nThe Roman church survived various persecutions. Among the prominent Christians executed as a result of their refusal to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods as ordered by emperor Valerian in 258 were Cyprian, bishop of Carthage.[57] The last and most severe of the imperial persecutions was that under Diocletian in 303; they ended in Rome, and the West in general, with the accession of Maxentius in 306.\\r\\nCarthage, in the Roman province of Africa, south of the Mediterranean from Rome, gave the early church the Latin fathers Tertullian[58] (c. 120ÿc. 220) and Cyprian[59] (d. 258). Carthage fell to Islam in 698.\\r\\nThe Mediterranean coast of France and the Rhone valley, then part of Roman Gallia Narbonensis, were early centers of Christianity. Major cities are Arles, Avignon, Vienne, Lyon, and Marseille (the oldest city in France). The Persecution in Lyon occurred in 177. The Apostolic Father Irenaeus from Smyrna of Anatolia was Bishop of Lyon near the end of the 2nd century and he claimed Saint Pothinus was his predecessor. The Council of Arles in 314 is considered a forerunner of the ecumenical councils. The Ephesine theory attributes the Gallican Rite to Lyon.\\r\\nThe ancient Roman city of Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic Sea, today one of the main archaeological sites of Northern Italy, was an early center of Christianity said to be founded by Mark before his mission to Alexandria. Hermagoras of Aquileia is believed to be its first bishop. The Aquileian Rite is associated with Aquileia.\\r\\nIt is believed that the Church of Milan in northwest Italy was founded by the apostle Barnabas in the 1st century. Gervasius and Protasius and others were martyred there. It has long maintained its own rite known as the Ambrosian Rite attributed to Ambrose (born c. 330) who was bishop in 374ÿ397 and one of the most influential ecclesiastical figures of the 4th century. Duchesne argues that the Gallican Rite originated in Milan.\\r\\nSyracuse was founded by Greek colonists in 734 or 733 BC, part of Magna Graecia. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Syracuse claims to be the second Church founded by St. Peter, after that of Antioch. It also claims that St. Paul preached there. ... In the times of St. Cyprian (the middle of the third century), Christianity certainly flourished at Syracuse, and the catacombs clearly show that this was the case in the second century.\\" Across the Strait of Messina, Calabria on the mainland was also probably an early center of Christianity.[60]\\r\\nAccording to Acts, Paul was shipwrecked and ministered on an island which some scholars have identified as Malta (an island just south of Sicily) for three months during which time he is said to have been bitten by a poisonous viper and survived (Acts 27:39ÿ42; Acts 28:1ÿ11), an event usually dated c. AD 60. Paul had been allowed passage from Caesarea Maritima to Rome by Porcius Festus, procurator of Iudaea Province, to stand trial before the Emperor. Many traditions are associated with this episode, and catacombs in Rabat testify to an Early Christian community on the islands. According to tradition, Publius, the Roman Governor of Malta at the time of Saint Paul's shipwreck, became the first Bishop of Malta following his conversion to Christianity. After ruling the Maltese Church for thirty-one years, Publius was transferred to the See of Athens in 90 AD, where he was martyred in 125 AD. There is scant information about the continuity of Christianity in Malta in subsequent years, although tradition has it that there was a continuous line of bishops from the days of St. Paul to the time of Emperor Constantine.\\r\\nSalona, the capital of the Roman province of Dalmatia on the eastern shore of the Adriatic Sea, was an early center of Christianity and today is a ruin in modern Croatia. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia it was where: \\"...Titus the pupil of St. Paul preached, where the followers of Jesus Christ first shed their blood as martyrs, and where beautiful examples of basilicas and other early Christian sculpture have been discovered.\\" According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article on Dalmatia: \\"Salona became the centre from which Christianity spread. In Pannonia St. Andronicus founded the See of Syrmium (Mitrovica) and later those of Siscia and Mursia. The cruel persecution under Diocletian, who was a Dalmatian by birth, left numerous traces in Old Dalmatia and Pannonia. St. Quirinus, Bishop of Siscia, died a martyr A.D. 303. St. Jerome was born in Strido, a city on the border of Pannonia and Dalmatia.\\"\\r\\nSeville was the capital of Hispania Baetica or the Roman province of southern Spain. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"...the origin of the diocese goes back to Apostolic times, or at least to the first century of our era. St. Gerontius, Bishop of Italica (about four miles from Hispalis or Seville), preached in Baetica in Apostolic times, and without doubt must have left a pastor of its own to Seville. It is certain that in 303, when Sts. Justa and Rufina, the potters, suffered martyrdom for refusing to adore the idol Salambo, there was a Bishop of Seville, Sabinus, who assisted at the Council of Illiberis (287). Before that time Marcellus had been bishop, as appears from a catalogue of the ancient prelates of Seville preserved in the 'Codex Emilianensis', a manuscript of the year 1000, now in the Escorial. When Constantine brought peace to the Church [313] Evodius was Bishop of Seville; he set himself to rebuild the ruined churches, among them he appears to have built the church of San Vicente, perhaps the first cathedral of Seville.\\" Early Christianity also spread from the Iberian peninsula south across the Strait of Gibraltar into Roman Mauretania Tingitana, of note is Marcellus of Tangier who was martyred in 298.\\r\\nChristianity reached Roman Britain by the third century of the Christian era, the first recorded martyrs in Britain being St. Alban of Verulamium and Julius and Aaron of Caerleon, during the reign of Diocletian (284ÿ305). Gildas dated the faith's arrival to the latter part of the reign of Tiberius, although stories connecting it with Joseph of Arimathea, Lucius, or Fagan are now generally considered pious forgeries. Restitutus, Bishop of London, is recorded as attending the 314 Council of Arles, along with the Bishop of Lincoln and Bishop of York.\\r\\nChristianisation intensified and evolved into Celtic Christianity after the Romans left Britain c. 410.\\r\\nChristianity was by no means confined to the Roman Empire during the early Christian period.\\r\\nNew evidence suggests that Ethiopia was the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion.[61][62] According to records written in the Ge'ez language, see also Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the region today known as Ethiopia converted to Judaism during the time of the biblical Queen of Sheba and Solomon. According to the fourth century western historian Rufinius, it was Frumentius who brought Christianity to Ethiopia (the city of Axum) and served as its first bishop, probably shortly after 325.[63]\\r\\nScholars have long asserted that Armenia became the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion. It is said that Christianity became the official religion of Armenia in 301,[64] when it was still illegal in the Roman Empire. According to church tradition,[citation needed] the Armenian Apostolic Church was founded by Gregory the Illuminator of the late third ÿ early fourth centuries while they trace their origins to the missions of Bartholomew the Apostle and Thaddeus (Jude the Apostle) in the 1st century. Although it has long been claimed that Armenia was the first Christian kingdom, this has relied on a source by Agathangelos titled \\"The History of the Armenians\\", which has recently been redated, casting some doubt.[61]\\r\\nChristianity in Georgia (ancient Iberia) extends back to the 4th century, if not earlier.[65] The Iberian king, Mirian III, converted to Christianity, probably in 326.[65]\\r\\nEdessa, which was held by Rome from 116 to 118 and 212 to 214, but was mostly a client kingdom associated either with Rome or Persia, was an important Christian city. Shortly after 201 or even earlier, its royal house became Christian[66]\\r\\nEdessa (now ?anl?urfa) in northwestern Mesopotamia was from apostolic times the principal center of Syriac-speaking Christianity. it was the capital of an independent kingdom from 132 BC to AD 216, when it became tributary to Rome. Celebrated as an important centre of Greco-Syrian culture, Edessa was also noted for its Jewish community, with proselytes in the royal family. Strategically located on the main trade routes of the Fertile Crescent, it was easily accessible from Antioch, where the mission to the Gentiles was inaugurated. When early Christians were scattered abroad because of persecution, some found refuge at Edessa. Thus the Edessan church traced its origin to the apostolic age (which may account for its rapid growth), and Christianity even became the state religion for a time.\\r\\nThe Church of the East had its inception at a very early date in the buffer zone between the Parthian and Roman Empires in Upper Mesopotamia, known as the Assyrian Church of the East. The vicissitudes of its later growth were rooted in its minority status in a situation of international tension. The rulers of the Parthian Empire (250 BC ÿ AD 226) were on the whole tolerant in spirit, and with the older faiths of Babylonia and Assyria in a state of decay, the time was ripe for a new and vital faith. The rulers of the Second Persian empire (226ÿ640) also followed a policy of religious toleration to begin with, though later they gave Christians the same status as a subject race. However, these rulers also encouraged the revival of the ancient Persian dualistic faith of Zoroastrianism and established it as the state religion, with the result that the Christians were increasingly subjected to repressive measures. Nevertheless, it was not until Christianity became the state religion in the West (380) that enmity toward Rome was focused on the Eastern Christians. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, the caliphate tolerated other faiths but forbade proselytism and subjected Christians to heavy taxation.\\r\\nThe missionary Addai evangelized Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) about the middle of the 2nd century. An ancient legend recorded by Eusebius (AD 260ÿ340) and also found in the Doctrine of Addai (c. AD 400) (from information in the royal archives of Edessa) describes how King Abgar V of Edessa communicated to Jesus, requesting he come and heal him, to which appeal he received a reply. It is said that after the resurrection, the Thomas sent Addai (or Thaddaeus), to the king, with the result that the city was won to the Christian faith. In this mission he was accompanied by a disciple, Mari, and the two are regarded as co-founders of the church, according to the Liturgy of Addai and Mari (c. AD 200), which is still the normal liturgy of the Assyrian church. The Doctrine of Addai further states that Thomas was regarded as an apostle of the church in Edessa.[2][3]\\r\\nAddai, who became the first bishop of Edessa, was succeeded by Aggai, then by Palut, who was ordained about 200 by Serapion of Antioch. Thence came to us in the 2nd century the famous Peshitta, or Syriac translation of the Old Testament; also Tatian's Diatessaron, which was compiled about 172 and in common use until St. Rabbula, Bishop of Edessa (412ÿ435), forbade its use. This arrangement of the four Canonical gospels as a continuous narrative, whose original language may have been Syriac, Greek, or even Latin, circulated widely in Syriac-speaking Churches.[67]\\r\\nA Christian council was held at Edessa as early as 197.[68] In 201 the city was devastated by a great flood, and the Christian church was destroyed.[69] In 232, the Syriac Acts were written supposedly on the event of the relics of the Apostle Thomas being handed to the church in Edessa. Under Roman domination many martyrs suffered at Edessa: Sts. Scharb?l and Barsamya, under Decius; Sts. G?rja, Scham?na, Habib, and others under Diocletian. In the meanwhile Christian priests from Edessa had evangelized Eastern Mesopotamia and Persia, and established the first Churches in the kingdom of the Sasanians.[70] Atillatia, Bishop of Edessa, assisted at the First Council of Nicaea (325).\\r\\nBy the latter half of the 2nd century, Christianity had spread east throughout Media, Persia, Parthia, and Bactria. The twenty bishops and many presbyters were more of the order of itinerant missionaries, passing from place to place as Paul did and supplying their needs with such occupations as merchant or craftsman. By AD 280 the metropolis of Seleucia assumed the title of \\"Catholicos\\" and in A.D. 424 a council of the church at Seleucia elected the first patriarch to have jurisdiction over the whole church of the East. The seat of the Patriarchate was fixed at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, since this was an important point on the East-West trade routes which extended both to India and China, Java and Japan. Thus the shift of ecclesiastical authority was away from Edessa, which in A.D. 216 had become tributary to Rome. the establishment of an independent patriarchate with nine subordinate metropoli contributed to a more favourable attitude by the Persian government, which no longer had to fear an ecclesiastical alliance with the common enemy, Rome.\\r\\nBy the time that Edessa was incorporated into the Persian Empire in 258, the city of Arbela, situated on the Tigris in what is now Iraq, had taken on more and more the role that Edessa had played in the early years, as a centre from which Christianity spread to the rest of the Persian Empire.[71]\\r\\nBardaisan, writing about 196, speaks of Christians throughout Media, Parthia and Bactria (modern-day Afghanistan)[72] and, according to Tertullian (c. 160ÿ230), there were already a number of bishoprics within the Persian Empire by 220.[71] By 315, the bishop of SeleuciaÿCtesiphon had assumed the title \\"Catholicos\\".[71] By this time, neither Edessa nor Arbela was the centre of the Church of the East anymore; ecclesiastical authority had moved east to the heart of the Persian Empire.[71] The twin cities of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, well-situated on the main trade routes between East and West, became, in the words of John Stewart, \\"a magnificent centre for the missionary church that was entering on its great task of carrying the gospel to the far east\\".[73]\\r\\nWhen Constantine converted to Christianity, and the Roman Empire which was previously violently anti-Christian became pro-Christian, the Persian Empire, suspecting a new \\"enemy within\\", became violently anti-Christian. Within a few years, Shapur II (309ÿ379) inaugurated a twenty-year-long persecution of the church with the murder of Mar Shimun, the Catholicos of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, five bishops and 100 priests on Good Friday, 344, after the Patriarch refused to collect a double tax from the Christians to help the Persian war effort against Rome.[71] See also Christianity in Iran.\\r\\nTo understand the penetration of the Arabian peninsula by the Christian gospel, it is helpful to distinguish between the Bedouin nomads of the interior, who were chiefly herdsmen and unreceptive to foreign control, and the inhabitants of the settled communities of the coastal areas and oases, who were either middlemen traders or farmers and were receptive to influences from abroad. Christianity apparently gained its strongest foothold in the ancient center of Semitic civilization in South-west Arabia or Yemen, (sometimes known as Seba or Sheba, whose queen visited Solomon). Because of geographic proximity, acculturation with Ethiopia was always strong, and the royal family traces its ancestry to this queen.\\r\\nThe presence of Arabians at Pentecost and Paul's three-year sojourn in Arabia suggest a very early gospel witness. A 4th-century church history, states that the apostle Bartholomew preached in Arabia and that Himyarites were among his converts. The Al-Jubail Church in what is now Saudi Arabia was built in the 4th century. Arabia's close relations with Ethiopia give significance to the conversion of the treasurer to the queen of Ethiopia, not to mention the tradition that the Apostle Matthew was assigned to this land.[4] Eusebius says that \\"one Pantaneous (c. A.D. 190) was sent from Alexandria as a missionary to the nations of the East\\", including southwest Arabia, on his way to India.[5]\\r\\nChristianity arrived early in Nubia. In the New Testament of the Christian Bible, a treasury official of \\"Candace, queen of the Ethiopians\\" returning from a trip to Jerusalem was baptised by Philip the Evangelist:\\r\\nEthiopia at that time meant any upper Nile region. Candace was the name and perhaps, title for the Mero? or Kushite queens.\\r\\nIn the fourth century, bishop Athanasius of Alexandria consecrated Marcus as bishop of Philae before his death in 373, showing that Christianity had permanently penetrated the region. John of Ephesus records that a Monophysite priest named Julian converted the king and his nobles of Nobatia around 545 and another kingdom of Alodia converted around 569. By the 7th century Makuria expanded becoming the dominant power in the region so strong enough to halt the southern expansion of Islam after the Arabs had taken Egypt. After several failed invasions the new rulers agreed to a treaty with Dongola allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade. This treaty held for six hundred years allowing Arab traders introducing Islam to Nubia and it gradually supplanted Christianity. The last record of a bishop is at Qasr Ibrim in 1372.","input":"Where did christianity originate rome egypt judea greece?"},{"output":"Washington Capitals","context":"The 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL).

Matt Calvert scored the game-winning goal for Columbus as they took a 2ÿ0 series lead.[23] The Capitals took game three 3ÿ2 in double-overtime as Lars Eller scored the game winner.[24] The Capitals tied the series after game four as Washington's Alexander Ovechkin had a goal and an assist in a 4ÿ1 victory.[25] Nicklas Backstrom's tip-in was the overtime-winner for the Capitals in game five as they prevented a two-goal comeback by the Blue Jackets.[26] In game six, Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin scored twice to seal the series for Washington, winning the affair 6ÿ3.[27] With playoff series victories by Winnipeg and Vegas this season, Columbus is now the only NHL franchise without a playoff series win.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins finished second in the Metropolitan Division earning 100 points. The Philadelphia Flyers earned 98 points to finish third in the Metropolitan. This was the seventh playoff meeting between these two rivals with Philadelphia winning four of the six previous series. They last met in the 2012 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals, which Philadelphia won in six games. Pittsburgh won all four games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Penguins defeated the Flyers in six games.

The Colorado Avalanche finished as the Western Conference's second wild card earning 95 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Nashville won all four games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Predators defeated the Avalanche in six games. Filip Forsberg scored twice in Nashville's 5ÿ2 game one victory, one of which was considered a highlight-reel goal.[35][36] Nashville had five different players score in their 5ÿ4 victory over Colorado in game two to take a 2ÿ0 series lead.[37]Nathan MacKinnon scored twice and Gabriel Landeskog had a goal and two assists in game three to take game three for the Avalanche 5ÿ3.[38] In game four, Pekka Rinne made 31 saves for the Predators who took a 3ÿ1 series lead with a 3ÿ2 win.[39] Andrew Hammond made 44 saves and Sven Andrighetto scored with 1:28 left in the third period to force a sixth game for the Avalanche in a 2ÿ1 triumph.[40] The Predators shut out the Avalanche in game six, with Rinne stopping all 22 shots he faced in a 5ÿ0 victory.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Winnipeg Jets finished second in the Central Division earning 114 points.

Winnipeg won three of the four games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Jets defeated the Wild in five games and earned their first playoff series victory in franchise history after entering the league in 1999 as the Atlanta Thrashers. The Jets also became the first Winnipeg-based NHL team to advance past the opening round of the playoffs since 1987. After firing 40 shots on Minnesota goaltender Devan Dubnyk, the Jets won game one 3ÿ2, winning their first playoff game in franchise history and the city's first playoff victory since 1996.[42] In game two, Patrik Laine had a goal and an assist to provide the Jets a 4ÿ1 victory as well as a 2ÿ0 series lead.[43] In game three, the Wild scored four goals in the second period to chase Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck in a 6ÿ2 affair.[44] Hellebuyck came back in game four, stopping all 30 shots he faced in a 2ÿ0 victory.[45] Hellebuyck continued his shutout streak in game five, stopping another 30 shots after a first period blitz by the Jets to win the series-clinching game 5ÿ0.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Vegas Golden Knights finished first in the Pacific Division earning 109 points. The Los Angeles Kings earned 98 points to finish as the Western Conference's first wild card. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams and the first playoff series for the Golden Knights. These teams split their four-game regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Knights defeated the Kings in a four-game sweep. In game one, Marc-Andre Fleury stopped all 30 shots to give the Golden Knights their first playoff victory.[47] Even though Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick made 54 saves in game two, the Golden Knights topped Los Angeles in double overtime thanks to Erik Haula's goal at 15:23, taking a 2ÿ0 series lead.[48] After the Golden Knights took the lead late in the third period of game three with two goals in 21 seconds Vegas pushed the Kings to the brink of elimination with a 3ÿ2 win; Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury made 37 saves in the victory.[49] In game four, former-King Brayden McNabb scored the only goal of the game for the Golden Knights as they swept Los Angeles for their first playoff series victory.[50] This series tied the record for the fewest number of goals scored by both teams in a best-of-seven playoff series: the Golden Knights scored seven goals to the Kings' three goals for a total of ten goals, tying the record set in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Anaheim Ducks finished second in the Pacific Division earning 101 points. The San Jose Sharks earned 100 points to finish third in the Pacific Division. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams.

Marchand received no penalty or further punishment from the League.[59] The Lightning scored twice in the second period of game five to take the lead and Anton Stralman scored an empty-net goal to give Tampa Bay a 3ÿ1 victory and a 4ÿ1 series win.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the third consecutive year that these two rivals have met in the second round and was the eleventh overall playoff meeting with Pittsburgh winning nine of the ten previous series. They last met in the previous year's Eastern Conference Second Round which Pittsburgh won in seven games. These teams split their four-game regular season series. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitals defeated the Penguins in six games, defeating Pittsburgh for the second time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.

They last met in the 2011 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which Tampa Bay won in a four-game sweep. Also since 2011, this was the first conference final between two division champions. This is the Lightning's fifth appearance in the Conference Finals, and their third in the last four seasons.[80] Tampa Bay last went to the Conference Finals in 2016; they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games. This is Washington's third Conference Finals appearance. They last made the Conference Finals in 1998; they defeated the Buffalo Sabres in six games. Tampa Bay won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Capitals defeated the Lightning in seven games. In game one, Washington scored four consecutive goals across the first two periods forcing Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper to pull goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy; the Capitals won 4ÿ2.[81] Lars Eller and Evgeny Kuznetsov had a goal and two assists in Washington's 6ÿ2 triumph in game two.[82] The Lightning struck back in game three as Victor Hedman potted a goal and two assists in Tampa's 4ÿ2 victory.[83]Andrei Vasilevskiy made 36 saves in game four as the Lightning won the game 4ÿ2 and thus tied the series.[84] In game five, Ryan Callahan had a goal and an assist for the Lightning as they hung on for 3ÿ2 victory.[85] In game six, Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby made 24 saves in a 3ÿ0 shutout victory to force a seventh game.[86] Braden Holtby stopped all 29 shots and Andre Burakovsky scored twice in game seven for Washington, advancing the Capitals to the Finals for the first time since 1998 in a 4ÿ0 victory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. This was the first time since 2003 where two teams were making their Conference Finals debut. The Jets advanced to the Conference Finals for the first time in their 18th season (seventh in Winnipeg) after entering the league in 1999 as the Atlanta Thrashers; they also became the first Winnipeg-based team in league history to make it past the second round. Vegas made the Conference Finals in their inaugural season becoming the first expansion team since the St. Louis Blues in 1968 to advance past the second round of the playoffs. Vegas won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Golden Knights defeated the Jets in five games. In game one, Mark Scheifele scored a goal and recorded an assist in a 4ÿ2 triumph over the Golden Knights.[87] Jonathan Marchessault scored twice in Vegas' bounce-back win in game two, evening the series after a 3ÿ1 victory.[88] Marc-Andre Fleury made 33 saves for Vegas, including 15 in the third period of game three, to take a 4ÿ2 victory.[89] Fleury made an additional 35 saves in game four with Vegas forward Reilly Smith scoring the game-winning goal 13:02 into the third period.[90] In game five, the Golden Knights held onto a 2ÿ1 lead, after Ryan Reaves scored in the second period to break the tie, to win the game and became the first expansion team to move onto the Stanley Cup Finals since the St. Louis Blues in 1968.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Vegas was making their Finals debut in their inaugural season, becoming the first team since the aforementioned St. Louis Blues to make the Finals in their first season. Washington made their second Finals appearance. Their only previous appearance in the Finals ended in a four-game sweep by the Detroit Red Wings in 1998. This was the first Finals since 2007 to feature two teams that had not previously won a Stanley Cup. Vegas won both games in this year's regular season series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the seventh postseason under NBC Sports' current 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games was aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. Due to original programming commitments involving CNBC and USA Network, two first round games on April 18 were aired by Golf Channel.[94][95][96] During the first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rights holders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games. For the second year, the first round national broadcasts were not blacked out on television in the markets of participating teams, and could co-exist with the local broadcasts (however, NBC-provided coverage was restricted in Pittsburgh and Las Vegas, where AT&T SportsNet holds the regional rights to the Penguins and the Golden Knights, respectively).[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, for the fourth postseason under Rogers Media's current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast by Sportsnet networks and CBC Television under the Hockey Night in Canada brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL Live.[98] The Winnipeg Jets' first round series against the Minnesota Wild was relegated to Sportsnet, due to the Maple Leafs' series being given priority, and to encourage subscription to the network since it is not carried on basic cable in Winnipeg.[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a surprise move, Sportsnet did not give any on-air assignments to Bob Cole during the playoffsan exclusion that caught the veteran commentator off-guard. Instead, Sportsnet replaced Cole with Calgary Flames announcer Rick Ball, joining Jim Hughson, Paul Romanuk and Dave Randorf on play-by-play during the first two rounds of the playoffs.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nFuelled by viewer interest in the Golden Knights' inaugural season and playoff run, and in Canada, the deep playoff run of the Winnipeg Jets, viewership of these playoffs saw noticeable increases. NBC reported that viewership of the conference finals collectively saw a 15% increase over 2017, with an average viewership across broadcast, cable, and streaming platforms (\\"total audience delivery\\")[102] of 1.841 million (23% increase year-over-year) for the Western Conference finals featuring the Golden Knights, game one of said series (televised on NBC) seen by 2.374 viewers total, and game seven of the Lightning/Capitals Eastern Conference final pulling a 2.14 overnight ratingthe highest viewership for a non-overtime game seven since 2015, and the highest cable viewership of the 2018 playoffs to-date.[103] The Jets also contributed to strong viewership numbers in Canada, with Sportsnet reporting an average of 2.2 million across their second-round series.[104][105][106]","input":"What teams are in the stanley cup playiffs?"},{"output":"early 15th century","context":"The first European colonization wave took place from the early 15th century (Portuguese conquest of Ceuta in 1415) until the early 19th-century (French invasion of Algeria in 1830), and primarily involved the European colonization of the Americas, though it also included the establishment of European colonies in India and in Maritime Southeast Asia. During this period, European interests in Africa primarily focused on the establishment of trading posts there, particularly for the African slave trade.\\r\\nThe time period in which much of the first wave of European colonization (and other exploratory ventures) occurred is often labeled the Age of Discovery. A later major phase of European colonization, which started in the late 19th-century and primarily focused on Africa and Asia, is known as the period of New Imperialism.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious zeal played a large role in Spanish and Portuguese overseas activities. While the Pope himself was a political power to be heeded (as evidenced by his authority to decree whole continents open to colonization by particular kings), the Church also sent missionaries to convert the indigenous peoples of other continents to the Catholic faith. Thus, the 1455 Papal Bull Romanus Pontifex granted the Portuguese all lands behind Cape Bojador and allowed them to reduce pagans and other enemies of Christ to perpetual slavery.[1]\\r\\nLater, the 1481 Papal Bull Aeterni regis granted all lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal, while in May 1493 the Spanish-born Pope Alexander VI decreed in the Bull Inter caetera that all lands west of a meridian only 100 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Spain while new lands discovered east of that line would belong to Portugal. These arrangements were later precised with the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas.\\r\\nThe Dominicans and Jesuits, notably Francis Xavier in Asia, were particularly active in this endeavour. Many buildings erected by the Jesuits still stand, such as the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Macau and the Santisima Trinidad de Paran in Paraguay, an example of a Jesuit Reduction.\\r\\nSpanish treatment of the indigenous populations provoked a fierce debate at home in 1550ÿ51, dubbed the Valladolid debate, over whether Indians possessed souls and if so, whether they were entitled to the basic rights of mankind. Bartolom de Las Casas, author of A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, championed the cause of the natives, and was opposed by Sep~lveda, who claimed Amerindians were \\"natural slaves\\".\\r\\nThe School of Salamanca, which gathered theologians such as Francisco de Vitoria (1480ÿ1546) or Francisco Surez (1548ÿ1617), argued in favor of the existence of natural law, which thus gave some rights to indigenous people. However, while the School of Salamanca limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also legitimized the conquest, defining the conditions of \\"Just War\\". For example, these theologians admitted the existence of the right for indigenous people to reject religious conversion, which was a novelty for Western philosophical thought. However, Surez also conceived many particular cases  a casuistry  in which conquest was legitimized. Hence, war was justified if the indigenous people refused free transit and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Surez, and for the advantage of the Indians. Henceforth, the School of Salamanca legitimized the conquest while at the same time limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the notion of the divine right of kings.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the Jesuits would become a main proponent of the Liberation theology which openly supported anti-imperialist movements. It was officially condemned in 1984 and in 1986 by then Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) as the head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, under charges of Marxist tendencies, while Leonardo Boff was suspended.\\r\\nIt was not long before the exclusivity of Iberian claims to the Americas was challenged by other European powers, primarily the Netherlands, France and England: the view taken by the rulers of these nations is epitomized by the quotation attributed to Francis I of France demanding to be shown the clause in Adam's will excluding his authority from the New World.\\r\\nThis challenge initially took the form of privateering raids (such as that led by Francis Drake) on Spanish treasure fleets or coastal settlements, but later, Northern European countries began establishing settlements of their own, primarily in areas that were outside of Spanish interests, such as what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada, or islands in the Caribbean, such as Aruba, Martinique and Barbados, that had been abandoned by the Spanish in favour of the mainland and larger islands.\\r\\nWhereas Spanish colonialism was based on the religious conversion and exploitation of local populations via encomiendas (many Spaniards emigrated to the Americas to elevate their social status, and were not interested in manual labour), Northern European colonialism was frequently bolstered by people fleeing religious persecution or intolerance (for example, the Mayflower voyage). The motive for emigration was not to become an aristocrat nor to spread one's faith but to start afresh in a new society, where life would be hard but one would be free to exercise one's religious beliefs. The most populous emigration of the 17th century was that of the English, and after a series of wars with the Dutch and the French the English overseas possessions came to dominate the east coast of North America, an area stretching from Virginia northwards to New England and Newfoundland, although during the 17th century an even greater number of English emigrants settled in the West Indies.\\r\\nHowever, the English, French and Dutch were no more averse to making a profit than the Spanish and Portuguese, and whilst their areas of settlement in the Americas proved to be devoid of the precious metals found by the Spanish, trade in other commodities and products that could be sold at massive profit in Europe provided another reason for crossing the Atlantic, in particular furs from Canada, tobacco and cotton grown in Virginia and sugar in the islands of the Caribbean and Brazil. Due to the massive depletion of indigenous labour, plantation owners had to look elsewhere for manpower for these labour-intensive crops. They turned to the centuries-old slave trade of west Africa and began transporting humans across the Atlantic on a massive scale ÿ historians estimate that the Atlantic slave trade brought between 10 and 12 million individuals to the New World. The islands of the Caribbean soon came to be populated by slaves of African descent, ruled over by a white minority of plantation owners interested in making a fortune and then returning to their home country to spend it.\\r\\nThe January 27, 1512 Leyes de Burgos codified the government of the indigenous people of the New World, since the common law of Spain wasn't applied in these recently discovered territories. The scope of the laws were originally restricted to the island of Hispaniola, but were later extended to Puerto Rico and Jamaica. They authorized and legalized the colonial practice of creating encomiendas, where Indians were grouped together to work under colonial masters, limiting the size of these establishments to a minimum of 40 and a maximum of 150 people. The document finally prohibited the use of any form of punishment by the encomenderos, reserving it for officials established in each town for the implementation of the laws. It also ordered that the Indians be catechesized, outlawed bigamy, and required that the huts and cabins of the Indians be built together with those of the Spanish. It respected, in some ways, the traditional authorities, granting chiefs exemptions from ordinary jobs and granting them various Indians as servants. The poor fulfilment of the laws in many cases lead to inummerable protests and claims. In fact, the laws were so often poorly applied that they were seen as simply a legalization of the previous poor situation. This would create momentum for reform, carried out through the Leyes Nuevas (\\"New Laws\\") in 1542. Ten years later, Dominican friar Bartolom de las Casas would publish A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, in the midst of the Valladolid Controversy, a debate about the existence or not of souls in Amerindians bodies. Las Casas, bishop of Chiapas, was opposed to Sep~lveda, who claimed Amerindians were \\"natural slaves\\"...\\r\\nIn the French empire, slave trade and other colonial rules were regulated by Louis XIV's 1689 Code Noir.\\r\\nFrom its very outset, Western colonialism was operated as a joint public-private venture. Columbus' voyages to the Americas were partially funded by Italian investors, but whereas the Spanish state maintained a tight rein on trade with its colonies (by law, the colonies could only trade with one designated port in the mother country and treasure was brought back in special convoys), the English, French and Dutch granted what were effectively trade monopolies to joint-stock companies such as the East India Companies and the Hudson's Bay Company. The Massachusetts Bay Company, founded in 1628/9, swiftly established a form of self-governance following the Cambridge Agreement of August 1629, whereby subsequent meetings of the board of governors took place in Massachusetts itself.\\r\\nIn 1498, the Portuguese arrived in Goa. Rivalry among reigning European powers saw the entry of the Dutch, British, French, Danish among others. The fractured debilitated kingdoms of India were gradually taken over by the Europeans and indirectly controlled by puppet rulers. In 1600, Queen Elizabeth I accorded a charter, forming the East India Company to trade with India and eastern Asia. The British landed in India in Surat in 1624. By the 19th century, they had assumed direct and indirect control over most of India.\\r\\nThe arrival of the conquistadores caused the annihilation of most of the Amerindians. However, contemporary historians now generally reject the Black Legend according to which the brutality of the European colonists accounted for most of the deaths. It is now generally believed that diseases, such as the smallpox, brought upon by the Columbian Exchange, were the greatest destroyer, although the brutality of the conquest itself isn't contested. Genocidal policies were more common in post-colonial states, notably in 19th century United States and Argentina where indigenous populations were systematically exterminated. For example, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Argentinian caudillo from 1829 to 1852, openly pursued the extermination of the local population, an event related by Darwin in The Voyage of the Beagle (1839). He was then followed by the \\"Conquest of the Desert\\" in the 1870ÿ80s. The result was the death of a lot of the mapuche and arauccan population in the Patagonia. After the Amerindians' quasi-total disparition, the mines and the sugar cane plantations thus led to the booming of the Atlantic slave trade, especially apparent in the Caribbean where the largest ethnic group is of African descent.\\r\\nContemporary historians debate the legitimacy of calling the quasi-disparition of the Amerindians a \\"genocide\\". Estimates of pre-Columbian population have ranged from a low of 8.4 million to a high of 112.5 million persons; in 1976, geographer William Denevan derived a \\"consensus count\\" of about 54 million people.[2]\\r\\nDavid Stannard has argued that \\"The destruction of the Indians of the Americas was, far and away, the most massive act of genocide in the history of the world\\", with almost 100 million Amerindians killed in what he calls the American Holocaust. Like Ward Churchill, he believes that the American natives were deliberately and systematically exterminated over the course of several centuries, and that the process continues to the present day.[3]\\r\\nStannard's claim of 100 million deaths has been disputed because he makes no distinction between death from violence and death from disease. In response, political scientist R. J. Rummel has instead estimated that over the centuries of European colonization about 2 million to 15 million American indigenous people were the victims of what he calls democide. \\"Even if these figures are remotely true\\", writes Rummel, \\"then this still make this subjugation of the Americas one of the bloodier, centuries long, democides in world history.\\" [4]\\r\\nSpain and Portugal sought the utilization of foreign and indigenous peoples during post colonial contact with the New World. The Portuguese and Spanish use of slavery in Latin America was seen as a lucrative business which ultimately led to internal and external development in gaining economic influence at any cost. The economic pursuits of the Spanish and Portuguese empires ushered in the era of the Atlantic Slave Trade.\\r\\nIn the fifteenth century, Portugal shifted its attention to the latter economic endeavor. Their ships sailed from the borders of the Sahara desert to the entirety of the West African coast.[5]:33 At the outset of the Atlantic Slave Trade, Manuel Bautista Prez, a notable Portuguese slave trader, gives insight to the amount and treatment of the African slaves. Prez and his men conducted slave trading in which thousands of African peoples were bought from local tribal leaders and transported across the Atlantic to South America. In contrast from popular belief, Portuguese slave traders did not acquire slaves in a forceful manner. According to documents written by Manuel Prez, slaves were only made available by certain conditions. The most notable condition was bartering items that the leaders wanted and were interested in.[5]:39 Items such as bread, coal, precious stones, and firearms were provided in exchange for slaves. Furthermore, local tribal leaders did not simply give up their own people for the aforementioned commodities but rather through intertribal wars, debts, and civil crime offenders.[5]:54\\r\\nLabor in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies became scarce. European diseases and forced labor began killing the indigenous people in insurmountable numbers. Therefore, slaves were seen only as a business venture due to the labor shortages. These slaves were forced to work in jobs such as agriculture and mining. According to David Eltis, areas controlled by the Spanish such as Mexico, Peru, and large parts of Central America used forced slave labor in \\"mining activities\\".[6] In 1494 the Pope ushered in the Treaty of Tordesillas, granting Spain and Portugal two separate parts of the world.[7] Due to this treaty, Portugal had the monopoly on acquiring the slaves from Africa. However, Spain, like Portugal, needed the labor force to pursue their personal economic gains.[5]:20 This gave Portugal an increased revenue stream. African slaves were sold to the Spanish colonies through an internal reform known as the asiento; which gave the right, by the Spanish Crown, for acquiring African slaves from the Portuguese traders.\\r\\nIn terms of the treatment of slaves, Portuguese external policies on the acquisition of slaves depict a malicious attempt to obtaining economic wealth. Nearly 3,600 slaves a year were traded by a single trader.[5]:68 This latter statement illuminates that traders tried to get as many slaves as they could in the shortest amount of time. Consequently, this led to the deaths of thousands of African peoples. Newly bought slaves were kept tightly packed in highly flammable huts in order to wait for transport. Once aboard the ships many hundreds of people would once again be shoved into lower ship compartments, collectively chained up, and given little to eat. By these actions \\"nearly a quarter of the slaves transported died before ever reaching the destination\\".[5]:72 Many of them suffocated in the lower compartments as the hatches upon the deck remained closed; restricting the circulation of air. Slaves were often branded with a mark upon their skin to identify either the ship they arrived on or the company that purchased them. In addition, the slaves were seen as a \\"potentially economic utility\\"; therefore they were often equated to cattle when moved about.[8] Many African people died in large numbers in order to meet the demand for Spanish and Portuguese labor requirements.\\r\\nBoth Spain and Portugal share a similar history in regards to the treatment of slaves in their colonies. As time progressed and new generations of slaves lived under imperial rule, Spanish and Portuguese internal reforms dealt with African slaves in areas such as, \\"the purchasing and selling of slaves, legal ownership, succession upon death of owner, the rights of slaves to buy their liberty, and penalties to those who ran away\\".[9] There was a constant strict social control amongst the slave population. Nevertheless, the goal was to create and sustain a labor force that would yield maximum economic output. The lucrative business the Portuguese sought on the West African coast ushered in an era in which human labor, at any cost, was used for the extraction of wealth.","input":"When did the first wave of western settlement began?"},{"output":"November 5, 2017","context":"A mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of the city of San Antonio, on November 5, 2017.[1] The gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley of nearby New Braunfels, killed 26 and injured 20 others. He was shot twice by a male civilian as he exited the church. Fleeing in his SUV, Kelley crashed after a high-speed chase and was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds, including a self-inflicted head shot.\\r\\nThe attack was the deadliest mass shooting in Texas and the fifth-deadliest mass shooting in the United States.[2] It was the deadliest shooting in an American place of worship in modern history, surpassing the Charleston church shooting of 2015[3] and the Waddell Buddhist temple shooting of 1991.[4]\\r\\nKelley was prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing firearms and ammunition due to a domestic violence conviction in a court-martial while in the United States Air Force. The Air Force failed to record the conviction in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Crime Information Center database, which is used by the National Instant Check System to flag prohibited purchases. The error prompted the Air Force to begin a review.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA few minutes after 11 a.m. CST, on November 5, 2017, Devin Patrick Kelley arrived in his pearl white Ford Explorer SUV at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs. He parked close to the door, in a spot vacated by a parishioner who had left the Sunday services early.[citation needed]\\r\\nAbout 11:20?a.m., Kelley stepped out of the SUV, wearing black tactical gear, a ballistic vest, and a black face-mask featuring a white skull,[6] and wielding a Ruger AR-556 semi-automatic rifle. He approached the church from the right, opening fire on and killing two people outside the church and continuing to fire on the building itself. He then entered through a right side door, where worshipers were attending regular Sunday service.[citation needed]\\r\\nInside, he yelled, \\"Everybody die, motherfuckers,\\" as he proceeded up and down the aisle and shot at people in the pews.[6][7] Police found 15 empty magazines capable of holding 30 rounds each.[8][9][10] According to investigators, the shooting was captured on a camera set up at the back of the church to record regular services for uploading online. The footage shows Kelley methodically shooting the victims, pausing only to reload his rifle.[11]\\r\\nAs Kelley left the church, he was confronted by and traded fire with Stephen Willeford, a local resident and former NRA firearms instructor[12] who was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Willeford had taken cover behind a truck across the street from the church and shot Kelley twice, once in the leg and in the upper left torso under his tactical gear.[13][14][15] Kelley, who had dropped his rifle upon the initial fire with Willeford, fired back with a handgun before fleeing in his Ford Explorer. Willeford fired one more round as Kelley sped north on FM 539.[16][17] He then noticed a pickup truck parked at the intersection of 4th St. and FM 539, driven by Johnnie Langendorff.\\r\\nWilleford approached and entered Langendorff's truck on the passenger side. They then pursued Kelley at high speed for about five to seven minutes. According to Langendorff, they drove at speeds up to 95 miles per hour (155?km/h).[18] While chasing Kelley, Langendorff called 9-1-1 and reported their location to the operator as they assumed that the police were on their way to the church.\\r\\nDuring the chase, Kelley called his father to tell him that he was injured and thought that he would not survive.[15] Bleeding from his injuries, Kelley lost control of his vehicle, hitting a road sign before crossing a bar ditch at the Hartfield/Sandy Elm Road intersection and finally stopping about 30 feet into the field on the opposite side.\\r\\nWilleford and Langendorff observed that he was motionless, and police took over the scene when they arrived.[19] Police found Kelley dead in his car[20] with three gunshot wounds, including a self-inflicted head wound.[21] Two handguns were found in the vehicle: a Glock 9 mm and a Ruger .22-caliber, both of which Kelley had purchased.[22]\\r\\nThe Texas Rangers are leading the investigation, and the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are assisting.[20] Investigators said the shooting was not motivated by racism or prejudice against religion, but by a dispute with Kelley's mother-in-law.[23] There was no indication that anyone other than Kelley was involved in the shooting.[11]\\r\\nKelley carried an iPhone with him during the attack, which investigators are unable to unlock and peruse,[11] raising the possibility of a renewed FBIÿApple encryption dispute.[24][25][26]\\r\\nThe attack occurred during the church's Sunday service.[27] Twenty-six people were killed and 20 others were injured. The dead comprise ten women, seven men, seven girls, one boy, and an unborn child.[11] Twenty-three died inside the church, two outside, and one in a hospital.[28] The oldest victim was 77 years old.[11] One victim was the 14-year-old daughter of church pastor Frank Pomeroy, who was elsewhere the day of the attack.[29][27][20][30] Visiting pastor Bryan Holcombe died with eight family members, including an unborn grandchild.[31]\\r\\nThe injured victims were taken to Connally Memorial Medical Center in Floresville, University Hospital in San Antonio, and Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston.[1]\\r\\nDevin Patrick Kelley (February 21, 1991[32] ÿ November 5, 2017) was raised in New Braunfels, Texas, about 35 miles (56?km) from Sutherland Springs, and attended New Braunfels High School.[27][33][34]\\r\\nAt New Braunfels High, Kelley had a lengthy disciplinary record, which included seven suspensions for \\"falsifying records, insubordination, profanity and a drug-related offense.\\"[35] One former high school classmate described him as \\"an outcast but not a loner\\" who was \\"popular among other outcasts.\\"[36] However, a martial arts instructor who taught Kelley during that time said Kelley signed up for his class because he was being bullied and that he did not fit in. Kelley graduated in 2009 with a 2.32 grade-point average and a ranking of 260 out of 393 students in his class.[35] A close friend from middle school through high school recalled \\"he wasn't always a 'psychopath' though\\" and that \\"over the years we all saw him change into something that he wasn't\\".[36]\\r\\nAfter graduating, Kelley enlisted in the United States Air Force. He served in logistics readiness at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2009 until 2014. He married in April 2011.[37][38] In October 2012, he was charged with assaulting his wife and fracturing his toddler stepson's skull. In response, Kelley made death threats against the superior officers who charged him, and he was caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base.[39] Around that same time, he made threats of self-harm to a coworker.[35] He was then admitted to Peak Behavioral Health Services, a mental health facility in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.[39]\\r\\nIn June 2012, Kelley escaped from Peak Behavioral Health Services but was soon apprehended ten miles away at a bus terminal in El Paso, Texas.[39][40] The facility's director of military affairs later recalled that Kelley had stayed at the facility for several weeks, until he was brought to court-martial. While there, he had expressed a desire for \\"some kind of retribution to his chain of command\\" and was discovered to have used computers to order \\"weapons and tactical gear to a P.O. box in San Antonio.\\"[40]\\r\\nKelley and his wife divorced in October 2012.[37] In an interview with Inside Edition, his ex-wife said she lived in constant fear of him, as their marriage was filled with abuse. He once threatened her at gunpoint over a speeding ticket, and later threatened to kill her and her entire family.[41]\\r\\nKelley was brought before a general court-martial on four charges: assault on his wife, aggravated assault on his stepson, two charges of pointing a loaded gun at his wife, and two counts of threatening his wife with an unloaded gun. In November 2012, Kelley pleaded guilty to two counts of Article 128 UCMJ, for the assault of his wife and stepson. In return, the weapons charges were dropped.[42][43][44] He was sentenced to 12 months of confinement and a reduction in rank to Airman Basic. He appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, but was unsuccessful.[45] In 2014, he was dismissed from the Air Force with a bad conduct discharge.[46][47]\\r\\nAfter his release, Kelley returned to New Braunfels, where he lived in a converted barn at his parents' home. Shortly thereafter, he was investigated for sexual assault and rape, and for a physical assault of his then-girlfriend.[43] A 2013 statement from the woman who accused Kelley of sexual assault, detailed an alleged attack on her. A separate statement from Kelley's first wife (who divorced him in October 2012) said that Kelley had physically abused her during the marriage; the woman wrote, \\"For a whole year, he slapped me, choked me, kicked me, water-boarded me and held a gun to my head.\\"[48][49] However, the Comal County, Texas Sheriff's Office did not bring charges against Kelley, and \\"the case became inactive because the victim did not respond to four follow-up calls and messages from a sheriff's office detective.\\"[49]\\r\\nOn April 4, 2014, Kelley married his then-girlfriend.[50] The couple moved into a mobile home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he was charged in August 2014 for misdemeanor cruelty to animals after beating his malnourished husky.[51] He was given a deferred sentence of probation and was ordered to pay restitution and other fees; the charge was dismissed in March 2016, after he completed the sentence.[43][51] In January 2015, a resident of El Paso County, Colorado received a protection order against him.[50]\\r\\nKelley attended the First Baptist Church in Kingsville, Texas, from May to June 2014 and volunteered as a helper for one day of Vacation Bible School.[52] Later on, he stopped volunteering at the summer Bible class and began posting about atheism online.[53] According to some of his former high school classmates, he was constantly \\"trying to preach his atheism\\" and describing people who believe in God as \\"stupid\\", causing them to delete him as a friend on Facebook for his posts.[54][53][55]\\r\\nAt the time of the shooting, Kelley was again living at his parents' property in New Braunfels.[43] He reportedly lied about his background to pass a background check and obtain a license from the Texas Department of Public Safety as a security guard,[56][57] and was a security worker at the Summit Vacation and RV Resort in New Braunfels.[33] He had previously worked as an unarmed security guard at the Schlitterbahn Waterpark and Resort in New Braunfels, but was fired after less than six weeks on the job.[33] While he was working at Schlitterbahn, a family who encountered him commented on how \\"creepy\\" Kelley had seemed; one member described, \\"He seemed angry. He seemed annoyed by us, and he seemed like he wanted to exert some authority.\\"[58]\\r\\nOn the night of October 31, less than a week before the shooting, Kelley attended a festival at the First Baptist Church wearing all black. According to two parishioners who were at the festival, he acted so strangely that people had to keep an eye on him. One also examined him to make sure he was not carrying a firearm.[41] According to a former Air Force colleague who temporarily got reacquainted with him online, Kelley claimed he would buy dogs and other animals and use them for \\"target practice\\". He also expressed his obsession with mass murders, particularly the Charleston church shooting, and joked about committing one himself. These comments prompted her to block him on Facebook.[35][59]\\r\\nKelley's estranged second wife sometimes attended First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs with her family.[43] Prior to the shooting, he sent threatening text messages to her mother.[15] His wife and her mother were not at the church when the attack occurred, but he killed his wife's grandmother at the church.[15][60]\\r\\nKelley purchased four guns at stores in Colorado and Texas between 2014 and 2017.[61] On October 29, a week before the shooting, he posted a photo of what appeared to be a Ruger model AR-556 rifle on his Facebook profile. A Ruger AR-556 rifle was used in the attack, and two handguns were found in Kelley's vehicle.[62]\\r\\nKelley purchased the semi-automatic rifle used in the shooting from an Academy Sports + Outdoors store in San Antonio in April 2016.[63] He filled out the required ATF Form 4473 and falsely indicated that he did not have a disqualifying criminal history. In Texas, an FBI National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) check is required at the time of purchase for all firearms except for purchasers with a valid license to carry a handgun.[64][65]\\r\\nThe State of Texas denied his application for a license to carry a handgun,[53][63] although a license is not required to purchase firearms under Texas state law.[61]\\r\\nKelley's general court-martial guilty plea made it illegal for him to own, buy, or possess a firearm or ammunition. The conviction should have been flagged by NICS and prevented the purchase.[63][66] Federal law prohibits those convicted of domestic violenceÿeven if it is only a misdemeanorÿfrom possessing firearms.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Air Force failed to relay the court-martial convictions to the FBI, saying in a statement, \\"Initial information indicates that Kelley's domestic violence offense was not entered into the National Crime Information Center database by the Holloman Air Force Base Office of Special Investigations.\\"[5][69] One day after the shooting, the Air Force said it had \\"launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction.\\"[5][68] Three days after the shooting, Vice President Mike Pence visited the crime scene, and said, \\"We will find why this information was not properly recorded in 2012, and we will work with leaders in Congress to ensure that this never happens again.\\"[70]\\r\\nIn 2018, the family of a couple that was murdered in the shooting sued the Air Force and Defense Department, alleging the government was negligent.[71]\\r\\nThe shooting brought attention to gaps in reporting to the federal background-check system intended to ban convicted domestic abusers, such as Kelley, from purchasing guns. Since 1996, the Lautenberg Amendment has prohibited the sale of firearms to those convicted of domestic abuse offenses, even misdemeanors, but gaps in reporting continue to exist.[68]\\r\\nPresident Donald Trump, in Japan at the time of the shooting, said at a press conference in Tokyo that \\"I think that mental health is a problem here. Based on preliminary reports, this was a very deranged individual with a lot of problems over a very long period of time. We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, as do other countries, but this isn't a guns situation ... we could go into it but it's a little bit soon to go into it. Fortunately somebody else had a gun that was shooting in the opposite direction, otherwise it wouldnt have been as bad as it was, it would have been much worse\\".[72] Trump was asked about gun policy while visiting Seoul, South Korea. In response to a proposal for extreme vetting of gun ownership similar to Trump's own call for \\"extreme vetting\\" of immigrants, Trump said that this would have made \\"no difference\\". He said that stricter gun control measures might have prevented Stephen Willeford from shooting Kelley, and commented, \\"Instead of having 26 dead, he would've had hundreds more dead.\\"[73][74] After the shooting, Trump issued a presidential proclamation honoring the victims[75] and ordered the United States flag at half-staff at the White House and all public and military sites until the sunset of November 9.[76] Willeford was called a hero for what he did.[77]\\r\\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott said that the shooting \\"will be a long, suffering mourning for those in pain.\\" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton proposed that churches employ professional armed security guards, or at least arm more parishioners, to counter church shootings, which he said have happened \\"forever\\" and will again.[78] Paxton was criticized by Manny Garcia, the Texas Democratic Party's deputy executive director, who said that \\"Texans deserve more from their chief law enforcement official than inaction and willful ignorance.\\"[79]\\r\\nOn November 9, the pastor of the church, Frank Pomeroy, announced that the building would be demolished and be replaced with a prayer garden, stating that it would be too painful to the victims to keep the building as is.[80][81] Later in the month he told the New York Times that reports of the church being demolished were inaccurate, and that a decision on the future of the church had not yet been made.[82]\\r\\nFake news websites and far-right activists published misleading stories and conspiracy stories about the incident.[83][84][85][86] They associated the shooter with a range of people and groups the far-right opposes[84] such as identifying him as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton supporter, Bernie Sanders supporter, Alt-left supporter, or radical Muslim;[87][85] or claiming that he carried an Antifa flag and told churchgoers, \\"This is a communist revolution.\\"[88][89][90] Some reports falsely claimed that he targeted the church because they were \\"white conservatives\\".[84] U.S. Representative Vicente Gonzlez twice incorrectly named the shooter as \\"Sam Hyde\\", a comedian who is often jokingly referred to as the perpetrator on social media. Gonzlez said that he had been given that name by officials.[91]\\r\\nConspiracy theories circulated at the hospital where victims were being treated. According to The Washington Post, a group of women who said they knew the victims were overheard discussing the shooting as a false flag operation designed to manipulate the public towards some nefarious end. The Post reporter sought to inquire further, but the women pushed her away, saying, \\"She [the reporter] is part of it [the conspiracy],\\" after which the reporter was removed from the hospital by police.[83] The misinformation mirrored similar events in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting a few weeks earlier, in which perpetrator Stephen Paddock was falsely linked to leftist and Islamist groups.[84]\\r\\nIn 2018, two conspiracy theorists, Jodi Mann and Robert Ussery, were arrested after accosting the church's pastor, whose daughter was killed in the shooting. Both were charged with trespassing and resisting arrest, and Ussery was also charged with making a terroristic threat and possession of marijuana. Mann and Ussery deny that the massacre occurred and instead promote \\"false flag\\" conspiracy notions on the Internet, asserting that the Sutherland Springs attack and other attacks were orchestrated for political purposes.[92]","input":"When did the shooting in texas church happen?"},{"output":"four-yearly elected presidential, unicameral representative democracy","context":"The politics of Ecuador are multi-party. The central government polity is a four-yearly elected presidential, unicameral representative democracy. The President of Ecuador is head of state and head of government on a multi-party system, leading a cabinet with further executive power. Legislative power is not limited to the National Assembly as it may to a lesser degree be exercised by the executive which consists of the President convening an appointed executive cabinet. Subsequent acts of the National Assembly are supreme over Executive Orders where sufficient votes have been cast by the legislators. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.There is also constitutional republic\\r\\nThe constitution of Ecuador provides for a four-year term of office for the President, Vice President, and members of the National Assembly with concurrent elections.

Citizens must be at least 16 years of age to vote: suffrage is universal and compulsory for literate persons aged 18 to 65 and optional for 16 and 17 years of age and other eligible voters.\\r\\nThe?Economist Intelligence Unit?has rated Ecuador as \\"hybrid regime\\" in 2016.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEcuador's political parties have historically been small, loose organizations that depended more on populist, often charismatic, leaders to retain support than on programs or ideology.[2] Frequent internal splits have produced extreme factionalism. However, a pattern has emerged in which administrations from the center-left alternate with those from the center-right. Although Ecuador's political elite is highly factionalized along regional, ideological, and personal lines, a strong desire for consensus on major issues often leads to compromise. Opposition forces in Congress are loosely organized, but historically they often unite to block the administration's initiatives and to remove cabinet ministers.\\r\\nConstitutional changes enacted by a specially elected National Constitutional Assembly in 1998 took effect on August 10, 1998. The new constitution strengthens the executive branch by eliminating mid-term congressional elections and by circumscribing Congress' power to challenge cabinet ministers. Party discipline is traditionally weak, and routinely many deputies switch allegiance during each Congress. However, after the new Constitution took effect, the Congress passed a Code of Ethics which imposes penalties on members who defy their party leadership on key votes.\\r\\nBeginning with the 1996 election, the more indigenous, less Spanish-rooted, ethnic groups abandoned their traditional policy of shunning the official political system and participated actively. The indigenous population has established itself as a significant force in Ecuadorian politics, as shown by the selection of indigenous representative Nina Pacari, who led the indigenous political party, Pachakutik, as second vice president of the 1998 Congress.\\r\\nA presidential election was held on October 15 and November 26, 2006. Rafael Correa defeated Alvaro Noboa in a run-off election, or second and final round. Correa won with 56.8% of the vote.[3] There was an attempted coup against President Rafael Correa in 2010. Correa became the first president in decades to win re-election and complete multiple full terms. He enjoyed a long period of sustained high approval ratings and stability before plummeting oil prices, proposed tax increases, and accusations of increasingly authoritarian behavior sparked protests and eroded his popularity in the final two years of his presidency.[4]\\r\\nNew justices of the Supreme Court are elected by the sitting members of the court. A bare majority of Congress, acting in a special session called by former President Lucio Gutirrez in December 2004, ousted 27 of the 31 justices and replaced them with new members chosen by Congress, notwithstanding the lack of any provisions permitting impeachment of Supreme Court justices by Congress and the specific provisions giving the Court the power to select new members. Earlier, in November 2004, Congress replaced the majority of judges on the country's Electoral Court and Constitutional Court by a similar process.\\r\\nAfter the adoption of a new Constitution in 2008, the judicial branch of the country was completely renewed. Now it has a cooperative leadership having a judicial and an administrative head. First you have the National Court of Justice, which seats 21 judges elected for a period of 9 years. They are elected by the Judiciary Council based on a merits contest held by that office. They are the final stage of any judicial process serving as a Court of Cassation and create binding precedent based on Triple Reiterative Rulings from the Chambers of the Court. The President of the Court is elected amongst the members of the Court for a Period of 3 years where he will represent the Judicial Branch before the State. The current president of the National Court of Justice is Dr. Carlos Ruiz.\\r\\nSecond, you have the administrative branch of the Judicial Power, which consists of The Judiciary Council. The Council is formed by 9 Vocals who are elected by the Branch of Transparency and Social Control, which is formed by the Control Authorities of the State. The Vocals are elected also by a merits contest and it shall be formed by six experts in law and 3 experts in management, economics and other related areas. However, after the National Referendum that took place on May 5, 2011, the proposition impulsed by the government of Mr. Correa won and now the Judiciary Council change its formation making a constitutional amendment. Currently a Tri-Party Commission is serving as a Transitional Council with delegates from the Legislative, Executive and Transparency Branch, to reform the broken judicial system of the Country.\\r\\nFinally it is wise to say that there exist a Constitutional Court. However it does not exercise legal revision, but rather constitutional control of situations where constitutional rights are violated. Also they are the sole body in the State to interpret what the Constitution says.\\r\\nThe president and vice president are elected on the same ticket by popular vote for four-year term; Lucio Gutirrez was dramatically removed by an act of Congress on 20 April 2005; election last held 20 October 2002; runoff election held 24 November 2002 (next to be held 2006)\\r\\nThe executive branch includes 28 ministries.

He had a previous wife, who had died in 1929.[1]\\r\\nCantrell supported her with a pension of US$25 every two or three months, and she inherited his home in 1937. She received no further pension benefits after his death.

The law was later changed in 1939 to state that widows born after 1870 were not eligible for pensions. Hopkins generally kept her first marriage a secret, fearing that the resulting gossip (of marrying a much older man) would damage her reputation.[2]\\r\\nAfter researching records from Arkansas and United States Census Bureau data, Hopkins was certified by various historical organizations, most notably the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A spokeswoman for the UDC, Martha Boltz, has said that there may be two other widows, one in Tennessee and another in North Carolina, but if they are still alive, they choose to remain in anonymity.[1]\\r\\nMaudie Hopkins died on August 17, 2008, in a nursing home in Lexa, Arkansas, aged 93.[3]","input":"When did the last civil war veteran widow die?"},{"output":"Human occupants of the site","context":"The Cave of Altamira (Spanish: Cueva de Altamira; pronounced?[?ku?e.a ee al.ta.?mi.?a]) located near the historic town Santillana del Mar in Cantabria, Spain, is renowned for its numerous parietal cave paintings featuring charcoal drawings and polychrome paintings of contemporary local fauna and human hands, created during the Upper Paleolithic. The earliest paintings in the cave were executed around 15,500 years ago.[1]\\r\\nAltamira was the first European cave for which prehistoric origin of the paintings was suggested and promoted by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. He published his research with the support of Juan Vilanova y Piera in 1880 to public acclaim. Nonetheless a bitter public controversy among experts ensued and continued until 1902, as reports of similar findings of prehistoric paintings in the region had accumulated and evidence could no longer be rejected.[2]\\r\\nAltamira is located in the Franco-Cantabrian region and declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as the central element of the Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cave is approximately 1000 meters long[4] and consists of a series of twisting passages and chambers. The main passage varies from two to six meters in height. The cave was formed through collapses following early Karst phenomena in the calcareous rock of Mount Vispieres.\\r\\nArchaeological excavations in the cave floor found rich deposits of artifacts from the Upper Solutrean (c.?18,500 years ago) and Lower Magdalenian (between c.?16,590 and 14,000 years ago). Both periods belong to the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. In the millennia between these two occupations, the cave was evidently inhabited only by wild animals. Human occupants of the site were well-positioned to take advantage of the rich wildlife that grazed in the valleys of the surrounding mountains as well as the marine life available in nearby coastal areas. Around 13,000 years ago a rockfall sealed the cave's entrance, preserving its contents until its eventual discovery, which occurred after a nearby tree fell and disturbed the fallen rocks.\\r\\nHuman occupation was limited to the cave mouth, although paintings were created throughout the length of the cave. The artists used charcoal and ochre or haematite to create the images, often diluting these pigments to produce variations in intensity and creating an impression of chiaroscuro. They also exploited the natural contours of the cave walls to give their subjects a three-dimensional effect. The Polychrome Ceiling is the most impressive feature of the cave, depicting a herd of extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus[5]) in different poses, two horses, a large doe, and possibly a wild boar.\\r\\nDated to the Magdalenian occupation, these paintings include abstract shapes in addition to animal subjects. Solutrean paintings include images of horses and goats, as well as handprints that were created when artists placed their hands on the cave wall and blew pigment over them to leave a negative image. Numerous other caves in northern Spain contain Paleolithic art, but none is as complex or well-populated as Altamira.\\r\\nIn 1879, amateur archaeologist Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola was led by his eight-year-old daughter Mara to discover the cave's drawings.[6] The cave was excavated by Sautuola and archaeologist Juan Vilanova y Piera from the University of Madrid, resulting in a much acclaimed publication in 1880 which interpreted the paintings as Paleolithic in origin. The French specialists, led by Gabriel de Mortillet and Emile Cartailhac, were particularly adamant in rejecting the hypothesis of Sautuola and Piera, and their findings were loudly ridiculed at the 1889 Prehistorical Congress in Lisbon. Due to the supreme artistic quality, and the exceptional state of conservation of the paintings, Sautuola was even accused of forgery, as he was unable to answer why there were no soot (smoke) marks on the walls and ceilings of the cave. A fellow countryman maintained that the paintings had been produced by a contemporary artist, on Sautuola's orders. Later Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola found out the artist could have used marrow fat as oil for the lamp, producing much less soot than any other combustibles. Alcohol was not available at the time as far as we know. Still, it remains unexplained how the paintings in Altamira cave remained unaltered being wet.\\r\\nIt was not until 1902, when several other findings of prehistoric paintings had served to render the hypothesis of the extreme antiquity of the Altamira paintings less offensive, that the scientific society retracted their opposition to the Spaniards. That year, Emile Cartailhac emphatically admitted his mistake in the famous article, \\"Mea culpa d'un sceptique\\", published in the journal L'Anthropologie. Sautuola, having died 14 years earlier, did not live to witness his rehabilitation.\\r\\nFurther excavation work on the cave was done by Hermilio Alcalde del Ro between 1902ÿ04, the German Hugo Obermaier between 1924ÿ25 and finally by Joaqun Gonzlez Echegaray in 1968.\\r\\nThere is no scientific agreement on the dating of the archeological artifacts found in the cave, nor the drawings and paintings, and scientists continue to evaluate the age of the cave art at Altamira.\\r\\nIn 2008, researchers using uranium-thorium dating found that the paintings were completed over a period of up to 20,000 years rather than during a comparatively brief period.[7]\\r\\nA later study published in 2012 based on data obtained from further uranium-thorium dating research, dated some paintings in several caves in North Spain, including some of the claviform signs in the \\"Gran sala\\" of Altamira, and concluded that the first works in Altamira belonged to the Aurignacian culture, 35,600 years old, right at the beginning of human occupation of North Spain by modern humans.[8] This means that these drawings could have been made by Neanderthal authors instead of homo sapiens, as assumed until now.[1]\\r\\nDuring the 1970s and 2000s, the paintings were being damaged by the carbon dioxide in the breath of the large number of visitors. Altamira was completely closed to the public in 1977, and reopened to limited access in 1982. Very few visitors were allowed in per day, resulting in a three-year waiting list. After green mold began to appear on some paintings in 2002, the caves were closed to public access.[9] A replica cave and museum were built nearby and completed in 2001 by Manuel Franquelo and Sven Nebel, reproducing the cave and its art. The replica allows a more comfortable view of the polychrome paintings of the main hall of the cave, as well as a selection of minor works. It also includes some sculptures of human faces that are not visitable in the real cave.[6]\\r\\nAs well as the adjacent National Museum and Research Center of Altamira there are reproductions in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain (Madrid), in the Deutsches Museum in Munich (completed 1964) and in Japan (completed 1993).\\r\\nDuring 2010 there were plans to reopen access to the cave towards the end of that year.[10] In December 2010, however, the Spanish Ministry of Culture decided that the cave would remain closed to the public.[11] This decision was based on advice from a group of experts who had found that the conservation conditions inside the cave had become much more stable since the closure.\\r\\nSome of the polychrome paintings at Altamira Cave are well known in Spanish popular culture. The logo used by the autonomous government of Cantabria to promote tourism to the region is based on one of the bisons in this cave. Bisonte (Spanish for \\"bison\\"), a Spanish cigarette brand of the 20th century, also used a Paleolithic style bison figure along with its logo.\\r\\nThe Spanish comic series Altamiro de la Cueva, created in 1965, are a consequence of the fame of Altamira Cave. The comic series depicts the adventures of a group of prehistoric cavemen, shown as modern people, but dressed in pieces of fur, a bit like the Flintstones.\\r\\nThe song \\"The Caves of Altamira\\" appears on the 1976 album The Royal Scam by jazz-rock band Steely Dan, later covered by soul group Perri.\\r\\nThe mid-20th-century modern dinnerware line Primitive, designed by Viktor Schreckengost for the American pottery company Salem China, was based on the bison, deer, and stick figure hunters depicted in the Altamira cave paintings.\\r\\nThe song \\"Cuevas de Altamira\\" (Caves of Altamira) appears on the 1978 album Cuevas de Altamira by the symphonic progressive rock-folk group Ibio from Cantabria.\\r\\nThe iconic bison image has been used for the cover of the poetry collection Songs for the Devil and Death by Scottish author Hal Duncan.[12]\\r\\nThe protagonist in Satyajit Ray's film Agantuk was inspired by the charging Bison painting to leave his home and study tribals.\\r\\nIn 2016, British Director Hugh Hudson released the film Altamira (called Finding Altamira outside Spain) about the discovery of the caves, starring Antonio Banderas and with music by Mark Knopfler.","input":"Who created the cave paintings of altamira spain?"},{"output":"Republic of Texas","context":"French and German\\r\\nNative languages (Caddo, Comanche) and Portuguese regionally\\r\\nThe Republic of Texas (Spanish: Rep~blica de Tejas) was an independent sovereign country in North America that existed from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846. It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming to the north. The citizens of the republic were known as Texians.\\r\\nThe Mexican province of Tejas (in English history books usually referred to as Mexican Texas) declared its independence from Mexico during the Texas Revolution in 1836. The Texas war of independence ended on April 21, 1836, but Mexico refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas, and intermittent conflicts between the two states continued into the 1840s. The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory.[2]\\r\\nThe Republic-claimed borders were based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly created Texas Republic and Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna of Mexico. The eastern boundary had been defined by the AdamsÿOns Treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain, which recognised the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. Under the AdamsÿOns Treaty of 1819 the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande which it claimed to have acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.\\r\\nThe republic's southern and western boundary with Mexico continued to be disputed throughout the republic's existence. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary, while Mexico insisted that the Nueces River was the boundary. Texas was annexed by the United States on December 29, 1845 and was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on that day, with the transfer of power from the Republic to the new state of Texas formally taking place on February 19, 1846. However, the United States again inherited the southern and western border dispute with Mexico, which became a trigger for the MexicanÿAmerican War of 1846ÿ48.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTexas had been one of the Provincias Internas of New Spain, a region known historiographically as Spanish Texas. Though claimed by Spain, it was not formally colonized by them until competing French interests at Fort St. Louis encouraged Spain to establish permanent settlements in the area.[3] Sporadic missionary incursions occurred into the area during the period from the 1690sÿ1710s, before the establishment of San Antonio as a permanent civilian settlement.[4] Owing to the area's high Native American populations and its remoteness from the population centers of New Spain, Texas remained largely unsettled by Europeans, although Spain maintained a small military presence to protect Christian missionaries working among Native American tribes, and to act as a buffer against the French in Louisiana and British North America. In 1762, France ceded to Spain most of its claims to the interior of North America, including its claim to Texas, as well as the vast interior that became Spanish Louisiana.[5] During the years 1799 to 1803, the height of the Napoleonic Empire, Spain returned Louisiana back to France, which promptly sold the territory to the United States. The status of Texas during these transfers was unclear and was not resolved until 1819, when the AdamsÿOns Treaty ceded Spanish Florida to the United States, and established a clear boundary between Texas and Louisiana.[6]\\r\\nStarting in 1810, the territories of New Spain north of the Isthmus of Panama (including Texas) sought independence in the Mexican War of Independence. Many Americans fought on the side of Mexico against Spain in filibustering expeditions. One of these, the GutirrezÿMagee Expedition (also known as the Republican Army of the North) consisted of a group of about 130 Americans under the leadership of Bernardo Gutirrez de Lara. Gutierrez de Lara initiated Mexico's secession from Spain with efforts contributed by Magee. Bolstered by new recruits, and led Samuel Kemper (who succeeded Magee after his death in battle in 1813), the expedition gained a series of victories against soldiers led by the Spanish governor, Manuel Mara de Salcedo. Their victory at the Battle of Rosillo Creek convinced Salcedo to surrender on April 1, 1813; he was executed two days later. On April 6, 1813, the victorious Republican Army of the North drafted a constitution and declared the independent Republic of Texas, with Gutirrez as its president.[7] Soon disillusioned with the Mexican leadership, the Americans under Kemper returned to the United States. The ephemeral Republic of Texas came to an end following the August 18, 1813 Battle of Medina, where the Spanish Army crushed the Republican Army of the North. The harsh reprisals against the Texas rebels created a deep distrust of the Royal Spanish authorities, and veterans of the Battle of Medina would later become leaders of the Texas Revolution and signatories of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico some 20 years later.\\r\\nAlong with the rest of Mexico, Texas gained its independence from Spain following the Treaty of C܇rdoba, and the new Mexican state was organized under the Plan of Iguala which created Mexico as a constitutional monarchy under its first Emperor Agustn de Iturbide. During the transition from a Spanish territory to part of the independent country of Mexico, Stephen F. Austin led a group of American settlers known as the Old Three Hundred, who negotiated the right to settle in Texas with the Spanish Royal governor of the territory. Since Mexican independence had been ratified by Spain shortly thereafter, Austin would later travel to Mexico City to secure the support of the new country in his right to settle.[8] The establishment of Mexican Texas coincided with the Austin-led settlement, leading to animosity between Mexican authorities and ongoing American settlement of Texas. The First Mexican Empire was short lived, being replaced by a republican form of government in 1823. Following Austin's lead, additional groups of settlers, known as Empresarios, continued to colonize Mexican Texas from the United States. In 1830, Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante outlawed American immigration to Texas, following several conflicts with the Empresarios over the status of slavery in the region.[9] Angered at the interference of the Mexican government, the Empresarios held the Convention of 1832, which is considered the first formal step in what would later become the Texas Revolution.\\r\\nOn the eve of war, the American settlers in the area outnumbered Mexicans by a considerable margin.[10] Following a series of minor skirmishes between Mexican authorities and the settlers, the Mexican government, fearing open rebellion of their Anglo subjects, began to step up military presence in Texas throughout 1834 and early 1835. Mexican President Antonio L܇pez de Santa Anna revoked the 1824 Constitution of Mexico and began to consolidate power in the central government under his own leadership. The Texian leadership under Austin began to organize its own military, and hostilities broke out on October 2, 1835 at the Battle of Gonzales, the first engagement of the Texas Revolution.[11] In November, 1835 a provisional government known as the Consultation was established to oppose the Santa Anna regime (but stopped short of declaring independence from Mexico). On March 1, 1836 the Convention of 1836 came to order, and the next day declared independence from Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas.[12]\\r\\nThe second Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, known as the Father of Texas, died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as Secretary of State for the new Republic.\\r\\nIn 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia), before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. The next president, Mirabeau B. Lamar, moved the capital to the new town of Austin in 1839.\\r\\nThe first flag of the republic was the \\"Burnet Flag\\" (a single gold star on an azure field), followed in 1839 by official adoption of the Lone Star Flag.\\r\\nInternal politics of the Republic centred on two factions. The nationalist faction, led by Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans (Indians), and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with the Indians, when possible. The Texas Congress even passed a resolution over Houston's veto claiming the Californias for Texas.[13] The 1844 presidential election split the electorate dramatically, with the newer western regions of the Republic preferring the nationalist candidate Edward Burleson, while the cotton country, particularly east of the Trinity River, went for Anson Jones.[14]\\r\\nThe Comanche Indians furnished the main Indian opposition to the Texas Republic, manifested in multiple raids on settlements, capture and rape of female pioneers, torture killings, and trafficking in captive slaves.[15] In the late 1830s, Sam Houston negotiated a peace between Texas and the Comanches. Lamar replaced Houston as president in 1838 and reversed the Indian policies. He returned to war with the Comanches and invaded Comancheria itself. In retaliation, the Comanches attacked Texas in a series of raids. After peace talks in 1840 ended with the massacre of 34 Comanche leaders in San Antonio, the Comanches launched a major attack deep into Texas, known as the Great Raid of 1840. Under command of Potsanaquahip (Buffalo Hump), 500 to 700 Comanche cavalry warriors swept down the Guadalupe River valley, killing and plundering all the way to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where they sacked the towns of Victoria and Linnville. Houston became president again in 1841 and, with both Texians and Comanches exhausted by war, a new peace was established.[16]\\r\\nAlthough Texas achieved self-government, Mexico refused to recognize its independence.[17] On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by Rfael Vsquez, invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. About 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general Adrin Woll, launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the Battle of Salado Creek while simultaneously, a mile and a half away, Mexican soldiers massacred a militia of fifty-three Texas volunteers who had surrendered after a skirmish.[18][19] That night, the Mexican Army retreated from the city of San Antonio back to Mexico.\\r\\nMexico's attacks on Texas intensified conflicts between political factions, including an incident known as the Texas Archive War. To \\"protect\\" the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them removed from Austin. The archives were eventually returned to Austin, albeit at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and this episode in Texas history would solidify Austin as Texas's seat of government for the Republic and the future state.[20]\\r\\nThere were also domestic disturbances. The RegulatorÿModerator War involved a land feud in Harrison and Shelby Counties in East Texas from 1839 to 1844. The feud eventually involved Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and other East Texas counties. Harrison County Sheriff John J. Kennedy and county judge Joseph U. Fields helped end the conflict, siding with the law-and-order party. Sam Houston ordered 500 militia to help end the feud.\\r\\nAfter gaining their independence, the Texas voters had elected a Congress of 14 senators and 29 representatives in September 1836. The Constitution allowed the first president to serve for two years and subsequent presidents for 3 years. In order to hold an office or vote, a person needed to be a citizen of the Republic.[21]\\r\\nHowever, it is important to note that citizenship was not granted to all previous inhabitants of Texas, and not all of them could even live legally within the limits of the Republic without the consent of Congress. In this regard, the Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836) established major differences according to the ethnicity of each individual. Section 10 of the General Provisions of the constitution stated that all persons who were residing in Texas on the day of the Declaration of Independence were to be considered citizens of the Republic, excepting \\"Africans, the descendants of Africans, and Indians\\".[22] For new white immigrants, section 6 established that, in order to become citizens, they needed to live in the Republic for at least six months and take an oath. While regarding the black population, section 9 established that black persons who were brought to Texas as slaves were to remain slaves, and that not even their owner could emancipate them without the consent of Congress, while the Congress itself was not allowed to make laws affecting the slave trade or to declare emancipation. Section 9 also established that: \\"No free person of African descent, either in whole or in part, shall be permitted to reside permanently in the Republic, without the consent of Congress\\".[23]\\r\\nThe first Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, often referred to as the \\"Father of Texas,\\" died on December 27, 1836, after serving just two months as the republic's secretary of state. Due mainly to the ongoing war for independence, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas in 1836: (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia). The capital was moved to the new city of Houston in 1837.\\r\\nIn 1839, a small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas was chosen as the republic's seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town was renamed Austin shortly thereafter in honor of Stephen F. Austin.\\r\\nThe court system inaugurated by Congress included a Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice appointed by the president and four associate justices, elected by a joint ballot of both houses of Congress for four-year terms and eligible for re-election. The associates also presided over four judicial districts. Houston nominated James Collinsworth to be the first chief justice. The county-court system consisted of a chief justice and two associates, chosen by a majority of the justices of the peace in the county. Each county was also to have a sheriff, a coroner, justices of the peace, and constables to serve two-year terms. Congress formed 23 counties, whose boundaries generally coincided with the existing municipalities.\\r\\nIn 1839, Texas became the first nation in the world to enact a homestead exemption under which a person's primary residence could not be seized by creditors.\\r\\nThe Texan leaders at first intended to extend their national boundaries to the Pacific Ocean, but ultimately decided to claim the Rio Grande as boundary, including much of New Mexico, which the Republic never controlled. They also hoped, after peace was made with Mexico, to run a railroad to the Gulf of California to give \\"access to the East Indian, Peruvian and Chilean trade.\\"[24] When negotiating for the possibility of annexation to the US in late 1836, the Texan government instructed its minister Wharton in Washington that if the boundary were an issue, Texas was willing to settle for a boundary at the watershed between the Nueces River and Rio Grande, and leave out New Mexico.[25] In 1840 the first and only census of the Republic of Texas was taken, recording a population of about 70,000 people. San Antonio and Houston were recorded as the largest and second largest cities respectively.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn March 3, 1837, US President Andrew Jackson appointed Alce La Branche American charg d'affaires to the Republic of Texas, thus officially recognizing Texas as an independent republic.[26] France granted official recognition of Texas on September 25, 1839, appointing Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to serve as charg d'affaires. The French Legation was built in 1841, and still stands in Austin as the oldest frame structure in the city.[27] Conversely, the Republic of Texas embassy in Paris was located in what is now the H?tel de Vend?me, adjacent to the Place Vend?me in Paris's 2e arrondissement.[28]\\r\\nThe Republic also received diplomatic recognition from Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Republic of Yucatn. The United Kingdom never granted official recognition of Texas due to its own friendly relations with Mexico, but admitted Texan goods into British ports on their own terms. In London, immediately opposite the gates to St. James's Palace, Sam Houston's original Embassy of the Republic of Texas to the Court of St. James's is now a hat shop, but is clearly marked with a large plaque and a nearby restaurant is called Texas Embassy.[29] A plaque on the exterior of 3 St. James's Street in London notes the upper floors of the building (which have housed the noted wine merchant Berry Brothers and Rudd since 1698) housed the Texas Legation.\\r\\nOn February 28, 1845, the US Congress passed a bill that would authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas. On March 1, US President John Tyler signed the bill. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. Faced with imminent American annexation of Texas, Charles Elliot and Alphonse de Saligny, the British and French ministers to Texas, were dispatched to Mexico City by their governments. Meeting with Mexico's foreign secretary, they signed a \\"Diplomatic Act\\" in which Mexico offered to recognize an independent Texas with boundaries that would be determined with French and British mediation. Texas President Anson Jones forwarded both offers to a specially elected convention meeting at Austin, and the American proposal was accepted with only one dissenting vote. The Mexican proposal was never put to a vote. Following the previous decree of President Jones, the proposal was then put to a vote throughout the republic.\\r\\nOn October 13, 1845, a large majority of voters in the republic approved both the American offer and the proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and emigrants bringing slaves to Texas.[30] This constitution was later accepted by the US Congress, making Texas a US state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845 (therefore bypassing a territorial phase).[31] One of the motivations for annexation was the huge debts which the Republic of Texas government had incurred. As part of the Compromise of 1850, in return for $10,000,000 in Federal bonds, Texas dropped claims to territory which included parts of present-day Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming.\\r\\nThe resolution did include two unique provisions: First, it said up to four additional states could be created from Texas' territory with the consent of the State of Texas (and that new states north of the Missouri Compromise Line would be free states). Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution,[32] the U.S. Constitution neither requires Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be ex post to applications nor to expire. To illustrate the strength of the latter caveat, the 27th Amendment was submitted to the states in 1789, yet was not ratified until 1992; thus, the expressed consent of Congress, via this resolution, to the creation of new states would not expire nor require renewal. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas owned by the federal government are those which were subsequently purchased by it. This also means the state government has control over oil reserves which were later used to fund the state's public university system through the Permanent University Fund.[33] In addition, the state's control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 nautical leagues (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668?km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56?km) as with other states.[34][35]","input":"What was texas called when it became independent?"},{"output":"31,492 at the 2010 census","context":"Parkersburg is a city in and the county seat of Wood County, West Virginia, United States.[5] Located at the confluence of the Ohio and Little Kanawha rivers, it is the state's third-largest city and the largest city in the Parkersburg-Marietta-Vienna metropolitan area.

This was part of a westward migration of settlers from parts of Virginia to the east, closer to the Atlantic Ocean. A town section was laid out on land granted to Alexander Parker for his Revolutionary War service. Virginia made grants of land to veterans for their war service. The title conflicts between Parker and the city planners of Newport were settled in 1809 in favor of his heirs. The town was renamed Parkersburg in 1810. It was chartered by the Virginia General Assembly in 1820. It was rechartered as a city in 1860.\\r\\nThe town was the western terminus of both the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike and the Northwestern Turnpike. In 1857 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad built a branch line south to the town from Wheeling, West Virginia. Travelers wanting to connect with the Ohio Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad, one of the eastÿwest lines along the Ohio River, had to take a steamboat 14 miles north to Marietta, Ohio.\\r\\nJacob Linville designed the railroad bridge planned by the B&O. It was constructed in 1868ÿ1870 between Parkersburg and Belpre, Ohio, as part of the B&O's main line from Baltimore to St. Louis, Missouri.[6] This drew traffic and trade from Marietta. Today the structure is known as the Parkersburg Bridge.\\r\\nParkersburg served as a transportation and medical center for Union forces during the American Civil War.

The Camden Consolidated Oil Company, founded in 1866 by future U.S. Senator Johnson Newlon Camden, dominated the refining business and was sold to Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in 1875. Camden became a Standard director and vice president and, along with John W.

The single, released on July 10, 1967, was a number-one hit in the US and a big international seller. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song of the year.[1] It generated eight Grammy nominations, resulting in three wins for Gentry and one for arranger Jimmie Haskell.[2] \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\" has since made Rolling Stone's lists of the \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\" and the \\"100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time\\" and Pitchfork's \\"200 Best Songs of the 1960s\\".[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song takes the form of a first-person narrative performed over sparse acoustic accompaniment. It tells of a rural Mississippi family's reaction to the news of the suicide of Billie Joe McAllister, a local boy to whom the daughter (and narrator) is connected. Hearsay around the \\"Tallahatchie Bridge\\" forms the narrative and musical hook. The song concludes with the demise of the father and the lingering, singular effects of the two deaths on the family. According to Gentry the song is about indifference and unshared grief.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nGentry's song takes the form of first-person narrative by the young daughter of a Mississippi Delta family. It offers fragments of the dinnertime conversation on the day that a local boy, and acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge, the account interspersed between everyday, polite conversation. The song's final verse conveys the passage of events over the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner.[6] After cautioning them about tracking in dirt, Mama says that she \\"got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge\\" that \\"Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\". At the dinner table, the father seems unmoved, commenting, \\"Billie Joe never had a lick o' sense\\", before asking for the biscuits and adding that there's \\"five more acres in the lower forty\\" left to plow. Her brother is intrigued (\\"I saw him at the sawmill yesterday ... And now you tell me Billie Joe has jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\"), but not enough to be distracted from the midday victuals. He recalls a prank that he, \\"Tom\\", and Billie Joe played on the narrator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only person affected is the narrator: her mother notices her change of mood following the news (\\"Child, what's happened to your appetite? I've been cookin' all mornin' and you haven't touched a single bite\\"). The mother shares the news that a local preacher visited earlier and, as an aside, adds that he mentioned seeing the someone looking much like the narrator and Billie Joe \\"throwin' somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\". In the song's final verse, a year has passed. The narrator's brother has married Becky Thompson and has moved to another town (\\"bought a store in Tupelo\\"). The father died from a viral infection and the mother is despondent (\\"Mama doesn't seem to want to do much of anything\\"). The narrator likewise remains privately affected: she often visits Choctaw Ridge collecting flowers to \\"drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestions arose among listeners: what did Billie Joe and his girlfriend throw off the Tallahatchie Bridge, and why did Billie Joe commit suicide? Speculation ran rampant after the song hit the airwaves. Gentry said in a November 1967 interview that it was the question most asked of her by everyone she met. She named flowers, an engagement ring, a draft card, a bottle of LSD pills, and an aborted baby as the most often guessed items. Although she knew what the item was, she would not reveal it, saying only \\"Suppose it was a wedding ring.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"It's in there for two reasons,\\" she said. \\"First, it locks up a definite relationship between Billie Joe and the girl telling the story, the girl at the table. Second, the fact that Billie Joe was seen throwing something off the bridge ÿ no matter what it was ÿ provides a possible motivation as to why he jumped off the bridge the next day.\\"[7]\\r\\nWhen Herman Raucher met Gentry in preparation for writing a novel and screenplay based on the song, she said that she had no idea why Billie Joe killed himself.[8] Gentry has, however, commented elsewhere on the song, saying that it is about indifference:[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThose questions are of secondary importance in my mind. The story of Billie Joe has two more interesting underlying themes. First, the illustration of a group of people's reactions to the life and death of Billie Joe, and its subsequent effect on their lives, is made. Second, the obvious gap between the girl and her mother is shown when both women experience a common loss (first Billie Joe, and later, Papa), and yet Mama and the girl are unable to recognize their mutual loss or share their grief.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge supposedly mentioned in this song collapsed in June 1972.[10]\\r\\nIt crossed the Tallahatchie River at Money, about ten miles (16?km) north of Greenwood, Mississippi, and has since been rebuilt. The November 10, 1967, issue of Life Magazine contained a photo of Gentry crossing the original bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Ode to Billie Joe\\" was originally intended as the B-side of Gentry's first single recording, a blues number called \\"Mississippi Delta\\", on Capitol Records. The original recording, with no other musicians backing Gentry's guitar, had eleven verses lasting seven minutes, telling more of Billie Joe's story. The executives realized that this song was a better option for a single, so they cut the length by almost half and re-recorded it with a string orchestra. The only surviving draft of the 7 minute version of \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\", which consists of two handwritten pages, is located in the archive of the University of Mississippi.[11] Gentry donated the draft to the Universitys Faulkner room in 1973.[12] In addition to the iconic lyrics that made the final cut, the unused lyrics may showcase Bobbie Gentry's  mindset and possible answer to mystery of what was throw from the bridge; as well as the relationship of the narrator to Billie Joe.  The shorter version left more of the story to the listener's imagination, and made the single more suitable for radio airplay.[13] In an interview with Bob Harris broadcast by BBC Radio 2 in Bob Harris Country on April 16, 2009, singer Rachel Harrington claimed that Gentry originally wrote eleven verses, but deleted six because a record producer thought the song was too long. The song is noted for its long descending scale by the strings at the conclusion, suggesting the flowers falling after being dropped off the Tallahatchie Bridge and ending up in the river water below.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe song's popularity proved so enduring that in 1976, nine years after its release, Warner Bros. commissioned author Herman Raucher to expand and adapt the story as a novel and screenplay, Ode to Billy Joe. The poster's tagline, which treats the film as being based on a true story and gives a date of death for Billy (June 3, 1953), led many to believe that the song was based on actual events.[8] In Raucher's novel and screenplay, Billy Joe kills himself after a drunken homosexual experience, and the object thrown from the bridge is the narrator's ragdoll. The film was released in 1976, directed and produced by Max Baer, Jr, and starring Robby Benson and Glynnis O'Connor. Only the first, second, and fifth verses were sung by Bobbie Gentry in the film, omitting the third and fourth verses.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the novel, the ragdoll is the central character's confidant and advisor.  Tossing it off the bridge symbolizes throwing away her childhood, becoming a self-contained adult.\\r\\n\\r\\nBilly Joe's story is analyzed in Professor John Howard's history of gay Mississippi entitled Men Like That: A Queer Southern History as an archetype of what Howard calls the \\"gay suicide myth\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after the song's chart success, the Tallahatchie Bridge was visited by more individuals who wanted to jump off it. Since the bridge height was only 20 feet (6?m), death or injury was unlikely. To curb the trend, the Leflore County Board enacted a law fining jumpers $100.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967 American/French singer-songwriter Joe Dassin had much success with a French translation of the song titled \\"Marie-Jeanne\\". It tells exactly the same story nearly word for word, but the lead characters are reversed. The narrator is one of the sons of the household, and the character who committed suicide is a girl named Marie-Jeanne Guillaume.\\r\\n\\r\\nA quick overview of the translated names and places:\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the change in character names and locations, the translator adapted mentions of food and crops to be associated with rural France. For instance, the narrator worked in a vineyard. The setting is a fictitious small town in southwest France. The River Garonne is real.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, a Swedish translation by Olle Adolphson titled \\"Jon Andreas visa\\" was recorded by Siw Malmkvist.[15] It is faithful to the story in \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\", but has changed the setting to rural Sweden.

It was written by Adele and Dan Wilson for her second studio album, 21. It is the second single and final track on the album.

XL Recordings released the song as the second single from the album on 24 January 2011 in the United Kingdom and on 9 August 2011 in the United States. Accompanied only by a piano in the song (played by co-writer Wilson), Adele sings about the end of the relationship with her ex-boyfriend.

She wrote it with American songwriter and producer Dan Wilson.[4] It was one of the last written for 21.[4] The track, which epitomizes the lyrical content of 21, summarizes the now defunct relationship that the record is all about.[5] Adele has openly discussed the genesis of it saying, \\"Well, I wrote that song because I was exhausted from being such a bitch, with 'Rolling in the Deep' or 'Rumour Has It' ... I was really emotionally drained from the way I was portraying him, because even though I'm very bitter and regret some parts of it, he's still the most important person that's ever been in my life, and 'Someone like You,' I had to write it to feel OK with myself and OK with the two years I spent with him. And when I did it, I felt so freed.\\"[6]\\r\\nAdele revealed that she was struggling emotionally when she composed it: \\"When I was writing it I was feeling pretty miserable and pretty lonely, which I guess kind of contradicts 'Rolling in the Deep'. Whereas that was about me saying, 'I'm going to be fine without you', this is me on my knees really.\\"[5] She discussed further the inspiration of the song: \\"I can imagine being about 40 and looking for him again, only to turn up and find that he's settled with a beautiful wife and beautiful kids and he's completely happy... and I'm still on my own. The song's about that and I'm scared at the thought of that.\\"[5]\\r\\nAdele had said that she began writing it on her acoustic guitar in the wake of the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. \\"We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for.\\"[7] She also said that \\"I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. I was waiting for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else.\\"[8]\\r\\nAdele later collaborated with famed musician and producer Dan Wilson to write \\"Someone like You\\" which was one of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar.[9] The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: \\"We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school.\\"[9] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible.[10] He added \\"We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, but she always knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan.\\"[10] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio.[4] The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.[4]\\r\\nÿ James Montgomery of MTV News talking about \\"Someone like You\\".[11]\\r\\nAccording to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony Music Publishing, \\"Someone like You\\" is a slow tempo of 68 beats per minute.[12] Written in common time, the song is in the key of A major.[12] Adele's vocal range spans from F?3 to E5 during the song.[12] A slow, plaintive ballad pairing Adele's voice with a looping piano line, \\"Someone like You\\" is the lyrical opposite of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\"[13] on which the singer narrates coming to terms with the end of the relationship:[13] \\"Nevermind, I'll find someone like you/I wish nothing but the best for you, too/Don't forget me, I beg/I'll remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.\\" According to Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice, the singer's \\"nuanced\\"[14] voice goes up a full octave and \\"into a near-shrieked whisper\\" as she sings parts of the chorus.[14] However, she \\"rebounds and gathers herself\\", and her voice descends into its fuller and more melancholy state.[14] Critics praised its introspective lyrics and maturity.[15][16] \\"Someone like You\\" has been compared to the song \\"Hometown Glory\\" (2008) from the album 19.[15] John Murphy of MusicOMH said that the song \\"casts Adele as the spurned lover, turning up outside her ex's house, now moved on and settled down, begging for a second chance.\\"[17] According to Aamir Yaqub of Soul Culture, \\"Talking of a lost love, this an extremely touching track with a vocal performance that makes the narrative almost tangible ... It really captures the experience of the story and puts it across in both a credible and incredible fashion.\\"[18] Cameron Adams of Herald Sun called the song a \\"spine-tingling sparse piano ballad.\\"[19]\\r\\nLyrically, the song talks about the end of Adele's first \\"real relationship\\" with her long-time friend and lover and it shows her confronting his marriage.[20][21] At the beginning of the song, she sings the lines \\"I heard that you're settled down/That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true/Guess she gave you things I couldn't give to you\\" with a softly voice and accompanied just by a simple piano melody.[10][22] The lyrics of \\"Someone like You\\" are talking about what once was and what could have been as stated by a writer of Daily Herald.[22] Finding the strength to bounce back from hardship and heartache, Adele sings the lines, \\"Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too/Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.\\"[23] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: \\"The song's subjectAdele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhereis familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead'' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra.\\"[24]\\r\\nUpon release, the song received acclaim from a wide variety of publications and has been viewed as a highlight of 21. In a track-by-track review for 21, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK noted the track's placement at the end of the album saying, \\"It maybe a clich, but Adele has saved the best until last with this heartfelt and enchanting piano ballad. ... It's sad but beautiful and displays Adele at her best ÿ marking the perfect end to what has been in our eyes, a faultless album.\\"[15] Will Dean of The Guardian claimed the song was the album's \\"highlight\\", characterizing it as \\"gorgeous\\".[25] That was somehow echoed by Slant Magazine's Matthew Cole who also called the song \\"gorgeous\\".[26] NME's Parkin Chris also marked the song as a highlight, describing it as \\"surprisingly weighty\\" and comparing it favorably to the work of American Country blues singer Karen Dalton.[27]\\r\\nTom Breihan of Pitchfork Media selected \\"Someone like You\\" as a song of the day, claiming it served as a reaffirmation of popular music: \\"Sometimes, pop music can still break your heart.\\"[16] Writing for BBC Online, Ian Wade noted that the \\"final track Someone Like You, just voice and piano, is an actual thing of beauty, placing the listener in one of those moments where you feel you're in the presence of a future standard.\\"[28] Bill Lamb of About.com wrote that \\"the piano melody is gorgeous and combined with Adele's heartfelt reading of her words, the effect is highly emotional. You can imagine it being both honked through by talent show contestants and transcended by veterans alike.\\"[29] Lamb went to write that the song is one of the \\"top songs of 2011\\" and that \\"romantic pain has rarely been so utterly beautiful.\\"[29] Jer Fairall of PopMatters called the song an \\"absolute magic\\" and praised Adele's performance by saying, \\"Though it is unquestionably her finest vocal showcase to date, it is less remarkable for its more powerful moments than for the small ones where her voice dips, with rueful melancholy on the line 'I heard that your dreams came true' or cracks on the 'I beg' in the chorus, like she's startled at the revelation of her own vulnerability.\\"[24] He further called her vocal performance of the song \\"stunning\\" and \\"finally worthy of her talents\\".[24]\\r\\nWriting for the website No Ripcord, Gary McGinley said that the song \\"has an aching beauty and the hallmarks of a modern standard.\\"[30] He further added that it \\"sounds poised to soundtrack atmospheric TV trailers over the coming months.\\"[30] A writer of URB magazine called \\"Someone like You\\" \\"a heart-wrencher made all the more real by reeling phrasing and bare-voiced pleading, 'I wish nothing but the best for you, too.'\\"[31] John Murphy of MusicOMH categorized \\"Someone like You\\" and \\"Turning Tables\\" as \\"the two best songs on the album.\\"[17] He concluded that the song was \\"desperately sad and utterly, utterly gorgeous.\\"[17] Bary Walters of Spin wrote that on \\"the piano-led finale, she vows, 'I'll find someone like you,' as if that's progress. It's a statement that's utterly WTF and yet true to the cyclical nature of psychological damage.\\"[32] Sputnikmusic's Joseph Viney called the song \\"an ode to stalking with a perverse attitude that lies underneath the fragile composition, looks set to become the soundtrack to a million messy break-ups.\\"[33] Allison Stewart of The Washington Post put the song on her list \\"Recommended tracks\\".[34]\\r\\nAt the 2011 Q Awards, \\"Someone like You\\" was nominated in the category for Best Track.[35] The song was also nominated in the category for Best Song at the 2011 Music of Black Origin Awards.[36] \\"Someone like You\\" won the first Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance, at the 54th Grammy Awards, which were held on 12 February 2012.[37][38] The Village Voice's Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked \\"Someone like You\\" at number nine to find the best music of 2011; Adele's previous single \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" topped the same critics' poll.\\r\\n\\"Someone like You\\" achieved international commercial success, topping the record charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as reaching the top ten in many other countries.

By June 2015, UK sales stood at 1,570,000 copies, making \\"Someone like You\\" the second best-selling single of the 2010s and the third-best-seller of the 21st century.[3] As of November 2015, the song has sold 1,584,000 copies in the UK.[48]\\r\\nIn Finland, \\"Someone like You\\" debuted at number 14 in October 2011 and rose to number one in its 12th week in early 2012the week when Adele had three simultaneous top-ten songs (\\"Rolling in the Deep\\" at number two and \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\" at number seven).[49][50] In France, despite not having been certified, \\"Someone like You\\" has sold 350,800 copies and became one of the best-selling singles in the country.[51] The song debuted at number 47 on the Australian Singles Chart.[52] \\"Someone like You\\" remained at the top position of the chart for seven consecutive weeks[52] and it was certified 4G Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[53] It has also peaked at number one in New Zealand for five weeks, ending an 11-week run at number one for \\"Party Rock Anthem\\".[54] The single sold 51,000 copies its first week in the US, debuting at number 65.[55] The single re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 97 on the week ending 30 July 2011.[56] Upon its radio release in the United States, and a surge in popularity following her performance at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, \\"Someone like You\\" climbed 18 positions to number one from number 19, and became her second consecutive number-one single on the Hot 100 and making Adele the first ever British female singer to spawn two consecutive number-one singles from the same album.[57][58] After the performance, \\"Someone like You\\" moved from number 11 to number one on the Digital Songs chart with 275,000 downloads sold (191% increase), according to Nielsen SoundScan.[41][57] On Radio Songs, the track moved from number 42 to number 19 with 46 million all-format audience impressions (59% increase), according to Nielsen BDS.[57] The song made Hot 100 history by achieving the biggest jump to number 1 in the chart's 53-year history that was not spurred by the release of a single.[59] \\"Someone like You\\" became the first strictly voice-and-piano ballad to top the Billboard Hot 100.[60] The song also became the first \\"unquestionably slow song\\" to top the Hot 100 chart since Rihanna's song, \\"Take a Bow\\" (2008).[61] It topped the chart for 1 week and then slipped from number 1 to number 2 being replaced by Maroon 5 and Christina Aguilera's \\"Moves Like Jagger\\".[62] A few days after the release of its video, on 6 October 2011, the song returned to number one and spent more 4 weeks at the top,[63] where it was later replaced by \\"We Found Love\\" by Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris. With \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" spending 7 weeks at number one on the Hot 100 and \\"Someone like You\\" spending 5 weeks, Adele is the first female solo artist to log 12 weeks at #1 in a calendar year with two strictly solo recordings. Beyonc, Monica and Mariah Carey also did it (in 2003, 1998 and 1995, respectively), if collaborations are included.[64] As of October 2015, it has sold 6,000,000 downloads in the United States alone.[65]\\r\\nThe music video for the song was filmed in Paris, France, by English director Jake Nava[66] who said:[66][67]\\r\\nThe location evokes style and romance. And shooting early in the morning allows you to focus on Adele in this lonely and emotional space.\\r\\nThe video begins with a shot of a road in Paris and Adele is seen walking on it alone. She continues to walk and starts singing the song with a sad look as the camera makes circles and shots more locations in Paris including the Eiffel Tower. During the second chorus, Adele stops singing and pauses on the Pont Alexandre III to look over the Seine. She continues walking through the deserted streets during the bridge before finally entering a building in which she sees her ex-lover.[68] After seeing her, he starts to walk away and several shots of Adele looking at him follow.\\r\\nThe video premiered on MTV and Vevo on 29 September 2011,[11][66][69] and as of December 2017, the video has received 1 billion views on YouTube.[70]\\r\\n\\"Someone like You\\" received glowing reviews from music critics. James Montgomery of MTV News called the video \\"a somber, black-and-white affair, featuring Adele wandering the early morning streets and pining for her long-lost love. It's a perfect match for the song's jaw-dropping emotional rangeraw and unfiltered and incredibly sad but also, in a lot of ways, beautiful and resolute.\\"[66] In another review of the video he praised its black-and-white shots saying that \\"director Jake Nava made the smart decision to shoot it in arty, smudgy black-and-white, which only adds to the clip's desolate, haunted feel.\\"[11] He added that \\"there are no special effects, no camera tricks or elaborate choreography, because those are quick fixes\\" and called Adele the \\"Queen of Pain.\\"[11] A writer of the website HitFix concluded that the video is \\"in keeping with the singer's subdued style\\" and added that its vibe fits with the \\"melancholy tune.\\"[71] Entertainment Weekly's Tanner Stransky called the video \\"quiet\\" and said that \\"it's just what you'd want to see for this break-up heart-wrencher.\\"[68] Krista Wick of Entertainment Tonight praised the video for being \\"more than enough to accompany Adele's soulful vocals.\\"[72]\\r\\nAmanda Dobbins of New York magazine concluded that \\"the secretly devastating video\\" for \\"Someone like You\\" will remind Adele's ex-lover what he has done by leaving her.[73] A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video.[74] Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an \\"uncomplicated, moving film\\" and wrote, \\"the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more.\\"[75] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was \\"simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement.\\"[76] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, \\"speak[s] for itself\\" about the sadness in the video.[77] Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, \\"the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. The look on her face during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out.\\"[78]\\r\\nA writer of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"this clip for the ballad 'Someone Like You' sticks to the singer's simple but emotionally direct approach with black-and-white footage that lingers on her subtly expressive face as she lip-synchs to the tune while walking along sad, grey city streets.\\"[79] Andrea Devaro of Long Island Press concluded, \\"its simplicity beautifully portrays the complexity of emotions invoked in the song.\\"[80] Leah Collins of Dose called Adele \\"'60s bombshell glam\\" and said that the video's \\"simplicity is its strength.\\"[81] She added: \\"There's something about streetlamps, cafes and the River Seine that lend an air of melancholic elegance to what would otherwise be just another walk of shame by a girl with two-day-old hair. Not everyone gets to indulge in moments as tragic but beautiful as a weepy solitary walk through Paris landmarks. But then, we don't all have voices as tragic and beautiful as Adele's either.\\"[81] A more mixed review was given by AOL's Ashley Percival who called the video predictable and added \\"It's all very pleasant, but after all this time, what's the point?\\".[82] Nicole Eggenberger of OK! wrote that Adele \\"created the perfect music video to go along with her hauntingly beautiful ballad\\" and further described it as \\"simple yet stunning.\\"[83]\\r\\nAdele performed \\"Someone like You\\" for the first time in November 2010 on the BBC music show. Later, with Jools Holland before the release of the album. As the performance finished, there was a notable stunned silence from the audience, before bursting into applause. Adele has since described this performance as a career defining moment.[84] Later, she performed the song at the 2011 BRIT Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 15 February 2011.[85] She appeared on stage backed just by her pianist while \\"special effects were limited to a shower of glitter and Adele's own tears, as she almost broke down delivering her lovelorn plea to an ex-boyfriend\\" as stated by Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph.[86] Speaking on the ITV2 after show, Adele explained why she had cried at the end of the performance saying, \\"I was really emotional by the end because I'm quite overwhelmed by everything anyway, and then I had a vision of my ex, of him watching me at home and he's going to be laughing at me because he knows I'm crying because of him, with him thinking, 'Yep, she's still wrapped around my finger'. Then everyone stood up, so I was overwhelmed.\\"[87] A writer of Daily Mirror said that \\"Adele stole the show [...] with her universally-praised performance of Someone Like You.\\"[85] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph chose the song as a highlight on the show saying that Adele knocked \\"everyone for six with no bells and whistles, just a piano, her gorgeous voice and a monster song, Someone Like You.\\"[88] Later, the song was performed during a VH1 special called \\"Unplugged\\".[89] Adele also performed the song at Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 24 February 2011.[90] The same day she performed \\"Someone like You\\" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.[91]\\r\\nThe singer also performed the song at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles on 28 August 2011.[92] After being introduced by American singer Katy Perry, Adele appeared in a black scalloped lace dress by Barbara Tfank,[93][94] and standing alone on the stage, only with her pianist behind her.[95] Her hair was pulled back and a signature ponytail draped over one shoulder she sang the song and \\"did vocal aerobics and dripped her soulful, sultry sound over the dark ballad, while a transfixed audience watched her\\" as stated by Kelley L. Carter of MTV.[95] After the performance she received a standing ovation from fans and critics.[96] According to USA Today's Cindy Clark she \\"captivated the audience with her powerful performance\\".[97] Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun concluded, \\"Adele's 'Someone Like You' could make a tough guy weep. Her tone was gorgeous.\\"[98] Rating the performance with A, Claire Suddath of Time magazine said \\"it's heartening to hear a truly talented woman sing a mournful torch song for someone who has left her for someone better. And if her stellar performance, accompanied by only a piano, isn't enough to melt your heart, then her nervous wave to the audience at the end definitely will.\\"[99] A writer of Los Angeles Times called her vocals \\"strong and direct, and tackles grief by moving with the melody rather than trying to pummel it\\" and added that it was \\"less-is-more performance, a tactic award-show producers rarely indulge in, but Adele needs few adornments to impress.\\"[100] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Adele brought a \\"big dollop of elegance to the VMAs with a spare, moving rendition of 'Someone Like You'\\" and added that \\"amid all the pop art glitz, it was a refreshing palate cleanser.\\"[101]\\r\\nGina Sepre of E! Online praised the performance saying, \\"When Adele took the stage to perform her understatedly stripped-down and hugely impactful performance of 'Someone Like You,' there were no pyrotechnics, no acrobatics, no lavender hair, and no autotune. And guess what? We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for.\\"[102] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that \\"Someone like You\\", \\"highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple is not a bad word, pop music.\\"[103] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: \\"When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew ÿ at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that.\\"[104] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it \\"one of the best performances of the show.\\"[105] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: \\"It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad \\"Someone Like You.\\" In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears looked like she had to fix her mascara when it was all over.\\"[106]\\r\\n\\"Someone like You\\" was also added to the set list of the second concert tour by Adele, Adele Live, and it was performed during the encore.[21][107] While reviewing a concert by Adele, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK, said \\"There wasn't a dry eye in the house as Adele powered her way through the ballad, encouraging the audience to help her sing the somewhat beautiful, yet emotional chorus ÿ giving everyone goosebumps. The sounds of Someone Like You bounced off every wall and tugged at every heart-string, making it a truly special moment and something that every member of the Apollo crowd will never forget.\\"[107] Jim Harrington of San Jose Mercury News chose the song as a highlight on the show adding that the song showed \\"her supreme vocal talent.\\"[108]\\r\\nAmber Riley, Naya Rivera and Heather Morris sang a mash-up of \\"Someone like You\\" and Adele's other song \\"Rumour Has It\\" (2011) during Glee's episode \\"Mash Off\\" which aired on 15 November.[109][110] However, the cover was posted online on 10 November.[111] Jenna Mullins of E! Online praised the cover, saying that it will \\"knock your socks right off\\"[112] and a writer for OK! described it as \\"AMAZE-ing\\".[113] Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone noted that the cover was \\"one of the greatest things the show has done [so far].\\"[114] Similarly, Billboard's Raye Votta commented that the cover was \\"arguably the best performance 'Glee' has done since 'Don't Stop Believin''.\\"[115] Their version of the song peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 while selling 160,000 digital downloads in its first week and became the fifth highest digital sales week by a Glee Cast single.[116][117] As of March 2015, it remains the ninth best-selling Glee Cast recording in the show's history, having sold 413,000 copies in the United States.[118] In Canada, the song made a \\"Hot Shot Debut\\" on the Canadian Hot 100 at number 12, selling 14,000 downloads.[119] The song peaked at #35 on the UK Singles Chart, the first Glee recording to make the UK top 40 since \\"I Feel Pretty / Unpretty\\".\\r\\nCountry musician David Nail recorded a cover of \\"Someone like You\\", which was posted on his YouTube account on 15 May 2012.

Fifth Avenue extends along the east side of Grand Army Plaza. The Plaza Hotel is recognized as a Historic Hotel of America by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.[3][4] The hotel's main entrance at 768 Fifth Avenue faces the southern portion of Grand Army Plaza, which commemorates the Union Army in the Civil War, whence its eponymous predecessor derived its name.[5][citation needed]\\r\\nConstruction on the first Plaza Hotel at this location began in 1883, on the site of the New York Skating Club. The builders ran out of money, and the New York Life Insurance Company foreclosed and hired the most celebrated architects of the era, McKim, Mead & White, to complete the hotel, which finally opened on October 1, 1890.[6]\\r\\nIt soon became apparent that the first hotel was far too small, and it was demolished in 1905. A new and larger Plaza Hotel, a French Renaissance chateau-style building designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh, was constructed in twenty-seven months at a cost of $12.5 million, opening to the public on October 1, 1907.[7] When the hotel opened, a room at the Plaza Hotel was only $2.50 per night, the equivalent of $64.26 today. The same room costs over $1,000 per night today.[8] The hotel proved so popular that a huge 300-room annex was added to the hotel along 58th Street from 1920-1921.[9]\\r\\nConrad Hilton bought the Plaza Hotel for $7.4 million in October 1943 (equivalent of $102?million today) and spent $6 million (equivalent of $83?million today) refurbishing it. The Childs Company, a national restaurant chain, purchased The Plaza from Hilton on November 18, 1955 for $6.2 million in stock (equivalent of $56.6?million today).[10] Childs had partnered in the development of the neighboring Savoy-Plaza Hotel,[11] (now the site of the General Motors Building). Childs changed its name to Hotel Corporation of America (HCA) in 1956.[12] HCA, in turn, changed its name to Sonesta International Hotels in 1970.[13] Sonesta sold the Plaza to Western International Hotels in 1975 for $25 million (equivalent of $112 million today).[14] Western International changed its name to Westin Hotels in 1980.\\r\\nWestin sold The Plaza to Donald Trump for $390 million on March 27, 1988[15] (equivalent of $790?million today). Trump commented on his purchase in a full-page open letter in The New York Times: \\"I haven't purchased a building, I have purchased a masterpiece ÿ the Mona Lisa. For the first time in my life, I have knowingly made a deal that was not economic ÿ for I can never justify the price I paid, no matter how successful the Plaza becomes.\\" Trump installed his wife, Ivana Trump as the hotel's president.[16] After $50 million in renovations, the hotel was earning a healthy operating income, but not enough to make the payments on its heavy debt load.[17] Trump made plans to pay off the hotel's debt by selling off many of its units as condominiums.[18] A deal was instead reached for the Plaza's creditors, a group of banks led by Citibank, to take a 49 percent stake in the hotel in exchange for forgiveness of $250 million in debt and an interest rate reduction.[19] The agreement was submitted as a prepackaged bankruptcy in November 1992.[20]\\r\\nIn 1995, CDL Hotels International and Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal purchased a controlling stake in the Plaza in a deal that valued it at $325 million (equivalent of $511?million today).[21]\\r\\nThe hotel was sold in 2004 for $675 million (equivalent of $856?million today) to Israeli-owned Manhattan-based developer, El Ad Properties.[22] El Ad bought the hotel with plans of adding residential and commercial sections. Since the Plaza Hotel is a New York landmark, Tishman Construction Corporation, the construction management company hired to complete the renovations and conversions, had to comply with landmark regulations.[23] El Ad temporarily closed the Plaza Hotel on April 30, 2005, for extensive renovations costing $450 million.[24] Beginning May 2005, the Plaza Hotel's contents were available to the public via a liquidation sale.\\r\\nThe hotel reopened on March 1, 2008,[25] offering 282 hotel rooms and 152 private condominium units; it is managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Diamond retailer Lev Leviev put in the first bid for a Plaza apartment at $10 million. Most of the condominium units are usually empty, used as pieds--terre by their wealthy owners.[26]\\r\\nIn November 2008 the Plaza Hotel unveiled its retail collection, an underground mall featuring luxury brands such as Vertu and Demel Bakery (closed as of March 2010), an Austrian-owned business. In 2010 the Plaza Food Hall opened in the underground mall, anchored by The Todd English Food Hall in collaboration with Chef Todd English.[27]\\r\\nOn July 31, 2012, India's business group Sahara India Pariwar agreed to buy a 75 percent controlling stake for $570 million from El Ad Properties.[28] The stake includes 100 of the Plaza's 150 hotel-condominium units and a retail portion that includes The Oak Room bar.[29]\\r\\nIn August 2014, Sahara's Subrata Roy announced he was seeking a buyer for his company's majority stake in the Plaza, along with similar stakes in the Dream Hotel in New York and the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. A $4 billion price tag was placed on the Plaza stake. Speculation that Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei would be the buyer was quashed by the sultan.[29]\\r\\nIn 2016, Saudi businessman Al-Waleed bin Talal, who already controls a 50 percent stake in the building's hotel, restaurant and retail portion through his Kingdom Holdings, partnered with Qatari Investment Authority to purchase the hotel, but the deal fell through. He partnered again in 2017 with Ashkenazy Acquisition Corp in another attempt to purchase control of the structure.[30]\\r\\nThe Plaza Hotel was accorded landmark status by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1969; it was designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1986.[2][31]\\r\\nLong the site for famous performers and guests, it has also been the meeting place for important political meetings. The nationally known singers Josephine Baker, Eartha Kitt, Liza Minnelli, Marlene Dietrich, Lena Horne, Kay Thompson, Sandler and Young, Ethel Merman, Shirley Bassey, Andy Williams, The Mills Brothers, Patti Page and Peggy Lee played the Persian Room.

Its drainage basin is 2,117,700?km2 (817,600?sq?mi) in area.[3] Its source is in the Guinea Highlands in southeastern Guinea. It runs in a crescent through Mali, Niger, on the border with Benin and then through Nigeria, discharging through a massive delta, known as the Niger Delta or the Oil Rivers, into the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. The Niger is the third-longest river in Africa, exceeded only by the Nile and the Congo River (also known as the Za?re River). Its main tributary is the Benue River.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Niger has different names in the different languages of the region:\\r\\nThe earliest use of the name \\"Niger\\" for the river is by Leo Africanus in his Della descrittione dellAfrica et delle cose notabili che iui sono published in Italian in 1550. The name may come from Berber phrase ger-n-ger meaning \\"river of rivers\\".[4] As Timbuktu was the southern end of the principal Trans-Saharan trade route to the western Mediterranean, it was the source of most European knowledge of the region.\\r\\nMedieval European maps applied the name Niger to the middle reaches of the river, in modern Mali, but Quorra (Kworra) to the lower reaches in modern Nigeria, as these were not recognized at the time as being the same river. When European colonial powers began to send ships along the west coast of Africa in the 16th and 17th centuries, the Senegal River was often postulated to be the seaward end of the Niger. The Niger Delta, pouring into the Atlantic through mangrove swamps and thousands of distributaries along more than 160 kilometres (100 miles), was thought to be no more than coastal wetlands. It was only with the 18th-century visits of Mungo Park, who travelled down the Niger River and visited the great Sahelian empires of his day, that Europeans correctly identified the course of the Niger and extended the name to its entire course.\\r\\nThe modern nations of Nigeria and Niger take their names from the river, marking contesting national claims by colonial powers of the \\"Upper\\", \\"Lower\\" and \\"Middle\\" Niger river basin during the Scramble for Africa at the end of the 19th century.\\r\\nThe Niger River is a relatively \\"clear\\" river, carrying only a tenth as much sediment as the Nile because the Niger's headwaters lie in ancient rocks that provide little silt.[5] Like the Nile, the Niger floods yearly; this begins in September, peaks in November, and finishes by May.[5]\\r\\nAn unusual feature of the river is the Inner Niger Delta, which forms where its gradient suddenly decreases.[5] The result is a region of braided streams, marshes, and lakes the size of Belgium; the seasonal floods make the Delta extremely productive for both fishing and agriculture.[6]\\r\\nThe river loses nearly two-thirds of its potential flow in the Inner Delta between Sgou and Timbuktu to seepage and evaporation. All the water from the Bani River, which flows into the Delta at Mopti, does not compensate for the 'losses'. The average 'loss' is estimated at 31?km3/year, but varies considerably between years.[7] The river is then joined by various tributaries, but also loses more water to evaporation. The quantity of water entering Nigeria measured in Yola was estimated at 25?km3/year before the 1980s and at 13.5?km3/year during the 1980s. The most important tributary of the Niger in Nigeria is the Benue River which merges with the river at Lokoja in Nigeria. The total volume of tributaries in Nigeria is six times higher than the inflow into Nigeria, with a flow near the mouth of the river standing at 177.0?km3/year before the 1980s and 147.3?km3/year during the 1980s.[7]\\r\\nThe Niger takes one of the most unusual routes of any major river, a boomerang shape that baffled geographers for two centuries. Its source is just 240?km (150?mi) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, but the river runs directly away from the sea into the Sahara Desert, then takes a sharp right turn near the ancient city of Timbuktu (Tombouctou) and heads southeast to the Gulf of Guinea.\\r\\nThis strange geography apparently came about because the Niger River is two ancient rivers joined together. The upper Niger, from the source west of Timbuktu to the bend in the current river near Timbuktu, once emptied into a now dry lake to the east northeast of Timbuktu, while the lower Niger started to the south of Timbuktu and flowed south into the Gulf of Guinea. Over time upstream erosion by the lower Niger resulted in stream capture of the upper Niger by the lower Niger.[8]\\r\\nThe northern part of the river, known as the Niger bend, is an important area because it is the major river and source of water in that part of the Sahara desert. This made it the focal point of trade across the western Sahara, and the centre of the Sahelian kingdoms of Mali and Gao.\\r\\nThe surrounding Niger River Basin is one of the distinct physiographic sections of the Sudan province, which in turn is part of the larger African massive physiographic division.\\r\\nThe origin of the river's name remains unclear. What is clear is that \\"Niger\\" was an appellation applied in the Mediterranean world from at least the Classical era, when knowledge of the area by Europeans was slightly better than fable. A careful study of Classical writings on the interior of the Sahara begins with Ptolemy, who mentions two rivers in the desert: the \\"Gir\\" and farther south, the \\"Ni-Gir\\".[9][10] The first has been since identified as the Wadi Ghir on the north western edge of the Tuat, along the borders of modern Morocco and Algeria.[9][11] This would likely have been as far as Ptolemy would have had consistent records. The Ni-Ger was likely speculation, although the name stuck as that of a river south of the Mediterranean's \\"known world\\". Suetonius reports Romans traveling to the \\"Ger\\", although in reporting any river's name derived from a Berber language, in which \\"gher\\" means \\"watercourse\\", confusion could easily arise.[12] Pliny connected these two rivers as one long watercourse which flowed (via lakes and underground sections) into the Nile,[13] a notion which persisted in the Arab and European worlds ÿ and further added the Senegal River as the \\"Ger\\" ÿ until the 19th century. The connection to the Nile River was made not simply because this was then known as the great river of \\"Aethiopia\\" (by which all lands south of the desert were called by Classical writers), but because the Nile flooded every summer. In Europe and Western Asia, floods are expected in the Spring, following snow melt. Classical authors explained the summer flood by calculating the time it took for flood waters to move down a river, and calculating how long the Nile must have been for the waters to travel from a mountain range in the spring. However the cycle of the Nile is influenced by tropical rain patterns instead of by melting snow, a characteristic unknown to the Classical Mediterranean world.[14] Through the descriptions of Leo Africanus and even Ibn Battuta ÿ despite his visit to the river ÿ the myth connecting the Niger to the Nile persisted.\\r\\nWhile the true course of the Niger was presumably known to locals, it was a mystery to the outside world until the late 18th century. Ancient Romans such as Pliny (N.H. 5.10) thought that the river near Timbuktu was part of the Nile River, a belief also held by Ibn Battuta, while early European explorers thought that it flowed west and joined the Senegal River.\\r\\nMany European expeditions to plot the river were unsuccessful. In 1788 the African Association was formed in England to promote the exploration of Africa in the hopes of locating the Niger, and in June 1796 the Scottish explorer Mungo Park was the first European to lay eyes on the middle portion of the river since antiquity (and perhaps ever). The true course was established in his book Travels in the Interior of Africa, which appeared in 1799.[15] The African Association failed in assaults from the north (Tripoli), the east (Cairo), and the west (Gambia). The membership now proposed that an effort be made from the south. The site chosen in 1804 from which to strike inland was a British trading post in the Gulf of Guinea. Unbeknownst to him, the river mouth that emptied into the Gulf, whence Henry Nicholls was to set out in search of the Niger, was precisely the end of the Niger itselfonly the Europeans did not know it yet. The starting point of the expedition was in fact its destination.[16]\\r\\nOn October 24, 1946 three Frenchmen, Jean Sauvy, Pierre Ponty and movie maker Jean Rouch, former civil servants in the African French colonies, set out to travel the entire length of the river, as no one else seemed to have done previously. They travelled from the very beginning of the river near Kissidougou in Guinea, walking at first till a raft could be used, then changing to various local crafts as the river broadened and changed. Two of them reached the ocean on March 25, 1947, with Pierre Ponty having had to leave the expedition at Niamey, somewhat past the halfway mark. They carried a 16mm movie camera, the resulting footage giving Jean Rouch his first two ethnographic documentaries: \\"Au pays des mages noirs\\", and \\"La chasse  lhippopotame\\". A camera was used to illustrate Jean Rouch's subsequent book \\"Le Niger En Pirogue\\" (Fernand Nathan, 1954), as well as Jean Sauvys Descente du Niger (L'Harmattan 2001). A typewriter was brought as well, on which Pierre Ponty produced newspaper articles he mailed out whenever possible.[17]\\r\\nMore recently, Norwegian adventurer Helge Hjelland made another journey through the entire length of the Niger River starting in Guinea-Bissau in 2005. The trip was filmed by the adventurer himself and made into a documentary titled \\"The Cruellest Journey\\".[18]\\r\\nThe water in the Niger River basin is partially regulated through dams. In Mali the Slingu Dam on the Sankarani River is mainly used for hydropower, but also permits irrigation. Two diversion dams, one at Sotuba just downstream of Bamako, and one at Markala, just downstream of Sgou, are used to irrigate about 54,000 hectares.[7] In Nigeria the Kainji Dam and the Jebba dam are used to generate hydropower.\\r\\nThe water resources of the Niger River are under pressure due to increased water abstraction for irrigation and due to the impact of climate change. The construction of dams for hydropower generation is underway or envisaged in order to alleviate chronic power shortages in the countries of the Niger basin.[19]\\r\\nThe FAO estimates the irrigation potential of all countries in the Niger river basin at 2.8 million hectares. Only 0.93m hectares (ha) were under irrigation in the late 1980s. The irrigation potential was estimated at 1.68m ha in Nigeria 0.56m ha in Mali, and the actual irrigated area was 0.67m ha and 0.19m ha.[7]\\r\\nIn order to further coordinate their efforts, in April 2008 the riparian countries which form the Niger Basin Authority adopted a Niger Basin Water Charta, a basin-wide 30-year investment plan and a 5-year priority investment plan. The Charta promotes Integrated Water Resources Management, defines procedures for the examination and approval of new projects, provides a framework for the allocation of water resources between sectors, commits to maintain the integrity of aquatic ecosystems and defines mechanisms for the settlement of disputes between countries and for user participation. Investments include the expansion of irrigated agriculture to improve food security, the construction of the Taoussa (or Tossaye) dam in Mali and the Kandadji Dam in Niger (the latter has been under construction since August 2008), as well as the rehabilitation of the Kainji dam and Jebba dam in Nigeria.[a]\\r\\nMost of the investments are funded or are expected to be funded through aid. For example, the Kandadji Dam is financed by the Islamic Development Bank, the African Development Bank and the OPEC Development Fund. The World Bank approved a US$500 million soft loan in July 2007 to finance projects in the basin over a 12-year period. Funding will be awarded in two phases. The initial $185 million credit will go to Nigeria, Guinea, Benin, Mali and Niger. The second, $315 million investment, is slated for Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad and Ivory Coast.[22] Besides financing the rehabilitation of dams in Nigeria, the loan will also fund the \\"sustainable management of selected degraded ecosystems and rehabilitation of small water infrastructure\\" and capacity building.[23]\\r\\nIn September 2009, the Nigerian government commenced a 36 billion naira dredging of the Niger River from Baro to Warri, a move which will see silt removed from several hundred kilometres.[24] The dredging is intended to make it easier for goods to be transported to isolated settlements located deep within from the Atlantic Ocean.[24] Estimated to be completed within six to eight months, it had first been proposed and then postponed for 43 years previously by the then government.[24][25] Speaking in Lokoja, Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua stated that the project would lead to \\"all-year-round navigability\\" on the River Niger and that he hoped that, by 2020, Nigeria would have become one of the twenty most industrialised nations in the world.[24][25] Alhaji Ibrahim Bio, the Nigerian Minister of Transport, said his ministry would work to make certain the project would be completed within its designated timeframe.[25] Some activists have, however, opposed the project in the past, claiming it may have negative effects on waterside villagers.[24]\\r\\nIn late March 2010 the dredging project was 50% complete.[26]\\r\\nCoordinates: 110436N 91846W? / ?11.076638N 9.312839W? / 11.076638; -9.312839","input":"What is the source of the river niger?"},{"output":"approximately 200","context":"This is a list of the mammal species recorded in Canada.

Flyorov wrote a letter to Stalin urging him to start this program in 1942.[9]:78ÿ79 Initial efforts were slowed due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union and remained largely composed of the intelligence knowledge gained from the spy rings working in the U.S.' Manhattan Project in 1943.[2]\\r\\nAfter learning of the atomic bombings of Japanese cities that officially ended World War II in 1945, the program was aggressively pursued, mainly through effective intelligence gathering about the German weapon project and the American Manhattan Project.[10] The Russian efforts also rounded up captured German scientists to join their program, and relied heavily on knowledge passed by the spy ring to the Russian intelligence agencies .[11]:242ÿ243\\r\\nOn 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union secretly conducted its first successful weapon test (First Lightning), based on the U.S. design at the Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs early as 1910 in Russia, independent research was being conducted on radioactive elements by several Russian scientists.:44[12]:24ÿ25[13] Despite the hardship faced by the Russian academy of sciences during the national revolution in 1917, followed by the violent civil war in 1922, the Russian scientists had made remarkable efforts towards the advancement of physics research in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.[14]:35ÿ36 Before the first revolution in 1905, the mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky had made a number of public calls for a survey of Russia's uranium deposits but none were heeded.[14]:37\\r\\nHowever, such early efforts were independently and privately funded by various organizations until 1922 when the Radium Institute in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) opened and industrialized the research.:44[12]\\r\\nFrom the 1920s until the late 1930s, Russian physicists had been conducting joint research with their European counterparts on the advancement of atomic physics at the Cavendish Laboratory run by a British physicist, Ernest Rutherford, where Georgi Gamov and Pyotr Kapitsa had studied and researched.[14]:36\\r\\nInfluential research towards the advancement of nuclear physics was guided by Abram Ioffe, who was the director at the Leningrad Physical-Technical Institute (LPTI), having sponsored various research program at various technical schools in the Soviet Union.[14]:36 The discovery of the neutron by the British physicist James Chadwick further provided promising expansion of the LPTI's program, with the operation of the first cyclotron to energies of over 1 MeV, and the first \\"splitting\\" of the atomic nucleus by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton.[14]:36ÿ37 Russian physicists began pushing the government, lobbying in the interest of the development of science in the Soviet Union, which had received little interest due to the upheavals created during the Russian revolution and the February Revolution.[14]:36ÿ37 Earlier research was directed towards the medical and scientific exploration of radium, that could be retrieved from borehole water from the Ukhta oilfields.[14]:37\\r\\nIn 1939, German chemist Otto Hahn reported his discovery of fission, achieved by the splitting of uranium with neutrons that produced the much lighter element barium. This eventually led to the realization among Russian scientists, and their American counterparts, that such reaction could have military significance.:20[15] The discovery excited the Russian physicists, and they began conducting their independent investigations on nuclear fission, mainly aiming towards power generation, as many were skeptical of possibility of creating an atomic bomb anytime soon.:25[16] Early efforts were led by Yakov Frenkel (a physicist specialised on condensed matter), who did the first theoretical calculations on continuum mechanics directly relating the kinematics of binding energy in fission process in 1940.:99[15] Georgy Flyorov's and Lev Rusinov's collaborative work on thermal reactions concluded that 3-1 neutrons were emitted per fission only days after similar conclusions had been reached by the team of Frdric Joliot-Curie.:63[15]:200[17]\\r\\nAfter a strong lobbying of Russian scientists, the Soviet government did initially set up a commission that was to address the \\"uranium problem\\" and investigate the possibility of chain reaction and Isotope separation.:33[18] The Uranium Problem Commission was ineffective due to the German invasion of Soviet Union that eventually limited the focus on research as Russia became engaged in a bloody conflict along the Eastern Front for next four years.:114ÿ115[19]:200[20] The Soviet atomic weapons program had no significance and most work was unclassified as the papers were continuously published as public domain on academic journals.:33[18]\\r\\nJoseph Stalin, the Soviet leader, had mostly disregarded the atomic knowledge possessed by the Russian scientists and had most of the scientists working in the metallurgy and mining industry or serving in the Soviet Armed Forces technical branches during the World War II's eastern front in 1940ÿ42.:xx[21]\\r\\nIn 1940ÿ42, Georgy Flyorov, a Russian physicist serving as an officer in the Soviet Air Force, noted that despite progress in other areas of physics, the German, British, and American scientists had ceased publishing papers on nuclear science; clearly they each had active secret research programs.:230[22]\\r\\nIn April 1942, Flyorov directed two classified letters to Stalin, warning him of the consequences of the development of atomic weapons: \\"...the results will be so overriding [that] it won't be necessary to determine who is to blame for the fact that this work has been neglected in our country.\\":xxx[23] The second letter, by Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak, highly emphasized the importance of a \\"uranium bomb\\": \\"it is essential to manufacture a uranium bomb without a delay.\\":230[22]\\r\\nUpon reading the Flyorov letters, Stalin immediately pulled Russian physicists from their respective military services and authorized an atomic bomb project, under engineering physicist Anatoly Alexandrov and nuclear physicist Igor V. Kurchatov.:230[22]:xx[21] For this purpose, the Laboratory No. 2 near Moscow was established under Kurchatov.:230[22] At the same time, Flyorov was moved to Dubna, where he established the Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, focusing on synthetic elements and thermal reactions.:xx[21] In late 1942, the State Defense Committee officially delegated the program to the Soviet Army, with major wartime logistical efforts later being supervised by Lavrentiy Beria, the head of NKVD.:115:114ÿ115[19]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Arzamas 16 site near Moscow was established under Yakov Zel'dovich and Yuli Khariton who performed calculations on nuclear combustion theory, alongside Isaak Pomeranchuk.:117ÿ118[24] Despite early and accelerated efforts, it was reported by historians that efforts on building a bomb using weapon-grade uranium seemed hopeless to Russian scientists.:117ÿ118[24] Igor Kurchatov had harboured doubts working towards the uranium bomb, made progress on a bomb using weapon-grade plutonium after British data was provided by the NKVD.:117ÿ118[24]\\r\\nThe situation dramatically changed when the Soviet Union learned of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, which eventually led to the unilateral surrender of Japan to the United States, ending the war in Asia.:2ÿ5[25]\\r\\nImmediately after the atomic bombing, the Soviet Politburo took control of the atomic bomb project by establishing a special committee to oversee the development of nuclear weapons as soon as possible.:2ÿ5[25] On 9 April 1946, the Council of Ministers created the KBÿ11 Design Bureau that worked towards mapping the first nuclear weapon design, primarily based on American approach and detonated with weapon-grade plutonium.:2ÿ5[25] From this point, the work on the program was carried out quickly, resulting in the first nuclear reactor near Moscow on 25 October 1946.:2ÿ5[25]\\r\\nFrom 1941ÿ46, the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Affairs handled the logistics of the atomic bomb project, with Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov controlling the direction of the program.:33[26] However, Molotov proved to be a weak administrator, and the program stagnated.[27] In contrast to American military administration in their atomic bomb project, the Russians' program was directed by political dignitaries such as Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria, Georgii Malenkov, and Mikhail Pervukhin  there were no military members.[28]\\r\\nAfter the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the program's leadership changed, when Stalin appointed Lavrentiy Beria on 22 August 1945.[27] Beria is noted for leadership that helped the program to its final implementation.[27]\\r\\nBeria understood the necessary scope and dynamics of research. This man, who was the personification of evil to modern Russian history, also possessed the great energy and capacity to work. The scientists who met him could not fail to recognize his intelligence, his will power, and his purposefullness. They found him first-class administrator who could carry a job through to completion...\\r\\nThe new Committee, under Beria, retained Georgii Malenkov and added Nikolai Voznesensky and Boris Vannikov, People's Commissar for Armament.[27] Under the administration of Beria, the NKVD co-opted atomic spies of the Soviet Atomic Spy Ring into the Western Allied program, and infiltrated the German nuclear program.[27]\\r\\nThe atomic and industrial espionages in the United States by American sympathisers of communism who were controlled by their rezident Russian officials in North America greatly aided the speed of the Soviet atomic project from 1942ÿ54.:105ÿ106[29]:287ÿ305[30] Willingness of sharing classified information to Soviet Union by recruited American communist sympathizers increased when the Soviet Union faced possible defeat during the German invasion in World War II.:287ÿ289[30] The Russian intelligence network in the United Kingdom also played a vital role in setting up the spy rings in the United States when the Russian State Defense Committee approved resolution 2352[clarification needed], in September 1942.:105ÿ106[29]\\r\\nFor this purpose, the spy Harry Gold, controlled by Semyon Semyonov, was used for a wide range of espionage that included industrial espionage in the American chemical industry and obtaining sensitive atomic information that were handed over to him by the British physicist Klaus Fuchs.:289ÿ290[30] Knowledge and further technical information that were passed by the American Theodore Hall, a theoretical physicist, and Klaus Fuchs had a significant impact on the direction of Russian development of nuclear weapons.:105[29]\\r\\nLeonid Kvasnikov, a Russian chemical engineer turned KGB officer, was assigned for this special purpose and moved to New York City to coordinate such activities.[31] Anatoli Yatzkov, another NKVD official in New York, was also involved in obtaining sensitive information gathered by Sergei Kournakov from Saville Sax.[31]\\r\\nThe existence of Russian spies were exposed by the U.S. Army's secretive Venona project in 1943.:54[32]\\r\\nFor example, Soviet work on methods of uranium isotope separation was altered when it was reported, to Kurchatov's surprise, that the Americans had opted for the Gaseous diffusion method. While research on other separation methods continued throughout the war years, the emphasis was placed on replicating U.S. success with gaseous diffusion. Another important breakthrough, attributed to intelligence, was the possibility of using plutonium instead of uranium in a fission weapon. Extraction of plutonium in the so-called \\"uranium pile\\" allowed bypassing of the difficult process of uranium separation altogether, something that Kurchatov had learned from intelligence from the Manhattan project.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1945, the Soviet intelligence obtained rough blueprints of the first U.S. atomic device.[33][34] Alexei Kojevnikov has estimated, based on newly released Soviet documents, that the primary way in which the espionage may have sped up the Soviet project was that it allowed Khariton to avoid dangerous tests to determine the size of the critical mass: \\"tickling the dragon's tail,\\" as it was called in the U.S., consumed a good deal of time and claimed at least two lives; see Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin.\\r\\nThe published Smyth Report of 1945 on the Manhattan Project was translated into Russian, and the translators noted that a sentence on the effect of \\"poisoning\\" of Plutonium-239 in the first (lithograph) edition had been deleted from the next (Princeton) edition by Groves. This change was noted by the Russian translators, and alerted the Soviet Union to the problem (which had meant that reactor-bred plutonium could not be used in a simple gun-type bomb like the proposed Thin Man).\\r\\nOne of the key pieces of information, which Soviet intelligence obtained from Fuchs, was a cross-section for D-T fusion. This data was available to top Soviet officials roughly three years before it was openly published in the Physical Review in 1949. However, this data was not forwarded to Vitaly Ginzburg or Andrei Sakharov until very late, practically months before publication.[citation needed] Initially both Ginzburg and Sakharov estimated such a cross-section to be similar to the D-D reaction. Once the actual cross-section become known to Ginzburg and Sakharov, the Sloika design become a priority, which resulted in a successful test in 1953.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, with the declassification of Soviet intelligence materials, which showed the extent and the type of the information obtained by the Soviets from US sources, a heated debate ensued in Russia and abroad as to the relative importance of espionage, as opposed to the Soviet scientists' own efforts, in the making of the Soviet bomb. The vast majority of scholars[Like whom?] agree that whereas the Soviet atomic project was first and foremost a product of local expertise and scientific talent, it is clear that espionage efforts contributed to the project in various ways and most certainly shortened the time needed to develop the atomic bomb.[citation needed]\\r\\nComparing the timelines of H-bomb development, some researchers came to the conclusion that the Soviets had a gap in access to classified information regarding the H-bomb at least between late 1950 and some time in 1953. Earlier, e.g., in 1948, Fuchs gave the Soviets a detailed update of the classical super progress[clarification needed], including an idea to use lithium, but did not explain it was specifically lithium-6. Teller accepted the fact that \\"classical super\\" scheme was infeasible by 1951, following results obtained by various researchers (including Stanislaw Ulam) and calculations performed by John von Neumann in late 1950.\\r\\nYet the research for the Soviet analogue of \\"classical super\\" continued until December 1953, when the researchers were reallocated to a new project working on what later became a true H-bomb design, based on radiation implosion. This remains an open topic for research, whether the Soviet intelligence was able to obtain any specific data on Teller-Ulam design in 1953 or early 1954. Yet, Soviet officials directed the scientists to work on a new scheme, and the entire process took less than two years, commencing around January 1954 and producing a successful test in November 1955. It also took just several months before the idea of radiation implosion was conceived, and there is no documented evidence claiming priority. It is also possible that Soviets were able to obtain a document lost by John Wheeler on a train in 1953, which reportedly contained key information about thermonuclear weapon design.\\r\\nEarly ideas of the fusion bomb came from espionage and internal Soviet studies. Though the espionage did help Soviet studies, the early American H-bomb concepts had substantial flaws, so it may have confused, rather than assisted, the Soviet effort for a nuclear bomb.[35] The designers of early thermonuclear bombs envisioned using an atomic bomb as a trigger to provide the needed heat and compression to initiate the thermonuclear reaction in a layer of liquid deuterium between the fissile material and the surrounding chemical high explosive.[36] The group would realize that a lack of sufficient heat and compression of the deuterium would result in an insignificant fusion of the deuterium fuel.[36]\\r\\nAndrei Sakharovs study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept which was adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.[36] It was also known as the RDS-6S, or Second Idea Bomb.[37] This second bomb idea was not a fully evolved thermonuclear bomb in the contemporary sense, but a crucial step between pure fission bombs and the thermonuclear supers.[38] Due to the three-year lag in making the key breakthrough of radiation compression from the United States the Soviet Unions development efforts followed a different course of action. In the United States they decided to skip the single-stage fusion bomb and make a two-stage fusion bomb as their main effort.[36][39] Unlike the Soviet Union, the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb was not further developed, and instead, the single-stage 400-kiloton RDS-6S was the Soviets bomb of choice.[36] The RDS-6S Layer Cake design was detonated on 12 August 1953, producing a yield of 400 kilotons, about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test. Around this time the United States detonated its first super using radiation compression on 1 November 1952, code-named Mike. Though the Mike was about twenty times greater than the RDS-6S, it was not a design that was practical to use, unlike the RDS-6S.[36]\\r\\nFollowing the successful launching of the RDS-6S, Sakharov proposed an upgraded version called RDS-6SD.[36] This bomb was proved to be faulty, and it was neither built nor tested. The Soviet team had been working on the RDS-6T concept, but it also proved to be a dead end. In 1954, Sakharov worked on a third concept, a two-stage thermonuclear bomb.[36] The third idea used the radiation wave of a fission bomb, not simply heat and compression, to ignite the fusion reaction, and paralleled the discovery made by Ulam and Teller. Unlike the RDS-6S boosted bomb, which placed the fusion fuel inside the primary A-bomb trigger, the thermonuclear super placed the fusion fuel in a secondary structure a small distance from the A-bomb trigger, where it was compressed and ignited by the A-bombs x-ray radiation.[36] The KB-11 Scientific-Technical Council approved plans to proceed with the design on 24 December 1954. Technical specifications for the new bomb were completed on 3 February 1955, and it was designated the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nThe RDS-37 was successfully tested on 22 November 1955 with a yield of 1.6 megaton. The yield was almost a hundred times greater than the first Soviet atomic bomb six years before, showing that the Soviet Union could compete with the United States.[36][40]\\r\\nThe single largest problem during the early Soviet project was the procurement of uranium ore, as the USSR had no known domestic sources at the beginning of the project. The Soviet F-1 reactor, which began operation in December 1946, was fueled using uranium confiscated from the remains of the German atomic bomb project. This uranium had been mined in the Belgian Congo, and the ore in Belgium fell into the hands of the Germans after their invasion and occupation of Belgium in 1940 (although Edgar Sengier sold the rich Shinkolobwe ore from the Congo, some of which was held in America, to America). Further sources of uranium in the early years of the program were mines in East Germany (SAG Wismut), Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania (near Stei) and Poland. Boris Pregel sold 0.23 tonnes of uranium oxide to the Soviet Union during the war, with the authorisation of the U.S. Government.[41][42][43]\\r\\nEventually, large domestic sources were discovered in the Soviet Union (including those now in Kazakhstan).\\r\\nThe uranium for the Soviet nuclear weapons program came from mine production in the following countries,[44]\\r\\nRDS-1, the first Soviet atomic test was internally code-named First Lightning (楿־ 񶶷, or Pervaya Molniya) August 29, 1949, and was code-named by the Americans as Joe 1. The design was very similar to the first US \\"Fat Man\\" plutonium bomb, using a TNT/hexogen implosion lens design.\\r\\nOn September 24, 1951, the 38.3 kiloton device RDS-2 was tested based on a tritium \\"boosted\\" uranium implosion device with a levitated core.[45] This test was code named Joe 2 by the CIA.\\r\\nRDS-3 was the third Soviet atomic bomb. On October 18, 1951, the 41.2 kiloton device was detonated - a boosted weapon using a composite construction of levitated plutonium core and a uranium-235 shell. Code named Joe 3 in the USA, this was the first Soviet air-dropped bomb test. Released at an altitude of 10?km, it detonated 400 meters above the ground.\\r\\nRDS-4 represented a branch of research on small tactical weapons. It was a boosted fission device using plutonium in a \\"levitated\\" core design. The first test was an air drop on August 23, 1953, yielding 28 kilotons. In 1954, the bomb was also used during Snowball exercise in Totskoye, dropped by Tu-4 bomber on the simulated battlefield, in the presence of 40,000 infantry, tanks, and jet fighters. The RDS-4 comprised the warhead of the R-5M, the first medium-range ballistic missile in the world, which was tested with a live warhead for the first and only time on February 5, 1956\\r\\nRDS-5 was a small plutonium based device, probably using a hollow core. Two different versions were made and tested.\\r\\nRDS-6, the first Soviet test of a hydrogen bomb, took place on August 12, 1953, and was nicknamed Joe 4 by the Americans. It used a layer-cake design of fission and fusion fuels (uranium 235 and lithium-6 deuteride) and produced a yield of 400 kilotons. This yield was about ten times more powerful than any previous Soviet test.[36] When developing higher level bombs, the Soviets proceeded with the RDS-6 as their main effort instead of the analog RDS-7 advanced fission bomb. This led to the third idea bomb which is the RDS-37.[36]\\r\\nA much lower-power version of the RDS-4 with a 3-10 kiloton yield, the RDS-9 was developed for the T-5 nuclear torpedo. A 3.5 kiloton underwater test was performed with the torpedo on September 21, 1955.\\r\\nThe first Soviet test of a \\"true\\" hydrogen bomb in the megaton range was conducted on November 22, 1955. It was dubbed RDS-37 by the Soviets. It was of the multi-staged, radiation implosion thermonuclear design called Sakharov's \\"Third Idea\\" in the USSR and the Teller-Ulam design in the USA.[46]\\r\\nJoe 1, Joe 4, and RDS-37 were all tested at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan.\\r\\nThe Tsar Bomba (ђ^-ɾ񼼼) was the largest, most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated. It was a three-stage hydrogen bomb with a yield of about 50 megatons.[47] This is equivalent to ten times the amount of all the explosives used in World War II combined.[48] It was detonated on October 30, 1961, in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, and was capable of approximately 100 megatons, but was purposely reduced shortly before the launch. Although weaponized, it was not entered into service; it was simply a demonstrative testing of the capabilities of the Soviet Union's military technology at that time. The heat of the explosion was estimated to potentially inflict third degree burns at 100?km distance of clear air.[49]\\r\\nChagan was a shot in the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy or Project 7, the Soviet equivalent of the US Operation Plowshare to investigate peaceful uses of nuclear weapons. It was a subsurface detonation. It was fired on January 15, 1965. The site was a dry bed of the Chagan River at the edge of the Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant crater had a diameter of 408 meters and was 100 meters deep. A major lake (10,000?m3) soon formed behind the 20ÿ35?m high upraised lip, known as Chagan Lake or Balapan Lake.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe photo is sometimes confused with RDS-1 in literature.\\r\\nDuring the Cold War, the Soviet Union created at least nine closed cities, known as Atomgrads[citation needed], in which nuclear weapons-related research and development took place. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, all of the cities changed their names (most of the original code-names were simply the oblast and a number). All are still legally \\"closed\\", though some have parts of them accessible to foreign visitors with special permits (Sarov, Snezhinsk, and Zheleznogorsk).\\r\\nThe Soviets started experimenting with nuclear technology in 1943, and first tested a nuclear weapon in August 1949. Many of the fission based devices left behind radioactive isotopes which have contaminated air, water and soil in the areas immediately surrounding, downwind and downstream of the blast site. According to the records that the Russian government released in 1991, the Soviet Union tested 969 nuclear devices between 1949 and 1990.[50]:1 Soviet scientists conducted the tests with little regard for environmental and public health consequences. The detrimental effects that the toxic waste generated by weapons testing and processing of radioactive materials are still felt to this day. Even decades later, the risk of developing various types of cancer, especially that of the thyroid and the lungs, continues to be elevated far above national averages for people in affected areas.[51]:1385 Iodine-131, a radioactive isotope that is a major byproduct of fission-based weapons, is retained in the thyroid gland, and so poisoning of this kind is commonplace in impacted populations.[51]:1386\\r\\nThe Soviets set off 214 nuclear bombs in the open air between 1949 and 1962, when the United Nations banned atmospheric tests worldwide.[50]:6 The billions of radioactive particles released into the air exposed countless people to extremely mutagenic and carcinogenic materials, resulting in a myriad of deleterious genetic maladies and deformities. The majority of these tests took place at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, or STS, located in northeast Kazakhstan.[50]:61 The testing at STS alone exposed hundreds of thousands of Kazakh citizens to the harmful effects, and the site continues to be one of the most highly irradiated places on the planet.[52]:A167 When the earliest tests were being conducted, even the scientists had only a poor understanding of the medium- and long-term effects of radiation exposure. In fact, the STS was chosen as the primary site for open-air testing precisely because the Soviets were curious about the potential for lasting harm that their weapons held.[51]:1389\\r\\nContamination of air and soil due to atmospheric testing is only part of a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent nuclear fuel elements that remain in the sunken vessels.[52]:A166 There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination.[52]:A166 Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination in the area of the Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake.[52]:A165 Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans.[52]:A165 Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks.[52]:A165 To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with standing underground groundwater.[52]:A166 It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.\\r\\nContemporary efforts to manage radioactive contamination in the Soviet Union are few and far between. Public awareness of the past and present dangers, as well as the Russian government's investment in current cleanup efforts, are likely dampened by the lack of media attention STS and other sites have gotten in comparison to isolated nuclear incidents such as Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island.[53] The domestic government's investment in cleanup measures seems to be driven by economic concerns rather than care for public health. The most significant political legislation in this area is a bill agreeing to turn the already contaminated former weapons complex Mayak into an international radioactive waste dump, accepting cash from other countries in exchange for taking their radioactive byproducts of nuclear industry.[52]:A167 Although the bill stipulates that the revenue go towards decontaminating other test sites such as Semipalatinsk and the Kona Peninsula, experts doubt whether this will actually happen given the current political and economic climate in Russia.[52]:A168","input":"When did the soviet union explode its first atomic bomb?"},{"output":"120 to 187","context":"There are some 120 to 187[5] languages and dialects in the Philippines, depending on the method of classification.[6] Almost all are Malayo-Polynesian languages, whereas one, Chavacano, is a creole derived from Spanish, a Romance language.

Luciano de la Rosa established that Spanish was spoken by a total of 60% of the population in the early 20th century as a first, second or third language. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the use of Spanish declined gradually, especially after the 1940s.\\r\\nUnder the U.S. occupation and civil regime, English began to be taught in schools. By 1901, public education used English as the medium of instruction. Around 600 educators (called \\"Thomasites\\") who arrived in that year aboard the USAT Thomas replaced the soldiers who also functioned as teachers. The 1935 Constitution added English as an official language alongside Spanish. A provision in this constitution also called for Congress to \\"take steps toward the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.\\" On November 12, 1937, the First National Assembly created the National Language Institute. President Manuel L. Quez܇n appointed native Waray speaker Jaime C. De Veyra to chair a committee of speakers of other regional languages. Their aim was to select a national language among the other regional languages. Ultimately, Tagalog was chosen as the base language December 30, 1937, on the basis that it was the most widely spoken and developed local language.[12]\\r\\nIn 1939, President Manuel L. Quez܇n renamed the Tagalog language as Wikang Pambansa (\\"national language\\" in English translation).[13] The language was further renamed in 1959 as Pilipino by Secretary of Education Jose Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Pilipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a national language, to be known as Filipino. In addition, Spanish regained its official status when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155, s. 1973.[14]\\r\\nThe present constitution, ratified in 1987, designates Filipino and English as joint official languages. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be \\"developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.\\" Although not explicitly stated in the constitution, Filipino is in practice almost completely composed of the Tagalog language as spoken in the capital, Manila; however, organizations such as the University of the Philippines began publishing dictionaries such as the UP Diksyonaryong Filipino in which words from various Philippine languages were also included. The constitution also made mention of Spanish and Arabic, both of which are to be promoted on a voluntary and optional basis.\\r\\nFilipino is an official language of education and also the major language of the broadcast media and cinema, but less important than English as a language of publication (except in some domains, like comic books) and less important for academic-scientific-technological discourse. Filipino is used as a lingua franca in all regions of the Philippines as well as within overseas Filipino communities, and is the dominant language of the armed forces (except perhaps for the small part of the commissioned officer corps from wealthy or upper-middle-class families) and of a large part of the civil service, most of whom are non-Tagalogs.\\r\\nThere are different forms of diglossia that exist in the case of regional languages. Locals may use their mother tongue or the regional lingua franca to communicate amongst themselves, but sometimes switch to foreign languages when addressing outsiders. Another is the prevalence of code-switching to English when speaking in both their first language and Tagalog.\\r\\nThe Constitution of the Philippines provides for the use of the vernacular languages as official auxiliary languages in provinces where Filipino is not the lingua franca. This is however not implemented as Filipinos at large are polyglots. In the case where the vernacular language is a regional language, Filipinos would speak in Filipino when speaking in formal situations while the regional languages are spoken in non-formal settings. This is evident in major urban areas outside Metro Manila like Camarines Norte in the Bikol-speaking area, and Davao in the Cebuano-speaking area. As of 2017[update], the case of Ilocano and Cebuano are becoming more of bilingualism than diglossia due to the publication of materials written in these languages.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe diglossia is more evident in the case of other languages such as Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Bikol, Waray, Hiligaynon, Sambal, and Maranao, where the written variant of the language is becoming less and less popular to give way to the use of Filipino. Although Philippine laws consider some of these languages as \\"major languages\\" there is little, if any, support coming from the government to preserve these languages. This may be bound to change, however, given current policy trends.[15]\\r\\nThere still exists another type of diglossia, which is between the regional languages and the minority languages. Here, we label the regional languages as acrolects while the minority languages as the basilect. In this case, the minority language is spoken only in very intimate circles, like the family or the tribe one belongs to. Outside this circle, one would speak in the prevalent regional language, while maintaining an adequate command of Filipino for formal situations. Unlike the case of the regional languages, these minority languages are always in danger of becoming extinct because of speakers favoring the more prevalent regional language. Moreover, most of the users of these languages are illiterate[specify] and as expected, there is a chance that these languages will no longer be revived due to lack of written records.\\r\\nAccording to Ethnologue, a total of 182 native languages are spoken in the nation and four languages have been classified as extinct: Dicamay Agta, Katabaga, Tayabas Ayta and Villaviciosa Agta.[16] Except for English, Spanish, Chavacano and varieties of Chinese (Hokkien, Cantonese and Mandarin), all of the languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian language family of the Austronesian superfamily.\\r\\nThere are 13 indigenous languages with at least one million native speakers:\\r\\nOne or more of these is spoken natively by more than 90% of the population.\\r\\nA Philippine language sub-family identified by Robert Blust includes languages of north Sulawesi and the Yami language of Taiwan, but excludes the SamaÿBajaw languages of the Tawi-Tawi islands, as well as a couple of North Bornean languages spoken in southern Palawan.\\r\\nEskayan is an artificial auxiliary language created as the embodiment of a Bohol nation in the aftermath of the PhilippineÿAmerican War. It is used by about 500 people.\\r\\nPhilippine languages are often referred to by Filipinos as dialects, partly as a relic of the inaccurate vocabulary used in literature during the American period (1898ÿ1946).[13] While there are indeed many hundreds of dialects in the Philippines, they represent variations of no fewer than 120 distinct languages, and many of these languages maintain greater differences than those between established European languages like French and Spanish.\\r\\nThe vast differences between the languages can be seen in the following translations of the Philippine national proverb:\\r\\nThe amount of dialectal variation varies from language to language. Languages like Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are known to have very moderate dialectal variation.\\r\\nThe languages of the Bicol Region, however, there is great dialectal variation. There are cities and towns which have their own dialects and varieties. Below is the sentence \\"Were you there at the market for a long time?\\" translated into certain varieties of Bikol. The translation is followed by dialect and corresponding language, and a city/town in Bicol where they are spoken. The final translation is in Tagalog.\\r\\nBelow is a chart of Philippine languages. While there have been misunderstandings on which ones should be classified as language and which ones should be classified as dialect, the chart confirms that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the regions they are natively spoken (from north to south, then east to west).\\r\\nThere is a language spoken by the Tao people (also known as Yami) of Orchid Island of Taiwan which is not included in the language of the Philippines. Their language, Tao (or Yami) is part of the Batanic languages which includes Ivatan, Babuyan, and Itbayat of the Batanes.\\r\\nBelow are population estimates from the 2000 Philippine census by the Philippine Statistics Authority on the number of Filipinos who speak the following 18 languages as a native language.\\r\\nEndangered and extinct languages in the Philippines are based on the 3rd world volume released by UNESCO in 2010.\\r\\nDegree of endangerment (UNESCO standard)\\r\\nIn a separate study by Thomas N. Headland, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, and the University of North Dakota called Thirty Endangered Languages in the Philippines, the Philippines has 32 endangered languages, but 2 of the listed languages in the study are written with 0 speakers, noting that they are extinct or probably extinct. All of the listed languages are Negrito languages, the oldest languages in the Philippines.[19]\\r\\nArabic is used by some Filipino Muslims in both a liturgical and instructional capacity since the arrival of Islam and establishment of several Sultanates in the 14th century. Along with Malay, Arabic was the lingua franca of the Malay Archipelago among Muslim traders and the Malay aristocracy.\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution mandates that Arabic (along with Spanish) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. As of 2015[update] Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines. It is used primarily in religious activities and education (such as in a madrasa or Islamic school) and rarely for official events or daily conversation. In this respect, its function and use is somewhat like the traditional roles of Latin and Spanish in Filipino Catholicism vis--vis other currently spoken languages.\\r\\nThe first significant exposure of Filipinos to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British invaded Manila, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines.\\r\\nEnglish is used in official documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino.[dubious ÿ discuss] However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies.[citation needed] A percentage of the media such as cable television and newspapers are also in English; major television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino. However, a 2009 article by a UNICEF worker reported that the level of spoken English language in the Philippines was poor. The article reported that aspiring Filipino teachers score the lowest in English out of all of the subjects on their licensing exams.[20]\\r\\nA large influx of English (American English) words has been assimilated into Tagalog and the other native languages called Taglish or Bislish. There is a debate, however, on whether there is diglossia or bilingualism, between Filipino and English. Filipino is also used both in formal and informal situations. Though the masses would prefer to speak in Filipino, government officials tend to speak in English when performing government functions.[according to whom?] There is still resistance to the use of Filipino in courts and the drafting of national statutes.\\r\\nOn August 22, 2007, three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan decided to use Filipino, instead of English, in order to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. De la Rama said it was the dream of former Chief Justice Reynato Puno to implement the program in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quez܇n, Nueva cija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila.[21]\\r\\nDiplomatic ties with the Ming dynasty among some established states or kingdoms in Luzon and direct interactions and trade overall within the archipelago as a whole may go as far back as the early 10th century. Mandarin Chinese is the medium of instruction in Chinese schools and the lingua franca of mainland and overseas Chinese. The Lan-nang variant of Hokkien Chinese is the language of the majority the Chinese in the Philippines, who immigrated from the Fujian (pronounced locally as Fukien or Hokkien) province in China. Other varieties of Chinese such as Hakka and Cantonese, are spoken among the Chinese in the Philippines who are descendants of people from Guangdong province in China.\\r\\nAs with Spanish, many native languages have co-opted numerous loanwords from Chinese, in particular words that refer to cuisine, household objects, and Philippine kinship terminology.\\r\\nThe Japanese first came to the Philippines around the 11th century CE, the first country they emigrated to, as well as in waves from the 15th century, 17th century, late 19th century, 1900s, 1930s, and the 1940s.[22][23][24][25] There is a small Japanese community and a school for Japanese in Metro Manila due to the number of Japanese companies. Also there is a large community of Japanese and Japanese descendants in Laguna province, Baguio City, and in the Davao Region. Davao City is a home to a large population of Japanese descendants. Japanese laborers were hired by American companies like the National Fiber Company (NAFCO) in the first decades of the 20th century to work in abaca plantations. Japanese were known for their hard work and industry. During World War II, Japanese schools were present in Davao City.\\r\\nMalay is spoken as a lingua franca in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, from Zamboanga down to Tawi-Tawi among a minority of the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, and Yakan peoples. It is also spoken as a daily language by Malays and Indonesians who have settled, or do business in the Philippines. It is also spoken in southern Palawan to some extent. It is not spoken among the Maranao and Maguindanao people. Malaysia, Indonesia, and the southern Philippines are largely Islamic and the liturgical language of Islam is Arabic, but the vast majority of Muslims in the Philippines have little practical knowledge of Arabic beyond limited religious terminology.\\r\\nOld Malay and Indonesian cultures and civilizations in ancient Sumatra and Java influenced the history, lifestyles, and culture of Filipino peoples. The Malay language, along with Philippine languages belonging to the Malayo-Polynesian language family, has also had an immense influence on many if not most of the languages spoken in the Philippines. Roughly a third of all commonly used verbs and nouns used in the Philippines are of Old Malay origin. This is because Old Malay used to be the lingua franca throughout the archipelago, a good example of this is Magellan's translator Enrique using Malay to converse with the native Sugbuanon (Cebuano) during this time period.\\r\\nAn example of Old Malay and Javanese languages spoken in Philippine history can be seen in the language of the 10th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription.\\r\\nWhen the Spanish had first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, Old Malay was spoken among the aristocracy.\\r\\nIt is believed that Ferdinand Magellans Moluccan slave Enrique could converse with local leaders in Cebu island, confirming to Magellan his arrival in Southeast Asia.\\r\\nToday, Indonesian is taught as a foreign language in the Department of Linguistics and Asian Languages in the University of the Philippines. Also, the Indonesian School in Davao City teaches the language to preserve the culture of Indonesian immigrants there. The Indonesian Embassy in Manila also offers occasional classes for Filipinos and foreigners.\\r\\nSince 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.[26]\\r\\nIn an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro[27] said that the country's government should promote Indonesian or Malay, which are related to Filipino. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.\\r\\nSince pre-Spanish times, there have been small Indian communities in the Philippines. Indians tend to be able to speak Tagalog and the other native languages, and are often fluent in English. Among themselves, Sindhi and Punjabi are used. Urdu is spoken among the Pakistani community. Only few South Asians, such as Pakistani, as well as the recent newcomers like speakers of Tamil, Nepali and Marathi retain their own respective languages.[22][28][29][30][31][32]\\r\\nSpanish was introduced in the islands after 1565, when the Spanish conquistador Miguel L܇pez de Legazpi set sail from Mexico and founded the first Spanish settlement on Ceb~. However, it is rarely spoken today.[20]\\r\\nIn 1593, the first printing press in the Philippine islands was founded and it released the first (albeit polyglot) book, the Doctrina Christiana that same year. In the 17th century, Spanish religious orders founded the first universities in the Philippines, some of which are considered the oldest in Asia. During colonial rule through Mexico, Spanish was the language of education, trade, politics, and religion, and by the 19th century, became the colony's lingua franca although it was mainly used by the educated Filipinos.[33] In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced a system of public education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. In the 1890s, the Philippines had a prominent group of Spanish-speaking scholars called the Ilustrados, such as Jos Rizal. Some of these scholars participated in the Philippine Revolution and later in the struggle against American occupation. Both the Malolos Constitution and the Lupang Hinirang (national anthem) were written in Spanish.\\r\\nUnder U.S. rule, the English language began to be promoted instead of Spanish. The use of Spanish began to decline some years after Spain was forced to pass the islands to the United States as a result of the introduction of English into the public schools as a language of instruction.[10] The 1950 census stated that Filipinos who spoke Spanish as a first or second language made up only 6% of the population. In 1990, the census reported that the number had dwindled to just 2,500. A 2012 survey estimates that while around 3 million people can speak Spanish with varying degrees of competency, only around 439,000 people can speak the language at a native level.[34]\\r\\nSpanish briefly lost its status as an official language in the 1973 constitution but regained official status two months later when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155.[14] With the promulgation of the 1987 constitution, Spanish lost its official status and it was dropped as a college requirement during Coraz܇n Aquino's administration. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a third-language Spanish speaker, introduced legislation to re-establish the instruction of Spanish in 2009 in the state education system. Today, the language is still spoken by Filipino-Spanish mestizos and Spanish families who are mainly concentrated in Metro Manila, Iloilo and Cebu. It remains a required subject in some academic institutions, such as the University of Santo Toms in Manila and the University of San Carlos in Cebu. The 1987 Constitution mandates that Spanish (along with Arabic) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.\\r\\nMany historical documents, land titles, and works of literature are written in Spanish and are still not translated into Filipino languages, despite the fact that some such as land titles have legal value. Spanish, through colonization has contributed the largest number of loanwords and expressions in Tagalog, Cebuano, and other Philippine languages.[35]\\r\\nThere are several Spanish-based creole languages in the Philippines, collectively called Chavacano. These may be split into two major geographical groups:\\r\\nClick on a coloured area to see an article about English in that country or region","input":"How many languages are there in the philipines?"},{"output":"December 22, 1882","context":"Christmas lights (also known as fairy lights) are lights used for decoration in celebration of Christmas, often on display throughout the Christmas season including Advent and Christmastide. The custom goes back to when Christmas trees were decorated with candles, which symbolized Christ being the light of the world;[1] these were brought by Christians into their homes in early modern Germany.[2][3]\\r\\nChristmas trees displayed publicly and illuminated with electric lights became popular in the early 20th century. By the mid-20th century, it became customary to display strings of electric lights as along streets and on buildings; Christmas decorations detached from the Christmas tree itself. In the United States, it became popular to outline private homes with such Christmas lights in tract housing beginning in the 1960s. By the late 20th century, the custom had also been adopted in other nations, including outside the Western world, notably in Japan and Hong Kong. Throughout Christendom, Christmas lights continue to retain their symbolism of Jesus as the light of the world.[4][1]\\r\\nIn many countries, Christmas lights, as well as other Christmas decorations, are traditionally erected on or around the first day of Advent.[5][6] In the Western Christian world, the two traditional days when Christmas lights are removed are Twelfth Night and Candlemas, the latter of which ends the Christmas-Epiphany season in some denominations.[7] Leaving the decorations up beyond Candlemas is historically considered to be inauspicious.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Christmas tree was adopted in upper-class homes in 18th-century Germany, where it was occasionally decorated with candles, which at the time was a comparatively expensive light source. Candles for the tree were glued with melted wax to a tree branch or attached by pins. Around 1890, candleholders were first used for Christmas candles. Between 1902 and 1914, small lanterns and glass balls to hold the candles started to be used. Early electric Christmas lights were introduced with electrification, beginning in the 1880s.\\r\\nThe illuminated Christmas tree became established in the United Kingdom during Queen Victoria's reign, and through emigration spread to North America and Australia. In her journal for Christmas Eve 1832, the delighted 13-year-old princess wrote, \\"After dinner.. we then went into the drawing-room near the dining-room. There were two large round tables on which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All the presents being placed round the trees\\".[9] Until the availability of inexpensive electrical power in the early twentieth century, miniature candles were commonly (and in some cultures still are) used.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, electrically powered Christmas lights are generally known as fairy lights. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre, London was the first building in the world to be lit entirely by electricity.[10] Sir Joseph Swan, pioneer of the incandescent light bulb, supplied about 1,200 Swan incandescent lamps, and a year later, the Savoy owner Richard D'Oyly Carte equipped the principal fairies with miniature lighting supplied by the Swan United Electric Lamp Company, for the opening night of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe on 25 November 1882.[11] The term 'fairy lights', describing 'a small coloured light used in illuminations' had already entered English:[12] its usage for a string of electrically powered Christmas lights has been common in the UK ever since.[13]\\r\\nThe first known electrically illuminated Christmas tree was the creation of Edward H. Johnson, an associate of inventor Thomas Edison. While he was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of today's Con Edison electric utility, he had Christmas tree light bulbs especially made for him. He proudly displayed his Christmas tree, which was hand-wired with 80 red, white and blue electric incandescent light bulbs the size of walnuts, on December 22, 1882 at his home on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Local newspapers ignored the story, seeing it as a publicity stunt. However, it was published by a Detroit newspaper reporter, and Johnson has become widely regarded as the Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights. By 1900, businesses started stringing up Christmas lights behind their windows.[14] Christmas lights were too expensive for the average person; as such, electric Christmas lights did not become the majority replacement for candles until 1930.[15]\\r\\nIn 1895, U.S. President Grover Cleveland proudly sponsored the first electrically lit Christmas tree in the White House. It was a huge specimen, featuring more than a hundred multicolored lights. The first commercially produced Christmas tree lamps were manufactured in strings of multiples of eight sockets by the General Electric Co. of Harrison, New Jersey. Each socket took a miniature two-candela carbon-filament lamp.\\r\\nFrom that point on, electrically illuminated Christmas trees, but only indoors, grew with mounting enthusiasm in the United States and elsewhere. San Diego in 1904, Appleton, Wisconsin in 1909, and New York City in 1912 were the first recorded instances of the use of Christmas lights outside.[15] McAdenville, North Carolina claims to have been the first in 1956.[16] The Library of Congress credits the town for inventing \\"the tradition of decorating evergreen trees with Christmas lights dates back to 1956 when the McAdenville Men's Club conceived of the idea of decorating a few trees around the McAdenville Community Center.\\"[17] However, the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree has had \\"lights\\" since 1931, but did not have real electric lights until 1956.[18] Furthermore, Philadelphia's Christmas Light Show and Disney's Christmas Tree also began in 1956.[19][20] Though General Electric sponsored community lighting competitions during the 1920s, it would take until the mid-1950s for the use of such lights to be adopted by average households.\\r\\nOver a period of time,[clarification needed] strings of Christmas lights found their way into use in places other than Christmas trees. Soon, strings of lights adorned mantles and doorways inside homes, and ran along the rafters, roof lines, and porch railings of homes and businesses. In recent times, many city skyscrapers are decorated with long mostly-vertical strings of a common theme, and are activated simultaneously in Grand Illumination ceremonies.\\r\\nIn 1963, a boycott of Christmas lights was done in Greenville, North Carolina to protest the segregation that kept blacks from being employed by downtown businesses in Greenville, during the Christmas sales season. Known as the Black Christmas (boycott) or \\"Christmas Sacrifice\\", it was an effective way to protest the cultural and fiscal segregation in the town with 33% black population. Light decorations in the homes, on the Christmas trees, or outside the house were not shown, and only six houses in the black community broke the boycott that Christmas.[21]\\r\\nIn the mid-2000s, the video of the home of Carson Williams was widely distributed on the internet as a viral video. It garnered national attention in 2005 from The Today Show on NBC, Inside Edition and the CBS Evening News and was featured in a Miller television commercial.[22][23] Williams turned his hobby into a commercial venture, and was commissioned to scale up his vision to a scale of 250,000 lights at a Denver shopping center, as well as displays in parks and zoos.\\r\\nThe technology used in Christmas lighting displays is highly diverse, ranging from simple light strands, Christmas lights (a.k.a. Fairy lights), through to full blown animated tableaux, involving complex illuminated animatronics and statues.\\r\\nChristmas lights (also called twinkle lights, holiday lights, mini lights or fairy lights), that are strands of electric lights used to decorate homes, public/commercial buildings and Christmas trees during the Christmas season are amongst the most recognized form of Christmas lighting. Christmas lights come in a dazzling array of configurations and colors. The small \\"midget\\" bulbs commonly known as fairy lights are also called Italian lights in some parts of the U.S., such as Chicago.\\r\\nThe types of lamps used in Christmas lighting also vary considerably, reflecting the diversity of modern lighting technology in general. Common lamp types are incandescent light bulbs and now light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which are being increasingly encouraged as being more energy efficient. Less common are neon lamp sets. Fluorescent lamp sets were produced for a limited time by Sylvania in the mid-1940s.[24]\\r\\nChristmas lights using incandescent bulbs are somewhat notorious for being difficult to troubleshoot and repair. In the 1950s and 1960s, the series circuit connected light sets would go completely dark when a single bulb failed. So in the fairly recent past, the mini-lights have come with shunts to allow a set to continue to operate with a burned out bulb. However, if there are multiple bulb failures or a shunt is bad, the string can still fail. There are two basic ways to troubleshoot this: a one by one replacement with a known good bulb, or by using a test light to find out where the voltage gets interrupted. One example made specifically for Christmas lights is the LightKeeper Pro. For additional information, see the troubleshooting section of the Holiday lighting technology article.\\r\\nWhen Christmas light manufacturers first started using LEDs the colors seemed very dull and uninspiring. Even the white lights, which were typically single-chip LEDs, glowed with a faintly yellowish color that made them look cheap and unattractive.[25]\\r\\nDisplays of Christmas lights in public venues and on public buildings are a popular part of the annual celebration of Christmas, and may be set up by businesses or by local governments. The displays utilize Christmas lights in many ways, including decking towering Christmas trees in public squares, street trees and park trees, adorning lampposts and other such structures, decorating significant buildings such as town halls and department stores, and lighting up popular tourist attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Sydney Opera House. It is believed that the first outdoor public electric light Christmas Holiday display was organized by Fredrick Nash and the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce in Altadena, California, on Santa Rosa Avenue, called Christmas Tree Lane. Christmas Tree Lane in Altadena has been continuously lit except during WW2 since 1920. Annual displays in Regent Street and Oxford Street, London, date from 1954 and 1959 respectively.\\r\\nFrom the 1960s, beginning with tract housing in the U.S., it became increasingly common to completely outline the house (but particularly the eaves) with weatherproof Christmas lights. The Holiday Trail of Lights is a joint effort by cities in east Texas and northwest Louisiana that had its origins in the Festival of Lights and Christmas Festival in Natchitoches, started in 1927, making it one of the oldest light festivals in the United States. Fulton Street in Palo Alto, California, has the nickname \\"Christmas Tree Lane\\" due to the display of lighted Christmas trees on the sides of the street.[26]\\r\\nA familiar pastime during the holiday season is to drive or walk around neighborhoods in the evening to see the lights displayed on and around other homes. While some homes have no lights, others may have incredibly ornate displays which require weeks to construct. A rare few have even made it to the Extreme Christmas TV specials shown on HGTV, at least one requiring a generator and another requiring separate electrical service to supply the amount of electrical power required. In Australia and New Zealand, chains of Christmas lights were quickly adopted as an effective way to provide ambient lighting to verandas, where cold beer is often served in the long hot summer evenings. Since the late twentieth century, increasingly elaborate Christmas lights have been displayed, and driving around between 8 and 10 p.m. to look at the lights has become a popular form of family entertainment. In some areas Christmas lighting even becomes a fierce competition, with town councils offering awards for the best decorated house, in other areas it is seen as a co-operative effort, with residents priding themselves on their street or their neighbourhood. The town of Lobethal, South Australia, in the Adelaide Hills, is famed for its extensive Christmas lighting displays and many residents go to great effort to put on the best light display in the town. Residents from the nearby city of Adelaide often drive up to the town to view them.\\r\\nIn the United States, lights have been produced for many other holidays. These may be simple sets in typical holiday colors, or the type with plastic ornaments which the light socket fits into. Light sculptures are also produced in typical holiday icons.\\r\\nHalloween is the most popular, with miniature light strings having black-insulated wires and semi-opaque orange bulbs. Later sets had some transparent purple bulbs (a representation of black, similar to blacklight), a few even have transparent green, or a translucent or semi-opaque lime green (possibly representing slime as in Ghostbusters, or creatures like goblins or space aliens). Two types of icicle lights are sold at Halloween: all-orange, and a combination of purple and green known as \\"slime lights\\".\\r\\nEaster lights are often produced in pastels. These typically have white wire and connectors.\\r\\nRed, white, and blue lights are produced for Independence Day, as well as U.S. flag and other patriotic-themed ornaments. Net lights have been produced with the lights in a U.S. flag pattern. In 2006, some stores carried stakes with LEDs that light fiber-optics, looking similar to fireworks.\\r\\nThese above light strings are occasionally used on Christmas trees anyway, usually to add extra variety to the colors of the lights on the tree.\\r\\nVarious types of patio lighting with no holiday theme are also made for summertime. These are often clear white lights, but most are ornament sets, such as lanterns made of metal or bamboo, or plastic ornaments in the shape of barbecue condiments, flamingos and palm trees, or even various beers. Some are made of decorative wire or mesh, in abstract shapes such as dragonflies, often with glass \\"gems\\" or marbles. Light sculptures are also made in everything from wire-mesh frogs to artificial palm trees outlined in rope lights.\\r\\nIn Pakistan, fairy lights are often used to decorate in celebration of Eid ul-Fitr at Chaand Raat, which occurs at the end of Ramadan. In India on Diwali too, homes, shops and streets are decorated with strings of fairy lights.\\r\\nChristmas lighting does lead to some extensive recycling issues. Every year, more than 20 million pounds of discarded holiday lights are shipped to Shijiao, China (near Guangzhou), which has been referred to as \\"the world capital for recycling Christmas lights\\".[27] The region began importing discarded lights around 1990 in part because of its cheap labor and low environmental standards.[27] As late as 2009, many factories would simply burn the lights to melt the plastic and retrieve the copper wire, releasing toxic fumes into the local environment.[27] A safer technique was then developed that involved chopping the lights into a fine sand-like consistency, mixing it with water and vibrating the slurry on a table causing the different elements to separate out, similar to the process of panning for gold.[27] Everything is recycled: copper, brass, plastic and glass.\\r\\nMore and more cities in the U.S., for example, are setting up sensible alternatives and schemes to recycle Christmas lights, with towns organizing drop-off points for handing in old or discarded lights.[28][29]\\r\\nInstalling holiday lighting may also be a safety hazard when incorrectly connecting several strands of lights, repeatedly using the same extension cords, or using an unsafe ladder during the installation process.\\r\\nChristmas light sculptures, also called motifs, are used as Christmas decorations and for other holidays. Originally, these were large wireframe metalwork pieces made for public displays, such as for a municipal government to place on utility poles, and shopping centers to place on lampposts. Since the 1990s, these are also made in small plastic home versions that can be hung in a window, or on a door or wall. Framed motifs can be lit using mini lights or ropelight, and larger scale motifs and sculptures may use C7 bulbs.\\r\\nLight sculptures can be either flat (most common) or three-dimensional. Flat sculptures are the motifs, and are often on metal frames, but garland can also be attached to outdoor motifs. Indoor motifs often have a multicolored plastic backing sheet, sometimes holographic. 3D sculptures include deer or reindeer (even moose) in various positions, and with or without antlers, often with a motor to move the head up and down or side to side as if grazing. These and other 3D displays may be bare-frame, or be covered with garland, looped and woven transparent plastic cord or acrylic, or natural or goldtone-painted vines. Snowflakes are a popular design for municipal displays, so as not to be misconstrued as a government endorsement of religion, or so they can be left up all winter.\\r\\nSome places make huge displays of these during December, such as Callaway Gardens, Life University, and Lake Lanier Islands in the U.S. state of Georgia. In east Tennessee, the cities of Chattanooga, Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg have light sculptures up all winter. Gatlinburg also has custom ones for Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day, while Pigeon Forge puts flowers on its tall lampposts for spring, and for winter has a steamboat and the famous picture of U.S. Marines Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, in addition to the city's historic Old Mill.\\r\\nSome sculptures have microcontrollers that sequence circuits of lights, so that the object appears to be in motion. This is used for things such as snowflakes falling, Santa Claus waving, a peace dove flapping its wings, or train wheels rolling.\\r\\nChristmas lights on trees\\r\\nChamps-lyses\\r\\nChristmas in Dublin, CA\\r\\nPeter Larsen illuminated coffee pot\\r\\nChristmas market illumination\\r\\nClifton Mill Christmas in 2005\\r\\nLED light sculpture in G?nserndorf, Austria\\r\\nChristmas street illumination in Viborg\\r\\nHnfeld Adventskalender\\r\\nChristmas decoration in front of the church in Weissenbach an der Triesting\\r\\nChristmas Lights, Aarhus\\r\\nCity lights Christmastime\\r\\nChristmas Lights\\r\\nLighted trees and houses in Sch?ckingen\\r\\nThe clock tower of Kozani; a landmark of the city.\\r\\nMerry X-mas\\r\\nSantas sleigh\\r\\nEssex Christmas lighting ceremony\\r\\nGerman Christmas Market, Cardiff","input":"When were electric christmas tree lights first used?"},{"output":"early 2000s","context":"Millennials (also known as Generation Y) are the generational demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. Millennials are sometimes referred to as \\"echo boomers\\" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers. The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the \\"baby boom echo\\" was generally less pronounced than the postÿWorld War II baby boom.\\r\\nAlthough Millennial characteristics vary by region, depending on social and economic conditions, the generation is generally marked by an increased use and familiarity with communications, media, and digital technologies.[1] In most parts of the world, their upbringing was marked by an increase in a liberal approach to politics and economics; the effects of this environment are disputed. The Great Recession has had a major impact on this generation because it has caused historically high levels of unemployment among young people, and has led to speculation about possible long-term economic and social damage to this generation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthors William Strauss and Neil Howe are widely credited with naming the millennials.[2] They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering preschool, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000.[3] They wrote about the cohort in their books Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069 (1991)[4] and Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation (2000).[3]\\r\\nIn August 1993, an Advertising Age editorial coined the phrase Generation Y to describe those who were aged 11 or younger as well as the teenagers of the upcoming ten years who were defined as different from Generation X.[5][6] According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, Ad Age \\"threw in the towel by conceding that millennials is a better name than Gen Y\\",[2] and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at Ad Age said to NPR \\"the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them\\".[7] Millennials are sometimes called Echo Boomers,[8] due to their being the offspring of the baby boomers and due to the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid 1990s, mirroring that of their parents. In the United States, birth rates peaked in August 1990[9][10] and a 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued.[11][12] In his book The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom, author Elwood Carlson called this cohort the \\"New Boomers\\".[13]\\r\\nPsychologist Jean Twenge described millennials as \\"Generation Me\\" in her 2006 book Generation Me: Why Todays Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitledand More Miserable Than Ever Before, which was updated in 2014.[14][15] In 2013, Time magazine ran a cover story titled Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation.[16] Newsweek used the term Generation 9/11 to refer to young people who were between the ages of 10 and 20 years during the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001. The first reference to \\"Generation 9/11\\" was made in the cover story of the 12 November 2001 issue of Newsweek.[17] Alternative names for this group proposed include Generation We,[18] Global Generation, Generation Next[19] and the Net Generation.[20]\\r\\nChinese millennials are commonly called the 1980s and 1990s generations. At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by University of Southern California's US-China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials[21] Findings included millennials' marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism.[22]\\r\\nA minority of demographers and researchers start the generation in the mid-to-late 1970s, such as MetLife which uses birth dates ranging 1977ÿ1994,[23] and Nielsen Media Research which uses the earliest dates from 1977 and the latest dates 1995 or 1996.[24][25][26]\\r\\nThe majority of researchers and demographers start the generation in the early 1980s, with some ending the generation in the mid-1990s. Australia's McCrindle Research[27] uses 1980ÿ1994 as Generation Y birth years. A 2013 PricewaterhouseCoopers[28] report used 1980 to 1995. Gallup Inc.,[29][30][31] and MSW Research[32] use 1980ÿ1996. Ernst and Young uses 1981ÿ1996.[33]\\r\\nA 2018 report from Pew Research Center defines Millennials as born from 1981-1996, choosing these dates for \\"key political, economic and social factors\\", including September 11th terrorist attacks. This range makes Millennials 5-20 years old at the time of the attacks so \\"old enough to comprehend the historical significance\\". Pew indicated they'd use 1981-1996 for future publications but would remain open to date recalibration.[34]\\r\\nSome end the generation in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Goldman Sachs,[35] Resolution Foundation,[36][37] and a 2013 Time magazine cover story[38] all use 1980ÿ2000. SYZYGY, a digital service agency partially owned by WPP, uses 1981ÿ1998,[39][40] and the United States Census Bureau uses 1982ÿ2000.[41] The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary describes Millennials as those born roughly between the 1980s and 1990s.[42]\\r\\nDemographers William Straus and Neil Howe who are widely credited with coining the term, define Millennials as born between 1982ÿ2004.[2] However, Howe described the dividing line between millennials and the following Generation Z as \\"tentative\\", saying \\"you cant be sure where history will someday draw a cohort dividing line until a generation fully comes of age\\". He noted that the millennials' range beginning in 1982 would point to the next generation's window starting between 2000 and 2006.[43]\\r\\nIn his 2008 book The Lucky Few: Between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom, author Elwood Carlson defined this cohort as born between 1983ÿ2001 based on the upswing in births after 1983 and finishing with the \\"political and social challenges\\" that occurred after the September 11 terrorist acts.[13] In 2016, U.S Pirg described millennials as those born between 1983 and 2000.[44][45][46] On the American television program Survivor, for their 33rd season, subtitled Millennials vs. Gen X, the \\"Millennial tribe\\" consisted of individuals born between 1984 and 1997.[47]\\r\\nDue to birth-year overlap between definitions of Generation X and millennials, and the tentative nature of generations, some individuals born in the late 1970s and early 1980s see themselves as being \\"between\\" the two generations.[48][49][50][51] Names given to those born in the Generation X and Millennial cusp years include Xennials, Generation Catalano, and the Oregon Trail Generation.[51][52][53][54][55]\\r\\nAuthors William Strauss and Neil Howe believe that each generation has common characteristics that give it a specific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a cycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials will become more like the \\"civic-minded\\" G.I. Generation with a strong sense of community both local and global.[3] Strauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the Millennial cohort: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. Arthur E. Levine, author of When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today's College Student describes these generational images as \\"stereotypes\\".[56]\\r\\nStrauss and Howe's research has been influential, but it also has critics.[56] Psychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe's assertions are overly-deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence. Twenge, the author of the 2006 book Generation Me, considers millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls \\"Generation Me\\".[57] Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and tolerance, but also describes a sense of entitlement and narcissism, based on personality surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials compared to preceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties. She questions the predictions of Strauss and Howe that this generation will turn out civic-minded.[58][59] A 2016 study by SYZYGY a digital service agency, found millennials in the U.S. continue to exhibit elevated scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory as they age, finding millennials exhibited 16% more narcissism than older adults, with males scoring higher on average than females. The study examined two types of narcissism: grandiose narcissism, described as \\"the narcissism of extraverts, characterized by attention-seeking behavior, power and dominance\\", and vulnerable narcissism, described as \\"the narcissism of introverts, characterized by an acute sense of self-entitlement and defensiveness.\\"[39][40][60]\\r\\nThe University of Michigan's \\"Monitoring the Future\\" study of high school seniors (conducted continually since 1975) and the American Freshman survey, conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute of new college students since 1966, showed an increase in the proportion of students who consider wealth a very important attribute, from 45% for Baby Boomers (surveyed between 1967 and 1985) to 70% for Gen Xers, and 75% for millennials. The percentage who said it was important to keep abreast of political affairs fell, from 50% for Baby Boomers to 39% for Gen Xers, and 35% for millennials. The notion of \\"developing a meaningful philosophy of life\\" decreased the most across generations, from 73% for Boomers to 45% for millennials. The willingness to be involved in an environmental cleanup program dropped from 33% for Baby Boomers to 21% for millennials.[61] Millennials show a willingness to vote more than previous generations. With voter rates being just below 50% for the last four presidential cycles, they have already surpassed Gen Xers of the same age who were at just 36%.[62]\\r\\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who were at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored legalizing the use of marijuana.[63] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research regarding generational identity that said a majority did not like the \\"Millennial\\" label.[64]\\r\\nIn March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how \\"millennials in adulthood\\" are \\"detached from institutions and networked with friends.\\"[65][66] The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America's future, with 49% of millennials saying the countrys best years are ahead though they're the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.\\r\\nFred Bonner, a Samuel DeWitt Proctor Chair in Education at Rutgers University and author of Diverse Millennial Students in College: Implications for Faculty and Student Affairs, believes that much of the commentary on the Millennial Generation may be partially accurate, but overly general and that many of the traits they describe apply primarily to \\"white, affluent teenagers who accomplish great things as they grow up in the suburbs, who confront anxiety when applying to super-selective colleges, and who multitask with ease as their helicopter parents hover reassuringly above them.\\" During class discussions, Bonner listened to black and Hispanic students describe how some or all of the so-called core traits did not apply to them. They often said that the \\"special\\" trait, in particular, is unrecognizable. Other socio-economic groups often do not display the same attributes commonly attributed to millennials. \\"It's not that many diverse parents don't want to treat their kids as special,\\" he says, \\"but they often don't have the social and cultural capital, the time and resources, to do that.\\"[56]\\r\\nIn his book Fast Future, author David Burstein describes millennials' approach to social change as \\"pragmatic idealism\\" with a deep desire to make the world a better place, combined with an understanding that doing so requires building new institutions while working inside and outside existing institutions.[67]\\r\\nElza Venter, an educational psychologist and lecturer at Unisa, South Africa, in the Department of Psychology of Education, believes members of Generation Y are digital natives because they have grown up experiencing digital technology and have known it all their lives. Prensky [68] coined the concept digital natives because this generation are native speakers of the digital language of computers, video games and the internet. This generation spans 20 years and its older members use a combination of face-to-face communication and computer mediated communication, while its younger members use mainly electronic and digital technologies for interpersonal communication.[69]\\r\\nThere are vast, and conflicting, amounts of literature and empirical studies discussing the existence of generational differences as it pertains to the workplace.[70] The majority of research concludes millennials differ from both their generational cohort predecessors, and can be characterized by a preference for a flat corporate culture, an emphasis on work-life balance and social consciousness.\\r\\nAccording to authors from Florida International University, original research performed by Howe and Strauss as well as Yu & Miller suggest Baby Boomers resonate primarily with loyalty, work ethic, steady career path, and compensation when it comes to their professional lives.[71] Generation X on the other hand, started shifting preferences towards an improved work-life balance with a heightened focus on individual advancement, stability, and job satisfaction.[71] Meanwhile, millennials place an emphasis on producing meaningful work, finding a creative outlet, and have a preference for immediate feedback.[71] In the article \\"Challenges of the Work of the Future,\\" it is also stressed that millennials working at the knowledge-based jobs very often assume personal responsibility in order to make the most of what they do. As they are not satisfied with remaining for a long period of time at the same job, their career paths become more dynamic and less predictable.[72] Findings also suggest the introduction of social media has augmented collaborative skills and created a preference for a team-oriented environment.[71]\\r\\nIn the 2010 the Journal of Business and Psychology, contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials \\"expect close relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors\\" to be a main point of differentiation.[73] Multiple studies observe millennials associating job satisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to supervisors, and more immediate feedback.[73] Hershatter and Epstein, researchers from Emory University, argue a lot of these traits can be linked to millennials entering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created a much more structured educational system.[74] Some argue in the wake of these reforms, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, millennials have increasingly sought the aid of mentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work environment.[74]\\r\\nHershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance. Studies show nearly one-third of students' top priority is to \\"balance personal and professional life\\".[74] The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out of 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values.[74] Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers' work-centric attitude.[73]\\r\\nData also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service sector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the Journal of Business and Psychology stating heightened participation in the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps as a result of millennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs.[73] Volunteer activity between 2007 and 2008 show the Millennial age group experienced almost three-times the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a survey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their upbringing.[73] This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public service.[73]\\r\\nThe 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate social responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universums 2011 survey, depicting a preference to work for companies engaged in the betterment of society.[75] Millennials' shift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a 60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial institutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the generation's least liked brands.[75]\\r\\nIn 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials \\"Trophy Kids,\\"[76] a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments.[76] Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace.[77] Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations.[78] Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggests there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being \\"more practical\\" and \\"more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime\\" which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007-2008.[79]\\r\\nThere is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between millennials and Generation X. Researchers from the University of Missouri and The University of Tennessee conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if such a difference does in fact exist.[80] The study looked at 1,860 participants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), a survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics, across a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008.[80] The results of the findings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between the two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with relatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor, the Baby Boomers.[80]\\r\\nThat said, some research fails to find convincing differences. A meta study conducted by researchers from The George Washington University and The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism.[81] The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals.[81] Newer research shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generationsnamely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong workÿlife balance in their jobs[82] and have similar career aspirations to other generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as much as their older colleagues.[83]\\r\\nSurveys of political attitudes among millennials in the United Kingdom have suggested increasingly social liberal views, as well as higher overall support for classical liberal economic policies than preceding generations. They are more likely to support same-sex marriage and the legalization of drugs.[84] The Economist parallels this with millennials in the United States, whose attitudes are more supportive of social liberal policies and same-sex marriage relative to other demographics.[84] They are also more likely to oppose animal testing for medical purposes than older generations.[85] Pew Research described Millennials as \\"the force of the youth vote\\" and as part of the political conversation which helped elect the first U.S. black president, describing Millennials as between 12 and 27 during the 2008 U.S Presidential election.[34]\\r\\nBernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist and democratic candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, was the most popular candidate among Millennial voters in the primary phase, having garnered more votes from people under 30 in 21 states than the major parties' candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, did combined.[86] In April 2016, The Washington Post viewed him as changing the way millennials viewed politics, saying, \\"He's not moving a party to the left. He's moving a generation to the left.\\"[87][88] Bernie Sanders referred to millennials as \\"the least prejudiced generation in the history of the United States\\".[89] A 2014 poll for the libertarian Reason magazine suggested that American millennials were social liberals and fiscal centrists, more often than their global peers. The magazine predicted that millennials would become more conservative on fiscal issues once they started paying taxes.[90]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the majority of millennials opposed the British withdrawal from the European Union. Blaming Baby boomers, who largely supported the referendum, one commenter said: \\"The younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied.\\"[91][92][93][94] The Washington Post phrased this as \\"we let you steal our future\\", reporting high voter turnout among those over 55 years of age and low voter turnout among those under 34 years of age.[95][96][97][98][99]\\r\\nIn some countries, including the U.S. and the UK, millennials are more likely to support political correctness than members of older generations.[100] In 2015, a Pew Research study found 40% of millennials in the United States supported government restriction of public speech offensive to minority groups. Support for restricting offensive speech was lower among older generations, with 27% of Gen Xers, 24% of Baby Boomers, and only 12% of the Silent Generation supporting such restrictions. Pew Research noted similar age related trends in the United Kingdom, but not in Germany and Spain, where millennials were less supportive of restricting offensive speech than older generations. In France, Italy and Poland no significant age differences were observed.[101] In the U.S. and UK, millennials have brought changes to higher education via drawing attention to microaggressions and advocating for implementation of safe spaces and trigger warnings in the university setting. Critics of such changes have raised concerns regarding their impact on free speech, asserting these changes can promote censorship, while proponents have described these changes as promoting inclusiveness.[100][102][103]\\r\\nMillennial population size varies, depending on the definition used. William Strauss and Neil Howe projected in their 1991 book Generations that the U.S. Millennial population would be 76 million.[104] Later,[when?] using dates ranging from 1982 to 2004, Neil Howe revised the number to over 95 million people (in the U.S.).[citation needed] In a 2012 Time magazine article, it was estimated that there were approximately 80 million U.S. millennials.[105] The United States Census Bureau, using birth dates ranging from 1982 to 2000, stated the estimated number of U.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people.[106]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Pew Research Center found that millennials surpassed Baby Boomers to become the largest living generation in the United States. By analyzing 2015 U.S Census data they found there were 75.4 million millennials, based on Pew's definition of the generation which ranges from 1981 to 1997, compared to 74.9 million Baby Boomers.[107][108]However with their revised end date of 1996, millennials are expected to surpass boomers in size in 2019.[109]\\r\\nEconomic prospects for some millennials have declined largely due to the Great Recession in the late 2000s.[110][111][112] Several governments have instituted major youth employment schemes out of fear of social unrest due to the dramatically increased rates of youth unemployment.[113] In Europe, youth unemployment levels were very high (56% in Spain,[114] 44% in Italy,[115] 35% in the Baltic states, 19.1% in Britain[116] and more than 20% in many more countries). In 2009, leading commentators began to worry about the long-term social and economic effects of the unemployment.[117] Unemployment levels in other areas of the world were also high, with the youth unemployment rate in the U.S. reaching a record 19.1% in July 2010 since the statistic started being gathered in 1948.[118] In Canada, unemployment among youths in July 2009 was 15.9%, the highest it had been in 11 years.[119] Underemployment is also a major factor. In the U.S. the economic difficulties have led to dramatic increases in youth poverty, unemployment, and the numbers of young people living with their parents.[120] In April 2012, it was reported that half of all new college graduates in the US were still either unemployed or underemployed.[121] It has been argued that this unemployment rate and poor economic situation has given millennials a rallying call with the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement.[122] However, according to Christine Kelly, Occupy is not a youth movement and has participants that vary from the very young to very old.[123]\\r\\nA variety of names have emerged in various European countries hard hit following the financial crisis of 2007ÿ2008 to designate young people with limited employment and career prospects.[124] These groups can be considered to be more or less synonymous with millennials, or at least major sub-groups in those countries. The Generation of ?700 is a term popularized by the Greek mass media and refers to educated Greek twixters of urban centers who generally fail to establish a career. In Greece, young adults are being \\"excluded from the labor market\\" and some \\"leave their country of origin to look for better options\\". They're being \\"marginalized and face uncertain working conditions\\" in jobs that are unrelated to their educational background, and receive the minimum allowable base salary of ?700 per month. This generation evolved in circumstances leading to the Greek debt crisis and some participated in the 2010ÿ2011 Greek protests.[125] In Spain, they're referred to as the mileurista (for ?1,000 per month),[126] in France \\"The Precarious Generation,[127]\\" and as in Spain, Italy also has the \\"milleurista\\"; generation of 1,000 euros (per month).[124]\\r\\nIn 2015, millennials in New York City were reported as earning 20% less than the generation before them, as a result of entering the workforce during the great recession. Despite higher college attendance rates than Generation X, many were stuck in low-paid jobs, with the percentage of degree-educated young adults working in low-wage industries rising from 23% to 33% between 2000 and 2014.[128] In 2016, research from the Resolution Foundation found millennials in the UK earned S8,000 less in their 20s than Generation X, describing millennials as \\"on course to become the first generation to earn less than the one before\\".[129][130]\\r\\nGeneration Flux is a neologism and psychographic (not demographic) designation coined by Fast Company for American employees who need to make several changes in career throughout their working lives due to the chaotic nature of the job market following the Great Recession. Societal change has been accelerated by the use of social media, smartphones, mobile computing, and other new technologies.[131] Those in \\"Generation Flux\\" have birth-years in the ranges of both Generation X and millennials. \\"Generation Sell\\" was used by author William Deresiewicz to describe millennials' interest in small businesses.[132]\\r\\nMillennials are expected to make up approximately half of the U.S. workforce by 2020. Millennials are the most highly educated and culturally diverse group of all generations, and have been regarded as hard to please when it comes to employers.[133] To address these new challenges, many large firms are currently studying the social and behavioral patterns of millennials and are trying to devise programs that decrease intergenerational estrangement, and increase relationships of reciprocal understanding between older employees and millennials. The UK's Institute of Leadership & Management researched the gap in understanding between Millennial recruits and their managers in collaboration with Ashridge Business School.[134] The findings included high expectations for advancement, salary and for a coaching relationship with their manager, and suggested that organizations will need to adapt to accommodate and make the best use of millennials. In an example of a company trying to do just this, Goldman Sachs conducted training programs that used actors to portray millennials who assertively sought more feedback, responsibility, and involvement in decision making. After the performance, employees discussed and debated the generational differences they saw played out.[76]\\r\\nMillennials have benefited the least from the economic recovery following the Great Recession, as average incomes for this generation have fallen at twice the general adult population's total drop and are likely to be on a path toward lower incomes for at least another decade. A Bloomberg L.P. article wrote that \\"Three and a half years after the worst recession since the Great Depression, the earnings and employment gap between those in the under-35 population and their parents and grandparents threatens to unravel the American dream of each generation doing better than the last. The nation's younger workers have benefited least from an economic recovery that has been the most uneven in recent history.\\"[135]\\r\\nIn 2014, millennials were entering an increasingly multi-generational workplace.[136] Even though research has shown that millennials are joining the workforce during a tough economic time they still have remained optimistic, as shown when about nine out of ten millennials surveyed by the Pew Research Center said that they currently have enough money or that they will eventually reach their long-term financial goals.[137]\\r\\nAmerican sociologist Kathleen Shaputis labeled millennials as the Boomerang Generation or Peter Pan generation, because of the members' perceived tendency for delaying some rites of passage into adulthood for longer periods than most generations before them. These labels were also a reference to a trend toward members living with their parents for longer periods than previous generations.[138] Kimberly Palmer regards the high cost of housing and higher education, and the relative affluence of older generations, as among the factors driving the trend.[139] Questions regarding a clear definition of what it means to be an adult also impacts a debate about delayed transitions into adulthood and the emergence of a new life stage, Emerging Adulthood. A 2012 study by professors at Brigham Young University found that college students were more likely to define \\"adult\\" based on certain personal abilities and characteristics rather than more traditional \\"rite of passage\\" events.[140] Larry Nelson noted that \\"In prior generations, you get married and you start a career and you do that immediately. What young people today are seeing is that approach has led to divorces, to people unhappy with their careers  The majority want to get married [] they just want to do it right the first time, the same thing with their careers.\\"[140] Their expectations have had a dampening effect on millennials' rate of marriage.\\r\\nA 2013 joint study by sociologists at the University of Virginia and Harvard University found that the decline and disappearance of stable full-time jobs with health insurance and pensions for people who lack a college degree has had profound effects on working-class Americans, who now are less likely to marry and have children within marriage than those with college degrees.[141] Data from a 2014 study of U.S. millennials revealed over 56% of this cohort considers themselves as part of the working class, with only approximately 35% considering themselves as part of the middle class; this class identity is the lowest polling of any generation.[142]\\r\\nResearch by the Urban Institute conducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will have a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that by age 40, 30.7% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice the share of their single Gen X counterparts. The data showed similar trends for males.[143][144] A 2016 study from Pew Research showed millennials delay some activities considered rites of passage of adulthood with data showing young adults aged 18ÿ34 were more likely to live with parents than with a relationship partner, an unprecedented occurrence since data collection began in 1880. Data also showed a significant increase in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the previous demographic cohort, Generation X, with 23% of young adults aged 18ÿ34 living with parents in 2000, rising to 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18ÿ34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 31.6% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior economist for Pew Research said of millennials, \\"they're the group much more likely to live with their parents.\\" furthering \\"they're concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children\\".[145][146]\\r\\nAccording to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at Wharton School of Business, more than half of Millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the Wharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012. In 1992, 78% of women planned to eventually have children dropping to 42% in 2012. The results were similar for male students. The research revealed among both genders the proportion of undergraduates who reported they eventually planned to have children had dropped in half over the course of a generation.[147][148][149]\\r\\nIn the U.S., millennials are the least likely to be religious when compared to older generations.[150] There is a trend towards irreligion that has been increasing since the 1940s.[151] 29 percent of Americans born between 1983 and 1994 are irreligious, as opposed to 21 percent born between 1963 and 1981, 15 percent born between 1948 and 1962 and only 7 percent born before 1948.[152] A 2005 study looked at 1,385 people aged 18 to 25 and found that more than half of those in the study said that they pray regularly before a meal. One-third said that they discussed religion with friends, attended religious services, and read religious material weekly. Twenty-three percent of those studied did not identify themselves as religious practitioners.[153] A Pew Research Center study on millennials shows that of those between 18ÿ29 years old, only 3% of these emerging adults self-identified as \\"atheists\\" and only 4% self-identified as \\"agnostics\\". Overall, 25% of millennials are \\"Nones\\" and 75% are religiously affiliated.[154]\\r\\nOver half of millennials polled in the United Kingdom in 2013 said they had \\"no religion nor attended a place of worship\\", other than for a wedding or a funeral. 25% said they \\"believe in a God\\", while 19% believed in a \\"spiritual greater power\\" and 38% said they did not believe in God nor any other \\"greater spiritual power\\". The poll also found 41% thought religion was \\"the cause of evil\\" in the world more often than good.[155] The British Social Attitudes Survey found that 71% of British 18-24 year-olds were not religious, with just 3% affiliated to the once-dominant Church of England.[156]\\r\\nIn their 2007 book, authors Junco and Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of college students. They found that Next Generation college students, born between 1983ÿ1992, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations. In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a computer, 94% owned a mobile phone, and 56% owned an MP3 player. They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics. Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used instant messaging, 92% of those reported multitasking while instant messaging, 40% of them used television to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the Internet as their primary news source.[157][158] Older millennials came of age prior to widespread usage and availability of smartphones, defined as those born 1988 and earlier, in contrast to younger millennials, those born in 1989 and later, who were exposed to this technology in their teen years.[79]\\r\\nGen Xers and millennials were the first to grow up with computers in their homes. In a 1999 speech at the New York Institute of Technology, Microsoft Chairman and CEO Bill Gates encouraged America's teachers to use technology to serve the needs of the first generation of kids to grow up with the Internet.[159] Some millennials enjoy having hundreds of channels from cable TV. However, some other millennials do not even have a TV, so they watch media over the Internet using smartphones and tablets.[160] One of the most popular forms of media use by millennials is social networking. In 2010, research was published in the Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research which claimed that students who used social media and decided to quit showed the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict who quit their stimulant.[161] Marc Prensky coined the term \\"digital native\\" to describe \\"K through college\\" students in 2001, explaining they \\"represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology.\\"[162] Millennials are identified as \\"digital natives\\" by the Pew Research Center which conducted a survey titled Millennials in Adulthood.[66]\\r\\nMillennials use social networking sites, such as Facebook, to create a different sense of belonging, make acquaintances, and to remain connected with friends.[163] In the Frontline episode \\"Generation Like\\" there is discussion about millennials, their dependence on technology, and the ways the social media sphere is commoditized.[164]\\r\\nStrauss & Howe's book titled Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation describes the Millennial generation as \\"civic-minded\\", rejecting the attitudes of the Baby Boomers and Generation X.[165] Since the 2000 U.S. Census, which allowed people to select more than one racial group, millennials in abundance have asserted the ideal that all their heritages should be respected, counted, and acknowledged.[166][167] Millennials are the children of Baby Boomers or Generation X, while some older members may have parents from the Silent Generation. A 2013 poll in the United Kingdom found that Generation Y was more \\"open-minded than their parents on controversial topics\\".[155][168] Of those surveyed, nearly 75% supported same-sex marriage.\\r\\nA 2013 Pew Research Poll found that 84% of millennials, born since 1980, who were at that time between the ages of 18 and 32, favored legalizing the use of marijuana.[63] In 2015, the Pew Research Center also conducted research regarding generational identity.[64] It was discovered that millennials are less likely to strongly identify with the generational term when compared to Generation X or to the Baby Boomers, with only 40% of those born between 1981 and 1997 identifying as part of the Millennial Generation. Among older millennials, those born 1981ÿ1988, Pew Research found 43% personally identified as members of the older demographic cohort, Generation X, while only 35% identified as millennials. Among younger millennials (born 1989ÿ1997), generational identity was not much stronger, with only 45% personally identifying as millennials. It was also found that millennials chose most often to define itself with more negative terms such as self-absorbed, wasteful or greedy. In this 2015 report, Pew defined millennials with birth years ranging from 1981 onwards.[64]\\r\\nMillennials came of age in a time where the entertainment industry began to be affected by the Internet.[169][170][171] In addition to millennials being the most ethnically and racially diverse compared to the generations older than they are, they are also on pace to be the most formally educated. As of 2008[update], 39.6% of millennials between the ages of 18 and 24 were enrolled in college, which was an American record. Along with being educated, millennials also tend to upbeat. As stated above in the economic prospects section, about 9 out of 10 millennials feel as though they have enough money or that they will reach their long-term financial goals, even during the tough economic times, and they are more optimistic about the future of the U.S. Additionally, millennials are also more open to change than older generations. According to the Pew Research Center that did a survey in 2008, millennials are the most likely of any generation to self-identify as liberals and are also more supportive of progressive domestic social agenda than older generations. Finally, millennials are less overtly religious than the older generations. About one in four millennials are unaffiliated with any religion, a considerably higher ratio than that of older generations when they were the ages of millennials.[137]","input":"When is the cutoff for being a millennial?"},{"output":"to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland","context":"The hypothalamus is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.[1]  In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon.  All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is the size of an almond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst,[2] fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.[citation needed] The hypothalamus derives its name from Greek ??, \\"under\\" and Ĳ?ϫ?, thalamus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is a brain structure made up of distinct nuclei as well as less anatomically distinct areas. It is found in all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus produce neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary.[3] Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells, neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamic nuclei include the following:[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also: ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, periventricular nucleus.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cross section of the monkey hypothalamus displays 2 of the major hypothalamic nuclei on either side of the fluid-filled 3rd ventricle.\\r\\n\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei\\r\\n\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei on one side of the hypothalamus, shown in a 3-D computer reconstruction[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost nerve fibres within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females.[11] Some differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area,[11] in which the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons. The importance of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior. If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes. Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic;[12] this is why in many species, adult males are visibly distinguishable from females.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.\\r\\n\\r\\nEstrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions.  Estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site. Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter region of the gene.  In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMale and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5ÿ6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor.[16] Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hypothalamicÿadenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones, also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones.[18]\\r\\nThese hypophysiotropic hormones are stimulated by parvocellular neurosecretory cells located in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus.  After their release into the capillaries of the third ventricle, the hypophysiotropic hormones travel through what is known as the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation.  Once they reach their destination in the anterior pituitary, these hormones bind to specific receptors located on the surface of pituitary cells.  Depending on which cells are activated through this binding, the pituitary will either begin secreting or stop secreting hormones into the rest of the bloodstream.  (Bear, Mark F. \\"Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary.\\" Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer, 2016. 528. Print.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOther hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, and neurotensin.[20][21][22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis, neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary, which is actually a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviours. The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which generated externally and some internally. Delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsive to:\\r\\n\\r\\nOlfactory stimuli are important for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species. For instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after coitus then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during coitus, a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory memory' of her partner that persists for several days.\\r\\nPheromonal cues aid synchronization of oestrus in many species; in women, synchronized menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues, although the role of pheromones in humans is disputed.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus, and to do so they must pass through the bloodÿbrain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective bloodÿbrain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules.  Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not clear. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFindings have suggested that thyroid hormone (T4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body.[26]  It sets a desired body temperature, and stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature.  All fevers result from a raised setting in the hypothalamus; elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia.[26]  Rarely, direct damage to the hypothalamus, such as from a stroke, will cause a fever; this is sometimes called a hypothalamic fever. However, it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body temperatures.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids ÿ (the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, released in response to ACTH). It also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons (in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus), which are important for appetite. The preoptic area contains thermosensitive neurons; these are important for TRH secretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation in the presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.\\r\\n\\r\\nCardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, including for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or promote feeding, by signalling the release of leptin or gastrin, respectively. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition hypothalamic function is responsive toand regulated bylevels of all three classical monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are different hypotheses related to this regulation:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors.[29] Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the \\"behavioral control column\\" is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nExposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat.[31] In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl).[32] The premammillary nucleus has an important role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight.[32][33] The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores.[33] The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.[34][35]\\r\\nIn addition, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior.[32] Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus, and the ventral premammilary nucleus.[36] Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part.[36] Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the \\"on-the-back\\" posture.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to D. F. Swaab, writing in a July 2008 paper, \\"Neurobiological research related to sexual orientation in humans is only just gathering momentum, but the evidence already shows that humans have a vast array of brain differences, not only in relation to gender, but also in relation to sexual orientation.\\"[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwaab first reported on the relationship between sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's \\"clock\\", the  suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In 1990, Swaab and Hofman[38] reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al.[39] linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women. \\r\\nHowever, a study in 1992 has shown that the sexually dimorph nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted D?rner hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female hypothalamus\\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \\"male brain from originally female brain\\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.[40][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 and 2006, two studies by Berglund, Lindstr?m, and Savic[42][43] used positron emission tomography (PET) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors, the scent of testosterone found in male sweat, and the scent of estrogen found in female urine. These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four groups did not respond to the common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman brain left dissected midsagittal view\\r\\n\\r\\nLocation of the hypothalamus","input":"What is the basic function of the hypothalamus?"},{"output":"Ireland","context":"The English overseas possessions, also known as the English colonial empire, comprised a variety of overseas territories that were colonized, conquered, or otherwise acquired by the former Kingdom of England during the centuries before the Acts of Union of 1707 between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland created the Kingdom of Great Britain. The many English possessions then became the foundation of the British Empire and its fast-growing naval and mercantile power, which until then had yet to overtake those of the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of Portugal, and the Kingdom of Spain.\\r\\nThe first English overseas settlements were established in Ireland, quickly followed by others in North America, Bermuda, and the West Indies, and by trading posts called \\"factories\\" in the East Indies, such as Bantam, and in the Indian subcontinent, beginning with Surat. In 1639, a series of English fortresses on the Indian coast was initiated with Fort St George. In 1661, the marriage of King Charles II to Catherine of Braganza brought him as part of her dowry new possessions which until then had been Portuguese, including Tangier in North Africa and Bombay in India.\\r\\nIn North America, Newfoundland and Virginia were the first centres of English colonization. As the 17th century wore on, Maine, Plymouth, New Hampshire, Salem, Massachusetts Bay, New Scotland, Connecticut, New Haven, Maryland, and Rhode Island and Providence were settled. In 1664, New Netherland and New Sweden were taken from the Dutch, becoming New York, New Jersey, and parts of Delaware and Pennsylvania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of England is generally dated from the rule of ?thelstan from 927.[1] During the rule of the House of Knytlinga, from 1013 to 1014 and 1016 to 1042, England was part of a personal union that included domains in Scandinavia. In 1066, William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy, conquered England, making the Duchy a Crown land of the English throne. Through the remainder of the Middle Ages the kings of England held extensive territories in France, based on their history in this Duchy. Under the Angevin Empire, England formed part of a collection of lands in the British Isles and France held by the Plantagenet dynasty. The collapse of this dynasty led to the Hundred Years' War between England and France. At the outset of the war the Kings of England ruled almost all of France, but by the end of it in 1453 only the Pale of Calais remained to them.[2] Calais was eventually lost to the French in 1558. The Channel Islands, as the remnants of the Duchy of Normandy, retain their link to the Crown to the present day,\\r\\nOther early English expansion occurred within the British Isles. As early as 1169, the Norman invasion of Ireland began to establish English possessions in Ireland, with thousands of English and Welsh settlers arriving in Ireland.[3] As a result of this the Lordship of Ireland was held for centuries by the English monarch, although it was not until the early 17th century that the Plantation of Ulster began.[4][page?needed] English control of Ireland fluctuated for centuries until Ireland was incorporated into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.\\r\\nThe voyages of Christopher Columbus began in 1492, and he sighted land in the West Indies on 12 October that year. In 1496, excited by the successes in overseas exploration of the Portuguese and the Spanish, King Henry VII of England commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to find a route from the Atlantic to the Spice Islands of Asia, subsequently known as the search for the North West Passage. Cabot sailed in 1497, successfully making landfall on the coast of Newfoundland. There, he believed he had reached Asia and made no attempt to found a permanent colony.[5] He led another voyage to the Americas the following year, but nothing was heard of him or his ships again.[6]\\r\\nThe Reformation had made enemies of England and Spain, and in 1562 Elizabeth sanctioned the privateers Hawkins and Drake to attack Spanish ships off the coast of West Africa.[7] Later, as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth approved further raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and against shipping returning to Europe with treasure from the New World.[8] Meanwhile, the influential writers Richard Hakluyt and John Dee were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own overseas empire. Spain was well established in the Americas, while Portugal had built up a network of trading posts and fortresses on the coasts of Africa, Brazil, and China, and the French had already begun to settle the Saint Lawrence River, which later became New France.[9]\\r\\nThe first serious attempts to establish English colonies overseas were made in the last quarter of the 16th century, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.[10] The 1580s saw the first attempt at permanent English settlements in North America, a generation before the Plantation of Ulster. Soon there was an explosion of English colonial activity, driven by men seeking new land, by the pursuit of trade, and by the search for religious freedom. In the 17th century, the destination of most English people making a new life overseas was in the West Indies rather than in North America.\\r\\nFinanced by the Muscovy Company, Martin Frobisher set sail on 7 June 1576, from Blackwall, London, seeking the North West Passage. In August 1576 he landed at Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and this was marked by the first Church of England service recorded on North American soil. Frobisher returned to Frobisher Bay in 1577, solemnly taking possession of the south side of it in Queen Elizabeth's name. In a third voyage, in 1578, he reached the shores of Greenland and also made an unsuccessful attempt at founding a settlement in Frobisher Bay.[11][12] While on the coast of Greenland, he also claimed that for England.[13]\\r\\nAt the same time, between 1577 and 1580, Sir Francis Drake was circumnavigating the globe. He claimed Elizabeth Island off Cape Horn for his queen, and on 24 August 1578 claimed another Elizabeth Island, in the Straits of Magellan.[14] In 1579, he landed on the north coast of California, claiming the area for Elizabeth as \\"New Albion\\".[15] However, these claims were not followed up by settlements.[16]\\r\\nIn 1578, while Drake was away on his circumnavigation, Queen Elizabeth granted a patent for overseas exploration to his half-brother Humphrey Gilbert, and that year Gilbert sailed for the West Indies to engage in piracy and to establish a colony in North America. However, the expedition was abandoned before the Atlantic had been crossed. In 1583, Gilbert sailed to Newfoundland, where in a formal ceremony he took possession of the harbour of St John's together with all land within two hundred leagues to the north and south of it, although he left no settlers behind him. He did not survive the return journey to England.[17][18]\\r\\nOn 25 March 1584, Queen Elizabeth I (the \\"Virgin Queen\\") granted Sir Walter Raleigh a charter for the colonization of an area of North America which was to be called, in her honour, Virginia. This charter specified that Raleigh had seven years in which to establish a settlement, or else lose his right to do so. Raleigh and Elizabeth intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World and a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain. Raleigh himself never visited North America, although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to the Orinoco River basin in South America in search of the golden city of El Dorado. Instead, he sent others to found the Roanoke Colony, later known as the \\"Lost Colony\\".[19]\\r\\nOn 31 December 1600, Elizabeth gave a charter to the East India Company, under the name \\"The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies\\".[20] The Company soon established its first trading post in the East Indies, at Bantam on the island of Java, and others, beginning with Surat, on the coasts of what is now India and Bangladesh.\\r\\nMost of the new English colonies established in North America and the West Indies, whether successfully or otherwise, were proprietary colonies with Proprietors, appointed to found and govern settlements under mercantile charters granted to joint stock companies. Early examples of these are the Virginia Company, which created the first successful English overseas settlements at Jamestown in 1607 and Bermuda, unofficially in 1609 and officially in 1612, its spin-off, the Somers Isles Company, to which Bermuda (also known as the Somers Isles) was transferred in 1615, and the Newfoundland Company which settled Cuper's Cove near St John's, Newfoundland in 1610. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts Bay were also charter colonies.\\r\\nBermuda, today the oldest-remaining British Overseas Territory, was settled and claimed by England as a result of the shipwreck there in 1609 of the Virginia Company's flagship Sea Venture. The town of St George's, founded in Bermuda in 1612, remains the oldest continuously-inhabited English settlement in the New World. Some historians state that with its formation predating the conversion of \\"James Fort\\" into \\"Jamestown\\" in 1619, St George's was actually the first successful town the English established in the New World. Bermuda and Bermudians have played important, sometimes pivotal, roles in the shaping of the English and British trans-Atlantic empires. These include roles in maritime commerce, settlement of the continent and of the West Indies, and the projection of naval power via the colony's privateers, among others.[21][22]\\r\\nBetween 1640 and 1660, the West Indies were the destination of more than two-thirds of English emigrants to the New World. By 1650, there were 44,000 English people in the Caribbean, compared to 12,000 on the Chesapeake and 23,000 in New England.[23] The most substantial English settlement in that period was at Barbados.\\r\\nIn 1660, King Charles II established the Royal African Company, essentially a trading company dealing in slaves, led by his brother James, Duke of York. In 1661, Charles's marriage to the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza brought him the ports of Tangier in Africa and Bombay in India as part of her dowry. Tangier proved very expensive to hold and was abandoned in 1684.[24]\\r\\nAfter the Dutch surrender of Fort Amsterdam to English control in 1664, England took over the Dutch colony of New Netherland, including New Amsterdam. Formalized in 1667, this contributed to the Second AngloÿDutch War. In 1664, New Netherland was renamed the Province of New York. At the same time, the English also came to control the former New Sweden, in the present-day US state of Delaware, which had also been a Dutch possession and later became part of Pennsylvania. In 1673, the Dutch regained New Netherland, but they gave it up again under the Treaty of Westminster of 1674.\\r\\nIn 1621, following a downturn in overseas trade which had created financial problems for the Exchequer, King James instructed his Privy Council to establish an ad hoc committee of inquiry to look into the causes of the decline. This was called The Lords of the Committee of the Privy Council appointed for the consideration of all matters relating to Trade and Foreign Plantations. Intended to be a temporary creation, the committee, later called a 'Council', became the origin of the Board of Trade which has had an almost continuous existence since 1621. The Committee quickly took a hand in promoting the more profitable enterprises of the English possessions, and in particular the production of tobacco and sugar.[25]\\r\\nCapture of Gibraltar. In 1704 Gibraltar was captured for England by an Anglo-Dutch fleet, becoming the country's first European overseas possession since the sale of Dunkirk to France in 1662. The Naval operation was commanded by George Rooke. Gibraltar later became a strategic naval base for the Royal Navy and was officially ceded to Great Britain in 1713.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Union of 1706, which with effect from 1707 combined England and Scotland into a new sovereign state called Great Britain, provided for the subjects of the new state to \\"have full freedom and intercourse of trade and navigation to and from any port or place within the said united kingdom and the Dominions and Plantations thereunto belonging\\". While the Treaty of Union also provided for the winding up of the Scottish African and Indian Company, it made no such provision for the English companies or colonies. In effect, with the Union they became British colonies.[41]","input":"What was the name of england's first overseas colony?"},{"output":"Dallas","context":"The State Fair of Texas is an annual state fair held in Dallas at historic Fair Park. The fair has taken place every year since 1886 except for varying periods during World War I and World War II.[1] It usually begins the last Friday in September and ends 24 days later. While the State Fair of Texas considers quantifying its official attendance figures \\"too much of a hassle\\", it is still consistently recognized as one of the most highly attended and best state fairs in America as well as Dallas's signature event.[2][3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe State Fair of Texas opening day ceremonies are highlighted by the annual Friday parade rolling through downtown Dallas.[5]\\r\\nTraditionally, the centerpiece of the fair has been the annual college football game between Oklahoma and Texas, nicknamed the Red River Rivalry (historically known as the \\"Texas-OU Game\\") and played in the Cotton Bowl at Fair Park. Also, the State Fair Classic, featuring Grambling State University and Prairie View A&M University, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the fair. In 2010, Baylor and Texas Tech played their game during the fair for the first time. During the opening weekend of the 2013 fair, Army and Louisiana Tech played in the only Heart of Dallas Classic at the Cotton Bowl; it was abandoned thereafter. The new Texas State Fair Football Showdown is scheduled to take place on the third weekend of the 2018 fair and will feature Southern and Texas Southern.[6]\\r\\nThe State Fair of Texas is the only fair in the US to include a full auto show, dating back to 1913.[7]\\r\\nThe State Fair used to feature \\"Birds of the World\\" where several birds flew overhead. It was removed from the Fair lineup in 2014. The Texas Skyway is a gondola ride which only operates 24 days a year transports visitors around the fairgrounds. Its construction cost 5 million dollars. There is also a BMX bike show as well as dog and pig races. For children, puppet shows, Children's Medical Center Barnyard, and Story Time also take place inside the fair.[8]\\r\\nIn recent years, the fair has emphasized its reputation as an event featuring unique, albeit high-fat foods. It has been known for years for Fletcher's brand corny dogs. Recent years have seen the introduction of new unusual deep-fried items, including deep-fried Oreos, deep-fried Twinkies, deep-fried s'mores, deep-fried pork ribs, fried cheesecake; deep-fried butter, deep-fried peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwiches, and most recently a batter-based fried Coke. New foods in 2008 included chicken fried bacon and fried banana splits. For the 2012 fair, the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas added the deep-fried Samoa cookie.[9]\\r\\nThe State Fair of Texas was originally charted as a private corporation by local businessmen. It was an immediate success and attracted thousands of people. However, in 1904 a series of events led to a financial crisis and not enough income was available to keep the fair running. Therefore, the businessmen sold it to the city of Dallas with the agreement that 24 days during the fall would be set aside annually for the fair and exhibition.[10]\\r\\nBig Tex, a 55-foot (17?m) tall cowboy statue, has been its symbol since his introduction in 1952. In 1953, Big Tex's jaw was hinged, so that he appears to \\"speak\\" the announcements that promote fair events.[11] After a fire on October 19, 2012 destroyed the original Big Tex, he was rebuilt and reintroduced for the 2013 fair.\\r\\nIts 212-foot (65?m) Texas Star Ferris wheel was the largest in North America when it debuted in October 1985, just months before the Texas Sesquicentennial. It has since been dwarfed by Ferris wheels in Las Vegas and Orlando.[7][12]\\r\\nDART's Fair Park Station and MLK Jr. Station opened in 2009 to serve Fair Park and the State Fair. In addition to regular service on the Green Line, the Red Line and Blue Line also run \\"special event\\" trains to Fair Park Station for major fair events.[13]\\r\\nControversies\\r\\nThe State Fair in 1966 commissioned a report on the redevelopment of the fair, which concluded that the land around Fair Park should be \`bought up and turned into a paved, lighted, fenced parking lot\\" that would \`eliminate the problem from sight'. \\"If the poor Negroes in their shacks cannot be seen, all the guilt feelingswill disappear, or at least be removed from primary consideration\\".\\r\\nThe State Fair came under fire in October 2014 for spending over $5,000,000 on attorneys fees to two insiders.[14]\\r\\nDespite a $30,000,000 investment in Summer Adventures, the event was shuttered after just one season.[15]\\r\\nIn August 2015, the State Fair was sanctioned more than $75,000 for filing a SLAPP suit[34] against a lawyer who had requested financial documents from the State Fair. On August 2, 2016, the Dallas Court of Appeals reversed in its entirety the judgment against the State Fair of Texas, holding that the trial court erred in, among other things, finding that the State Fair's lawsuit was a SLAPP suit.[16]\\r\\nThe economics, finances and management of the State Fair of Texas is a matter of public concern and study. The five main areas of concern are:\\r\\nStaff of the State Fair have traditionally reported that attendance at the fair runs in the vicinity each year of between 3 and 3.5 million people. These figures were disputed in an April 2016 study published by Tom Kelly, Ph.D, a professor of Economics at Baylor University and the Director of Baylor University Center for Business and Economic Research, along with Bennet Hickok, an Economics student at Baylor. The Kelly/Hickok report argues that the attendance at the fair is about 1.5-1.7 million visitors a year, or about half of what state fair staff reported it to be.[37]\\r\\nThe 2016 Kelly/Hickok study found that the State Fair generates around $50 million for the area economy. This is in contrast to the figure of $600 million in impact that the State Fair itself has traditionally reported.[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe State Fair has a lease with Fair Park, the terms of which require that any profit or excess revenue it generates be spent \\"for the development and enhancement of Fair Park and the Fair\\". In May 2016, the State Fair released a list of capital projects for the past 10 years, detailing how the fair had spent their excess revenue. According to media reports, 90% of excess revenue was spent on projects that solely benefited the State Fair. A survey of Fair Park revealed out of the 277 acres available, 200 are covered in asphalt or concrete, compared to 10 acres of green space.[41]\\r\\nIn 2014, Errol McKoy, the former President of the State Fair of Texas, received $1.425 million in compensation.[42][43][44]\\r\\nOn May 13, 2016, the City of Dallas Auditor, Craig Kinton, released an audit regarding Fair Park Business Partners, which included the State Fair of Texas. The audit concluded the City of Dallas had no way to ensure the State Fair was adequately investing in Fair Park, per the terms of the contract between the City of Dallas and State Fair.[45]","input":"What city is the texas state fair in?"},{"output":"eight Spanish reales","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish dollar, also known as the piece of eight (Spanish: peso de ocho or real de a ocho), is a silver coin, of approximately 38?mm diameter, worth eight Spanish reales, that was minted in the Spanish Empire after 1598. Its purpose was to correspond to the German thaler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish dollar (so called due to being approximately the same weight and fineness of the Dutch leeuwendaalder) was widely used by many countries as the first international/World currency because of its uniformity in standard and milling characteristics. Some countries countersigned the Spanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based, and it remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857. Because it was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it became the first world currency by the late 18th century.[2][3] Aside from the U.S. dollar, several other currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the Philippine peso, and several currencies in the rest of the Americas, were initially based on the Spanish dollar and other 8-real coins.[citation needed] Diverse theories link the origin of the \\"$\\" symbol to the columns and stripes that appear on one side of the Spanish dollar.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term peso was used in Spanish to refer to this denomination, and it became the basis for many of the currencies in the former Spanish colonies, including the Argentine, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Costa Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Mexican, Nicaraguan, Paraguayan, Philippine, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, Salvadoran, Uruguayan, and Venezuelan pesos. Of these, \\"peso\\" remains name of the official currency in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Philippines, and Uruguay.\\r\\n\\r\\nMillions of Spanish dollars were minted over the course of several centuries. They were among the most widely circulating coins of the colonial period in the Americas, and were still in use in North America and in South-East Asia in the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 16th century, Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting a coin known as a Joachimsthaler (from German thal, modern spelling Tal, \\"valley\\", cognate with \\"dale\\" in English), named for Joachimsthal, the valley in the Ore Mountains where the silver was mined (St. Joachim's Valley, now Jchymov; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, within the Holy Roman Empire, now part of the Czech Republic).[5] Joachimstaler was later shortened to taler, a word that eventually found its way into Norwegian, Danish and Swedish as daler, Russian as  (tler), Czech and Slovene as tolar, Polish as talar, Dutch as daalder, Amharic as ??? (talari), Hungarian as tallr, Italian as tallero, Greek as ? (taliro), Spanish tlero and English as dollar.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Joachimsthaler weighed 451 Troy grains (29.2 g) of silver. So successful were these coins that similar thalers were minted in Burgundy and France. The Burgundian Cross Thaler depicted the Cross of Burgundy and was prevalent in the Burgundian Netherlands that were revolting against the Spanish king and Duke of Burgundy Philip II. After 1575, the Dutch revolting provinces replaced the currency with a daalder depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name leeuwendaalder.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically to facilitate export trade, the leeuwendaalder was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine silver, lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation. Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendaalders rather than in other heavier, more costly coins. Thus, the leeuwendaalder or lion dollar became the coin of choice for foreign trade. It became popular in the Middle East, and colonies in the east and west.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries. From New Netherland (New York) the lion dollar spread to all thirteen colonies in the west. English speakers began to apply the word \\"dollar\\" also to the Spanish peso or \\"piece of eight\\" by 1581, which was also widely used in the British North American colonies at the time of the American Revolution, hence adopted as the name and weight of the US monetary unit in the late 18th century.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the introduction of the Guldengroschen in Austria in 1486, the concept of a large silver coin with high purity (sometimes known as \\"specie\\" coinage) eventually spread throughout the rest of Europe. Monetary reform in Spain brought about the introduction of an 8-real coin in 1497. In 1537 the Spanish escudo gold coin was introduced, which was worth 16 reales. The later Gold Doubloon was worth 32 reales or 2 escudos. It is this divisibility into 8 which caused the silver coins to be named \\"pieces of eight\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following centuries, the coin was minted with several different designs at various mints in Spain and the New World, having gained wide acceptance beyond Spain's borders. Thanks to the vast silver deposits that were found mainly in Potos in modern-day Bolivia and to a lesser extent in Mexico (for example, at Taxco & Zacatecas), and to silver from Spain's possessions throughout the Americas, mints in Mexico and Peru also began to strike the coin. The main New World mints for Spanish dollars were at Potos, Lima, and Mexico City (with minor mints at Bogot, Popayn, Guatemala City, and Santiago), and silver dollars from these mints could be distinguished from those minted in Spain by the Pillars of Hercules design on the reverse. In the 19th century, the coin's denomination was changed to 20 reales (based on 20 reales de vell܇n) and finally 2 escudos.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpain's adoption of the peseta in 1869 and its joining the Latin Monetary Union meant the effective end of the last vestiges of the Spanish dollar in Spain itself. However, the 5-peseta coin (or duro) was slightly smaller and lighter but was also of high purity (90%) silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1990s, commemorative 2000-peseta coins were minted, similar in size and weight to the 8 reales and also with high fineness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing independence in 1821, Mexican coinage of silver reales and gold escudos followed that of Spanish lines until decimalization and the introduction of the peso. The Mexican 8-reales coin (eventually becoming a 1-peso coin) continued to be a popular international trading coin throughout the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 1918, the peso was reduced in size and fineness, with further reductions in the 1940s and 1950s. However, 2- (1921), 5- (1947) and 10- (1955) peso coins were minted during the same period with sizes and fineness similar to the old peso.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term cob was used in Ireland and the British colonies to mean a piece of eight or a Spanish-American dollar, because Spanish-American gold and silver coins were irregularly shaped and crudely struck during this period. The ends of bars or \\"cabos de barra\\" which the term \\"cob\\" came about were cut/sliced off bullion rods as planchets (flan) which are round metal disks used as blanks which were to be stamped into coins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the colony of New South Wales was founded in Australia in 1788, it ran into the problem of a lack of coinage, particularly since trading vessels took coins out of the colony in exchange for their cargo. In 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie made creative use of S10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To make it difficult to take the coins out of the colony, and to double their number, the centres of the coins were punched out. The punched centre, known as the \\"dump\\", was valued at 15 pence, and the outer rim, known as the \\"holey dollar\\", was worth five shillings. This was indicated by over-stamping the two new coins. The obverse of the holey dollar was stamped the words \\"New South Wales\\" and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words \\"five shillings\\". The obverse of the dump was stamped with a crown, the words \\"New South Wales\\" and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words \\"fifteen pence\\". The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia.[9] The expedient was relatively short lived. The British Parliament passed the Sterling Silver Money Act in 1825, which made British coins the only recognised form of currency and ended any legitimate use of the holey dollar and dump in the Australian colonies.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coinage Act of 1792 created the United States Mint, but the first U.S. dollars were not as popular as the Spanish dollars, which were heavier and were made of finer silver. Indeed:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy far the leading specie coin circulating in America was the Spanish silver dollar, defined as consisting of 387 grains of pure silver. The dollar was divided into \\"pieces of eight,\\" or \\"bits,\\" each consisting of one-eighth of a dollar. Spanish dollars came into the North American colonies through lucrative trade with the West Indies. The Spanish silver dollar had been the world's outstanding coin since the early 16th century, and was spread partially by dint of the vast silver output of the Spanish colonies in Latin America. More important, however, was that the Spanish dollar, from the 16th to the 19th century, was relatively the most stable and least debased coin in the Western world.\\r\\n[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn dollar nominally weighed 550.209 Spanish grains, which is 423.900 troy/avoirdupois grains (0.883125 troy ounces or 27.468 grams), 0.93055 fine, so contained 0.821791 troy ounces (25.561?g) or 394.460 grains fine silver. Its weight and purity varied significantly between mints and over the centuries. In contrast, the Coinage Act of 1792 specified that the U.S. dollar would contain ?371?4?16?grain (24.1?g) pure or 416?grain (27.0?g) standard silver. This specification was based on the average weight of a random selection of worn Spanish dollars which Alexander Hamilton caused to be weighed at the Treasury.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coins had a nominal value of eight reales (\\"royals\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the American Revolution, owing to British mercantilist policies, there was a chronic shortage of British currency in Britain's colonies. Trade was often conducted with Spanish dollars that had been obtained through illicit trade with the West Indies. Spanish coinage was legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857 discontinued the practice. The pricing of equities on U.S. stock exchanges in ?1?8-dollar denominations persisted until the New York Stock Exchange converted first to pricing in sixteenths of a dollar on 24 June 1997, and shortly after that, to decimal pricing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong tied to the lore of piracy, \\"pieces of eight\\" were manufactured in the Americas and transported in bulk back to Spain, making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. The Manila galleons transported Mexican silver to Manila in the Spanish Philippines, where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would accept. In Oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as \\"chop marks\\" which indicated that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined to be genuine. The specifications of the Spanish dollar became a standard for trade in the Far East, with later Western powers issuing trade dollars, and colonial currencies such as the Hong Kong dollar, to the same specifications.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Chinese yuan coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names \\"yuan\\" and \\"dollar\\" in the Chinese language.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn modern pop culture and fiction, \\"Pieces of Eight\\" are most often associated with the popular notion of pirates.","input":"How much is a piece of eight worth?"},{"output":"N.

The franchisee was transferred to a separate entity named Chennai Super Kings Cricket Ltd., after the Supreme Court of India struck down the controversial amendment to the BCCI constitution's clause 6.2.4 that allowed board officials to have a commercial interest in the IPL and the Champions League T20 on January 22, 2015.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008,Tamil actor Super Thalapathy Joseph Vijay was a celebrity for two years (2008&2009), the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey.[8] Dhoni became the costliest player of the auction, as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million.[9] The franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.[10] They played their first game on April 19, 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240/5 in 20 overs, which was the highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by themselves in 2010.[11] The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished third on the points table.[12] They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal.[13] The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the Super Kings scored 163/5 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.[14] They also earned a spot in the inaugural Champions League Twenty20 along with Rajasthan, but the tournament was cancelled due to the 2008 Mumbai Attacks and the Super Kings, along with Rajasthan, received $5 million each as compensation.[15] Fleming, who had decided to retire from all forms of the game after the first season of the IPL, took over as the coach of the Super Kings team from Wessels for the next season which was to be held in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 2009 season, the Super Kings bought English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff for $1.55?million at the auction making him the highest-paid IPL cricketer along with English teammate Kevin Pietersen who was bought for the same amount by Royal Challengers Bangalore.[16] However, Flintoff played only 3 matches for them before suffering a knee injury that ruled him out of the season. The Super Kings were also without the services of Hussey who had decided to skip the IPL season to focus on The Ashes.[17] The Super Kings finished with 17 points from 14 matches and earned a second place at the league table.[18] However, at the semi-finals, their hopes of entering the final for a second time were crushed by the Royal Challengers who beat them by 6 wickets.[19] The Super Kings opener Matthew Hayden, who scored 572 runs in 12 innings with 5 half-centuries at an average of 52 and strike-rate of 145, won the Orange Cap for the leading run-scorer of the season[20] and was also adjudged Player of the Tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the Super Kings struggled in the first half of the regular season, winning only two matches out of seven. They won four of their next five games in the season mainly due to the efforts of Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina. After a defeat at home to the Delhi Daredevils, the Super Kings were left with a must-win match against Kings XI Punjab at Dharamshala. The Super Kings won the match by six wickets as they chased down the target of 193 with two balls to spare with skipper Dhoni scoring an unbeaten 54 from 29 balls.[21] Thus, with seven wins from 14 matches, Chennai finished with the same number of points as three other teams with two semi-final spots at stake. Chennai got the third place as they had the better net run rate of the four teams which finished on 14 points.[22] In the semifinal, the Super Kings scored a modest 142/7 in 20 overs against the defending champions Deccan Chargers. But an inspired bowling spell from Doug Bollinger (4/13 in four overs) did the most damage as the Chargers were bowled out for 104. This gave the Super Kings a 38-run victory that took them to the final.[23] The Super Kings faced the tournament favorites Mumbai Indians at their home ground in the final.[24] Suresh Raina's 57 (35) helped the Super Kings recover from 68/3 after 12 overs to put up 168/5 at the end of their 20 overs. Then, their spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Muralitharan conceded only 41 runs in the 8 overs bowled between them to help the Super Kings won the game by 22 runs and secure their first ever IPL title.[25] With this, the Super Kings also qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 that was held in South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the Champions League, the Super Kings were placed in Group A along with champions of Twenty20 competitions from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The Super Kings topped the Group table with three wins and a Super Over defeat to the Victorian Bushrangers.[26] In the semi-final at Durban, the Super Kings comprehensively defeated IPL rivals Royal Challengers Bangalore by 52 runs. Raina won the Man of the match for his unbeaten 94 off 48 balls.[27] The Super Kings played their first CLT20 final at Johannesburg where they beat the Chevrolet Warriors by 8 wickets, becoming the first IPL team to win the CLT20.[28] Murali Vijay won not only the Man of the Match in the final for his 58 but also the Golden Bat for scoring the most runs in the tournament and Ashwin, who was the leading wicket-taker, was adjudged the Player of the Series. At the end of the season, Matthew Hayden decided to retire from the IPL.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, as two new teams were added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, and the rest of the international players would be put in the mega-auction. The Chennai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain MS Dhoni, vice-captain Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay and all-rounder Albie Morkel for a total of $4.5 million. The retention left them with the power of spending only $4.5 million at the mega-auction. At the auction, they bought back some of their star players of previous seasons such as Hussey, Ashwin, Bollinger and Subramaniam Badrinath. In the 2011 IPL, they lost three of their first five games which placed them at the bottom of the ten-team points table.[29] But then, they went on to win seven of their next eight games to finish second and register a spot in the knockout stages. They faced the top-ranked team Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifying final which they won by 6 wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Suresh Raina.[30] In the final, they faced the same opponents again, which was held at their home ground Chepauk. Vijay and Hussey put on a 133-run first-wicket partnership that helped the Super Kings to post a total of 205/5. Their bowlers, then, restricted Bangalore to only 147 to take the Super Kings to second consecutive title in the IPL. Vijay was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 95.[31] CSK also won all their home games that season becoming the first team in IPL to achieve the feat. However at the Champions League later that year, they won only one out of their four group matches and finished at the bottom.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the franchise signed up Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for $2 million at the players' auction.[33] They got off to a rather slow start in the regular season, winning only five of their first 12 games which put them in doubt of qualifying for the Playoffs. Then they won three of their last four matches and qualified for the Playoffs with a better net run rate than the Royal Challengers who also finished with the same number of points.[34] In the Eliminator, they beat the Mumbai Indians by 38 runs before comprehensively beating the table-toppers Delhi Daredevils in the Qualifying final by 86 runs. Murali Vijay, who struck his second IPL hundred (113 off 58 balls), won the Man of the Match.[35] At the final, the Super Kings were defeated by 5 wickets by the Kolkata Knight Riders who chased down the target of 191 with two balls to spare, thus denying the Super Kings a hat-trick of titles in the IPL.[36] At the Champions League, once again they could not progress past the group stage with two wins and two defeats.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, the Super Kings strengthened their bowling attack by signing up five overseas and five Indian bowlers.[38] In the IPL season, they finished first in the points table with 11 wins from 16 matches and qualified for the Playoffs and 2013 CLT20.[39] This was the first time in six seasons that the Super Kings had topped the league table of the IPL. During the season, they also equaled Royal Challengers Bangalore's 2011 record for most wins in succession in the IPL (7 wins on trot).[40] In the first Qualifier at Delhi against Mumbai Indians, the Super Kings posted 192/1 in 20 overs riding on unbeaten half-centuries from Hussey (86* off 58 balls) and Raina (82* off 42 balls) before bowling out their opponents for 144.[41] Thus they entered the final of the IPL for the fourth time in succession where they would play the same opponents, Mumbai Indians, at Kolkata. At the final, batting first, the Mumbai Indians made 148/9 in their 20 overs. In reply, the Super Kings were reduced to 39/6 at one stage before an unbeaten half-century from skipper Dhoni took them close to the target. However, Mumbai Indians won the match by 23 runs to win their first ever IPL title.[42] Super Kings opening batsman Michael Hussey, who scored 733 runs that season at an average of 52, won the Orange Cap for the most runs in the season while all-rounder Dwayne Bravo won the Purple Cap for bagging the most wickets (32).[43] The Super Kings gained direct qualification for the 2013 CLT20 which was held in India in SeptemberÿOctober. They were placed in Group B alongside Brisbane Heat, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Titans and Trinidad & Tobago. They won their first three games before losing the final group match against Trinidad & Tobago. With 12 points from four matches,[44] the Super Kings progressed to the semifinals where they suffered a 14-run defeat at the hands of the Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, before the players' mega-auction, Chennai retained Dhoni, Raina, Jadeja, Ashwin and Bravo. The retention left them with a purse of ?21 crores to spend at the auction. At the auction, the franchise bought the likes of Brendon McCullum, Dwayne Smith, Faf du Plessis, Ashish Nehra, Mohit Sharma among others. The first phase of the IPL season, as it coincided with the general elections, was held in UAE. The second phase returned to India, but the Super Kings' home matches were shifted from Chennai, due to \\"a deadlock between stadium authorities and the state administration\\", to JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi.[46][47] The Super Kings started the season with a defeat in the opening match, after which they went on to win eight of their next nine matches to take the first spot in the points table. However, they suffered a loss of form towards the end of the regular season which resulted in three consecutive defeats.[48] They won their last league fixture and finished third in the points table and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Mumbai Indians. They won the Eliminator at Mumbai by 7 wickets and qualified for the Qualifier. At the Qualifier against Kings XI Punjab, the Super Kings won the toss and elected to field. Punjab went on to score 226/6 in their 20 overs. The Super Kings, in reply, could manage only 202/7 despite a 25-ball 87 from Raina.[49] They crashed out of the IPL, but, on account of finishing third, qualified for the main event of the 2014 CLT20. In the group stage of the CLT20, the Super Kings won two matches, lost one while another match was a no result. Thus with 10 points they finished second in the group table[50] and qualified for the semifinal where they met the unbeaten team of the other group, Kings XI Punjab. After being put in to bat, the Super Kings posted 182/7 in 20 overs thanks to Bravo who scored a 39-ball 67. Then their bowlers reduced Punjab to 34/6 in the eighth over, and Punjab were eventually bowled out for 117.[51] At the final in Bangalore, the Super Kings faced the IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders who set them a target of 181 in 20 overs. Raina guided the run-chase with an unbeaten 109 off 62 balls, helping the team to an eight-wicket win and their second CLT20 title.[52] Super Kings spinner Pawan Negi who took 5/22 during Kolkata's innings won the Man of the Match, and Raina, who finished as the highest run-getter of the tournament, was awarded Man of the Tournament.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, before the players' auction, Chennai Super Kings gave away Ben Hilfenhaus, John Hastings, Vijay Shankar and David Hussey. At the auction they bought back Michael Hussey for a price of Rs.1.5 crores. They also bought Kyle Abbott, Irfan Pathan, Andrew Tye, Eklavya Dwivedi, Ankush Bains, Pratyush Singh and Rahul Sharma. In the final, they lost against Mumbai.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAhead of the players mega auction, Chennai Super Kings retained Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Suresh Raina & Ravindra Jadeja. Additionally, Faf du Plessis and Dwayne Bravo were brought back into the side using RTM. The return of the Super Kings to the IPL was the cause of a large amount of celebration and fanfare amongst the fans, with a crowd of more than 10,000 turning up for the practice sessions held at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai before the start of the tournament.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nChennai's campaign started off with a thrilling one wicket win over the Mumbai Indians in the first match of the season.[56] Playing their first home game in Chennai, the Kings successfully managed to chase down a target of 202 set by the Kolkata Knight Riders, aided by a quickfire half-century by Sam Billings. The team then went on to lose to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali but bounced back by winning three matches in a row against the Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings' next eight matches resulted in them alternating between victories and defeats by winning against the Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kings XI Punjab and losing against the Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Delhi Daredevils and the Kolkata Knight Riders.[57] The league stage ended with the Super Kings in second place behind the Sunrisers.[58] Chennai then went on to post back-to-back victories against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the first qualifier and in the final to win the Indian Premier League for the third time since the inception of the tournament.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree of the five centuries scored in the 2018 season were by players belonging to the Chennai Super Kings (Ambati Rayudu 100* and Shane Watson 106, 117*). The Super Kings also became the first team to defeat an opposing team (Sunrisers Hyderabad) four times in a single season.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home ground of the Super Kings is the historic M. A. Chidambaram Stadium (commonly called \\"The Chepauk\\") located in Chennai. The stadium is named after former BCCI President M. A. Chidambaram. It is the oldest stadium in India which is in continuous use. The stadium is owned by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and has a seating capacity of 50,000 as of May 2013.[62] In 2010, the stadium underwent a major renovation for hosting some of the matches of the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup. The seating capacity was increased from 36,000 to 50,000 and three new stands were established during this renovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Super Kings have a 67.44% win record at this venue, which is often referred to as \\"Fortress Chepauk\\"[63] and \\"Lions' den\\".[64] In the 2011 season, the Super Kings won all their home games (8 matches) including the final against Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings thus became the first team to win all their home games in a season and also the first team to win the tournament at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, Chennai Super Kings played all their home matches at Ranchi due to issues with Government of Tamil Nadu.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, Chennai Super Kings managed to play a solitary home game against Kolkata Knight Riders due to members of a few fringe political parties staging protests outside the stadium as well as several parts of Chennai demanding the IPL matches to be moved out of the city until the Cauvery Management Board (CMB) was set up as directed by the honourable Supreme Court of India. Despite tight security for the match against KKR, the Chennai police expressed their inability in ensuring enough personnel at the venue for the smooth conduct of the remaining games. The remaining six home matches of Chennai Super Kings were moved out of Chennai. Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune was selected to host the remaining six home matches of Chennai Super Kings.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nMahendra Singh Dhoni, who was the captain of the Indian limited-overs team in 2008, was bought by the Super Kings for $1.5 million at the 2008 players' auction. He was the most expensive player in the IPL until 2009 when the Super Kings signed up English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff for $1.55 million. Dhoni is one of the most successful captains in the IPL, having led the Super Kings to seven finals of which the team has won three.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vice-captain of the team from 2008 to 2015 was Suresh Raina. Raina holds multiple IPL records such as most caps, most runs and most catches.[67] Australian batsman Michael Hussey has the best batting average for the Super Kings.[68] He was the first batsman from the Super Kings to score a century in the IPL. After Matthew Hayden's retirement in 2010, Hussey took over his place of opening batsman and was the team's leading run-scorer in 2011 and 2013 seasons.[69][70] Murali Vijay, who played for the team from 2009 to 2013, is the first Indian batsman to score two centuries in the IPL. Super Kings' spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has the third best economy rate in IPL (6.53)[71] and is the leading wicket-taker for the team.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai franchise named the team as Chennai Super Kings to honor the rulers of the Tamil empire. The word \\"super\\" is used commonly in southern India especially in Tamil Nadu. The team name also derives from India Cements' brand \\"Coromandel King\\".[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team logo features the head of a roaring lion in orange and the team name rendered in blue. The crown above the team name is the same as that used in the logo of the brand Coromandel King. According to the logo designers, since lion is the king of the jungle, the roaring lion logo reflects the team name. The details of the logo signifies various qualities such as youth, vibrancy, solid performance orientation and fiery spirit.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's primary colour is yellow with blue and orange stripes on either sides of the jersey. The jersey also incorporates the roaring lion logo in the center of the shirt below the logo of the main sponsor Muthoot Group. The basic look of the jersey has remained same from the first season with no changes except for the sponsor placement. The kit manufacturer until 2014 was Reebok and from 2015, Australian Apparel and Sports Gear manufacturer Spartan manufactures kits for the team.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuthoot Group is the current principal shirt sponsor, having signed a three year deal in 2018.[75] Telecom service provider Aircel was the previous shirt sponsor after they signed a three-year deal in 2008 which was then renewed in 2011 for ? 850?million, then the most expensive sponsorship deal in IPL.[76][77] The team also has sponsorship deals with India Cements, Gulf Oil, Equitas Small Finance Bank, HIL, Nippon Paint, Parle Agro Frooti and Atria Convergence Technologies.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's theme song is the Whistle Podu designed by Aravind-Shankar (duo of Aravind Murali and Jaishankar Iyer). Although the track was created only for YouTube in 2008, it gained popularity during the 2009 season and later became the team's theme song. The video of the song represents the street dance form of dappangutthu which is very popular among certain communities in Tamil Nadu. It is also a folk dance and music genre employed in Tamil cinema. The recordings of some of the Super Kings players whistling were used in the music video.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai Super Kings are the most consistent and their records are still left unbeaten despite the 2 years ban in 2016, 2017 seasons. Though other teams consider CSK as a strong rival, Chennai Super Kings record of reaching knockout stage every played season is unmatched by any team in IPL history.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chennai Super Kings have active rivalries with the Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore. The Super Kings and Mumbai Indians have played against each other more number of times than any other two teams in the IPL.[80] They are the two most successful IPL teams and often termed as \\"big spenders\\" at the players auction.[81][82] The two sides have met each other at the final of the IPL thrice, with Mumbai winning two of them and Chennai winning once.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rivalry with Royal Challengers Bangalore stems from the Kaveri River water dispute between the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The rivalry is also called \\"Kaveri derby\\" and \\"South Indian derby\\".[83][84][85] The Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers in the final of the 2011 IPL, the only meeting between the two teams at an IPL final.\\r\\n\\r\\nCSK was adjugded by Brand Finance to be the most valuable brand at $65 Million USD after the completion of IPL 2018 with the team lifting its third title in a dream return, tying them along with Mumbai Indians as the most successful team of IPL with three titles each.[86]. The Economic Times commissioned UK-based Brand Finance to carry out brand evaluation of the IPL and also each of the eight franchise teams (that was increased to 10 in 2011). Chennai Super Kings was rated as the \\"most valuable team\\" in the Indian Premier League in 2010ÿ11, with a brand value of $100\\r\\nmillion (approximately ? 2.24?billion).[87] In February 2013, London based Brand Finance evaluated the top 150 most valuable teams in the world, in which Chennai Super Kings is placed in the 147th place valued at $46 million just behind the Mumbai Indians.[88].\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil September 2008, BCCI regulation, Clause 6.2.4 stated that \\"No administrator could have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in the matches or events conducted by the board\\". However, N. Srinivasan, who was then the treasurer and vice-chairman of BCCI, became the de facto owner of the Chennai Super Kings since he was the Managing Director of India Cements. Former BCCI President A. C. Muthiah wrote to the BCCI regarding the violation of this clause in 2008 but the BCCI did not respond. In September 2008, Muthiah went to the Madras High Court to restrain BCCI from allowing Srinivasan to participate in the general body meeting where the election was to be held. However, the suit was dismissed by the High Court and the following day, Srinivasan was elected as the Secretary of BCCI.[89] The clause was amended as \\"No administrator shall have, directly or indirectly, any commercial interest in any of the events of the BCCI, excluding IPL, Champions League and Twenty20\\".[90] Muthiah then moved to the Supreme Court which gave a split verdict in April 2011. Later in August 2011, Muthiah filed another petition to stop Srinivasan from taking over as the BCCI President[91] but the Supreme Court rejected the petition, and Srinivasan was elected the President of BCCI.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, the owners of other teams were concerned about the possible rigging that could have taken place in the IPL auctions. Nita Ambani, the owner of Mumbai Indians questioned the changing the order of players just before the auction began.[93] Former IPL chairman Lalit Modi accused Srinivasan of arm-twisting him and rigging the 2009 IPL auction to ensure that English all-rounder Andrew Flintoff was bought by the Chennai Super Kings while it was refuted by Srinivasan.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of Srinivasan, was arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of placing bets on IPL matches [95] Meiyappan, who was the Team Principal of the Super Kings, was issued a summons by the Mumbai Police and on interrogation it was found that Meiyappan was in contact with bookies through actor Vindu Dara Singh.[96] Following this, Srinivasan, on 2 June 2013, decided to step aside as BCCI President temporarily until the inquiry into the betting case completed.[97] In February 2014, the three member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India enquired into the betting case indicted Meiyappan for illegal betting during the 2013 IPL.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India issued an ultimatum to the BCCI demanding that Srinivasan either step down as President or be removed from his position.[99] On 14 July 2015, the Supreme Court appointed RM Lodha committee suspended the owners of Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings from the Indian Premier League for a period of two years.[2] On 24 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a plea for lifting the ban on the Chennai Super Kings.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy opposition[107]\\r\\n\\r\\n Last updated: 5 May 2018\\r\\n\\r\\n2008 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2009 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 Champions League\\r\\n\\r\\n2011 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2013 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2014 Indian Premier League\\r\\n\\r\\n2014 Champions League\\r\\n\\r\\n2015 Indian Premier league\\r\\n\\r\\n2018 Indian Premier league","input":"Who was the owner of chennai super kings?"},{"output":"Andy Borowitz","context":"Quincy Jones\\r\\nAndy Borowitz\\r\\nSusan Borowitz\\r\\nKevin Wendle (Season 1)\\r\\nWinifred Hervey (Seasons 2ÿ3)\\r\\nGary H.

The show stars Will Smith as a fictionalized version of himself, a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia who is sent to move in with his wealthy aunt and uncle in their Bel Air mansion after getting into a fight on a local basketball court. In the series, his lifestyle often clashes with the lifestyle of his relatives in Bel Air. The series ran for six seasons and aired 148 episodes.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1989, NBC approached Will Smith, a popular rapper during the late 1980s.[3] The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990.[4] Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May 1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996.[5][6]\\r\\nThe theme song \\"Yo Home to Bel Air\\" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, The Fresh Prince. The music was composed by Quincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.\\r\\nIn the second season, the kitchen and living room sets were rebuilt much larger with a more contemporary style (as opposed to the much more formal style of the first season) and were connected directly by an archway, allowing scenes to be shot continuously between the sets.\\r\\nThe theme song and opening sequence set the premise of the show. Will Smith is a street smart teenager, born and raised in West Philadelphia. While playing basketball, Will misses a shot and the ball hits a group of people, causing a confrontation that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his aunt and uncle in the opulent neighborhood of Bel Air, Los Angeles.\\r\\nWill's working-class background ends up clashing in various humorous ways with the upper class world of the Banks family ÿ Will's uncle Phil and aunt Vivian and their children, Will's cousins: Hilary, Carlton, and Ashley.\\r\\nDuring the fall 1991ÿ1992 season, NBC gained two hit television shows to anchor their Monday night lineup (Blossom aired immediately after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air). To gain popularity between the two shows, Will Smith appeared in the Blossom episode \\"I'm with the Band\\" as himself under his rap stage name, The Fresh Prince. That same season, Karyn Parsons appeared in the Blossom episode \\"Wake Up Little Suzy\\" as Hilary Banks. Parsons also appeared in the Patti LaBelle sitcom, Out All Night as Hilary.\\r\\nIn the House and Fresh Prince were both executive produced by Winifred Hervey, David Salzman and Quincy Jones. During the second season's first episode, Alfonso Ribeiro and Tatyana Ali appeared as their Fresh Prince characters (Carlton and Ashley Banks) in the crossover episode \\"Dog Catchers\\". Later that season, James Avery (Phillip Banks) appeared as a mediator in the episode \\"Love on a One-Way Street\\".\\r\\nIn the Season 4 episode \\"My Pest Friend's Wedding\\", James Avery and Daphne Maxwell Reid (Vivian Banks) guest starred as Dr. Maxwell Stanton's parents (Stanton was played by Ribeiro). Both Avery and Reid portrayed the parents of Ribeiro's Fresh Prince character. Joseph Marcell, who played the wisecracking Geoffrey Butler on Fresh Prince, also appeared as an officiating minister in the same episode.\\r\\nThe series was produced by NBC Productions in association with The Stuffed Dog Company and Quincy Jones Entertainment (later Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment in 1993). After the show was released to syndication in 1994, the series has been distributed by Warner Bros. Television, which continues to distribute the show worldwide (although NBCUniversal does own the series' copyright). WGN America was the first cable channel to acquire the series in 1997, TBS acquired the series a year later in 1998; both channels carried the series until the fall of 2003, though TBS reacquired the series in 2007.\\r\\nThe theme song was shown in the original TBS run, but after TBS re-acquired Fresh Prince in 2007, the opening credits were truncated and the theme song removed and replaced with the instrumental version used as the show's closing theme; these versions also re added portions of scenes cut from the original syndicated prints for some episodes, particularly those from Seasons 3 to 6. TBS continues to air the series today, early in the morning. Reruns also aired on WPIX-TV back to back weeknights at 6 pm & 6:30 pm EST from 1994 until 2000, and as a weekday basis at 5 pm from 2000 to 2005, sometimes on weekends until 2007. But, the series was still rerunning on The WB's affiliation WPIX-TV until 2006.\\r\\nWhile moving The WB to Nick at Nite, it was airing to 2006-2009 and moved to Disney XD.\\r\\nIn July 2009, Disney XD acquired the rights to the series, though it was quickly moved from prime time to late night airings, and only episodes from Seasons 1 to 3 are aired, mainly because those episodes are more appropriate for young viewers and does not contain as many mature themes, sexual content and strong language as later episodes. But in August 2010, Disney XD stopped airing the show.\\r\\nABC Family (now called Freeform) acquired the series in September 2008, though airing all 148 episodes; originally airing exclusively on Saturday nights, the series was added to ABC Family's weekday line up in late 2009. On September 29, 2014, Disney/ABC rights to the show expired. Viacom Media Networks got the series back.\\r\\nIn October 2014, Viacom Media Networks also gave the series to BET, it also will air on Centric. It was previously aired on MTV's retro block. Also, the series reruns on VH1. On November 2, 2015, the series started airing on the Family Channel in Canada. On January 1, 2017, the series was added to Netflix in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\\r\\nIn 2014, Fresh Prince Of Bel Air started airing again in Nickelodeon\`s block night channel, Nick at Nite.\\r\\nWarner Home Video has released the complete series, seasons 1 to 6 on DVD in Region 1.[7] Seasons 1 to 4 have been released in Regions 2 and 4. Seasons 5 to 6 have been released in Region 2 in Germany, and in the complete series boxset in the United Kingdom. The episodes and DVD menus are in English; only the DVD packaging is in German.\\r\\nOn August 13, 2015, it was reported that a reboot of the show was in development by Overbrook Entertainment, with Will Smith serving as a producer.[22][23] While the original aired on NBC, a network for the reboot has yet to be determined.[24] In August 2016, during a promotional interview with the E! television network, for his then upcoming film Suicide Squad, Smith had denied that a reboot was in development, saying that it would happen \\"...pretty close to when Hell freezes over.\\"[25]","input":"Who created the fresh prince of bel air?"},{"output":"seven","context":"The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The original version of the model defined seven layers.\\r\\nA layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that comprise the contents of that path. Two instances at the same layer are visualized as connected by a horizontal connection in that layer.\\r\\nThe model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), maintained by the identification ISO/IEC 7498-1.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1970s, one project was administered by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), while another was undertaken by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT, from French: Comit Consultatif International Tlphonique et Tlgraphique). These two international standards bodies each developed a document that defined similar networking models.\\r\\nIn 1983, these two documents were merged to form a standard called The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection. The standard is usually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, the OSI Reference Model, or simply the OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, as standard ISO 7498, and the renamed CCITT (now called the Telecommunications Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union or ITU-T) as standard X.200.\\r\\nOSI had two major components, an abstract model of networking, called the Basic Reference Model or seven-layer model, and a set of specific protocols.\\r\\nThe concept of a seven-layer model was provided by the work of Charles Bachman at Honeywell Information Services. Various aspects of OSI design evolved from experiences with the ARPANET, NPLNET, EIN, CYCLADES network and the work in IFIP WG6.1. The new design was documented in ISO 7498 and its various addenda. In this model, a networking system was divided into layers. Within each layer, one or more entities implement its functionality. Each entity interacted directly only with the layer immediately beneath it, and provided facilities for use by the layer above it.\\r\\nProtocols enable an entity in one host to interact with a corresponding entity at the same layer in another host. Service definitions abstractly described the functionality provided to an (N)-layer by an (N-1) layer, where N was one of the seven layers of protocols operating in the local host.\\r\\nThe OSI standards documents are available from the ITU-T as the X.200-series of recommendations.[1] Some of the protocol specifications were also available as part of the ITU-T X series. The equivalent ISO and ISO/IEC standards for the OSI model were available from ISO. Not all are free of charge.[2]\\r\\nThe recommendation X.200 describes seven layers, labeled 1 to 7. Layer 1 is the lowest layer in this model.\\r\\nAt each level N, two entities at the communicating devices (layer N peers) exchange protocol data units (PDUs) by means of a layer N protocol. Each PDU contains a payload, called the service data unit (SDU), along with protocol-related headers or footers.\\r\\nData processing by two communicating OSI-compatible devices is done as such:\\r\\nSome orthogonal aspects, such as management and security, involve all of the layers (See ITU-T X.800 Recommendation[4]). These services are aimed at improving the CIA triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability - of the transmitted data. In practice, the availability of a communication service is determined by the interaction between network design and network management protocols. Appropriate choices for both of these are needed to protect against denial of service.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe physical layer defines the electrical and physical specifications of the data connection. It defines the relationship between a device and a physical transmission medium (for example, an electrical cable, an optical fiber cable, or a radio frequency link). This includes the layout of pins, voltages, line impedance, cable specifications, signal timing and similar characteristics for connected devices and frequency (5?GHz or 2.4?GHz etc.) for wireless devices. It is responsible for transmission and reception of unstructured raw data in a physical medium. Bit rate control is done at the physical layer. It may define transmission mode as simplex, half duplex, and full duplex. It defines the network topology as bus, mesh, or ring being some of the most common.\\r\\nThe physical layer is the layer of low-level networking equipment, such as some hubs, cabling, and repeaters. The physical layer is never concerned with protocols or other such higher-layer items. Examples of hardware in this layer are network adapters, repeaters, network hubs, modems, and fiber media converters.\\r\\nThe data link layer provides node-to-node data transfera link between two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.\\r\\nIEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:[5]\\r\\nThe MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi, and 802.15.4 ZigBee operate at the data link layer.\\r\\nThe Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) is a data link layer protocol that can operate over several different physical layers, such as synchronous and asynchronous serial lines.\\r\\nThe ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides high-speed local area networking over existing wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables), includes a complete data link layer that provides both error correction and flow control by means of a selective-repeat sliding-window protocol.\\r\\nThe network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called datagrams) from one node to another connected in \\"different networks\\". A network is a medium to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may, but does not need to, report delivery errors.\\r\\nMessage delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message delivery, but it need not do so.\\r\\nA number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the management annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the protocol that carries them.[6]\\r\\nThe transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.\\r\\nThe transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the transport layer can keep track of the segments and re-transmit those that fail delivery. The transport layer also provides the acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next data if no errors occurred. The transport layer creates packets out of the message received from the application layer. Packetizing is the process of dividing a long message into smaller messages.\\r\\nOSI defines five classes of connection-mode transport protocols ranging from class 0 (which is also known as TP0 and provides the fewest features) to class 4 (TP4, designed for less reliable networks, similar to the Internet). Class 0 contains no error recovery, and was designed for use on network layers that provide error-free connections. Class 4 is closest to TCP, although TCP contains functions, such as the graceful close, which OSI assigns to the session layer. Also, all OSI TP connection-mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries. Detailed characteristics of TP0-4 classes are shown in the following table:[7]\\r\\nAn easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a post office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail and parcels sent. A post office inspects only the outer envelope of mail to determine its delivery. Higher layers may have the equivalent of double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunneling protocols operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such as IBM's SNA or Novell's IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload takes place only at endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete frames or packets to deliver to an endpoint. L2TP carries PPP frames inside transport packet.\\r\\nAlthough not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4 protocols within OSI.\\r\\nThe session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application. It provides for full-duplex, half-duplex, or simplex operation, and establishes checkpointing, adjournment, termination, and restart procedures. The OSI model made this layer responsible for graceful close of sessions, which is a property of the Transmission Control Protocol, and also for session checkpointing and recovery, which is not usually used in the Internet Protocol Suite. The session layer is commonly implemented explicitly in application environments that use remote procedure calls.\\r\\nThe presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them. If a mapping is available, presentation service data units are encapsulated into session protocol data units and passed down the protocol stack.\\r\\nThis layer provides independence from data representation by translating between application and network formats. The presentation layer transforms data into the form that the application accepts. This layer formats data to be sent across a network. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.[8] The presentation layer can include compression functions.[9] The Presentation Layer negotiates the Transfer Syntax.\\r\\nThe original presentation structure used the Basic Encoding Rules of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), with capabilities such as converting an EBCDIC-coded text file to an ASCII-coded file, or serialization of objects and other data structures from and to XML. ASN.1 effectively makes an application protocol invariant with respect to syntax.\\r\\nThe application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. This layer interacts with software applications that implement a communicating component. Such application programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer functions typically include identifying communication partners, determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the identity and availability of communication partners for an application with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the application layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the application. For example, a reservation website might have two application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and one for a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of these protocols have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in the application itself. The application layer per se has no means to determine the availability of resources in the network.\\r\\nCross-layer functions are services that are not tied to a given layer, but may affect more than one layer. Examples include the following:\\r\\nNeither the OSI Reference Model nor OSI protocols specify any programming interfaces, other than deliberately abstract service specifications. Protocol specifications precisely define the interfaces between different computers, but the software interfaces inside computers, known as network sockets are implementation-specific.\\r\\nFor example, Microsoft Windows' Winsock, and Unix's Berkeley sockets and System V Transport Layer Interface, are interfaces between applications (layer 5 and above) and the transport (layer 4). NDIS and ODI are interfaces between the media (layer 2) and the network protocol (layer 3).\\r\\nInterface standards, except for the physical layer to media, are approximate implementations of OSI service specifications.\\r\\nThe design of protocols in the TCP/IP model of the Internet does not concern itself with strict hierarchical encapsulation and layering.[16] RFC 3439 contains a section entitled \\"Layering considered harmful\\".[17] TCP/IP does recognize four broad layers of functionality which are derived from the operating scope of their contained protocols: the scope of the software application; the end-to-end transport connection; the internetworking range; and the scope of the direct links to other nodes on the local network.[18]\\r\\nDespite using a different concept for layering than the OSI model, these layers are often compared with the OSI layering scheme in the following way:\\r\\nThese comparisons are based on the original seven-layer protocol model as defined in ISO 7498, rather than refinements in such things as the internal organization of the network layer document.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe presumably strict layering of the OSI model as it is usually described does not present contradictions in TCP/IP, as it is permissible that protocol usage does not follow the hierarchy implied in a layered model. Such examples exist in some routing protocols (for example OSPF), or in the description of tunneling protocols, which provide a link layer for an application, although the tunnel host protocol might well be a transport or even an application-layer protocol in its own right.[citation needed]","input":"How many layers are there in osi networking model?"},{"output":"after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated","context":"Local Monograph\\r\\nLidocaine, also known as xylocaine and lignocaine, is a medication used to numb tissue in a specific area.[4] It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and to perform nerve blocks.[3][4] Lidocaine mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) is available to allow larger doses for numbing, to decrease bleeding, and to make the numbing effect last longer.[4] When used as an injectable, it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours.[4][5] Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area.[4]\\r\\nCommon side effects with intravenous use include sleepiness, muscle twitching, confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting.[3] It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate.[3] There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage.[4] It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy.[3] A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems.[3] It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine.[4] Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type.[3] Lidocaine works by blocking sodium channels and thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart.[3] When used locally as a numbing agent, local neurons cannot signal the brain.[4]\\r\\nLidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948.[6] It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[7] It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive.[4][8] The wholesale cost in the developing world in 2014 was US$0.45 to $1.05 wholesale per 20ml vial of medication.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful.[10] Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.\\r\\nThere is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain.[11][12]\\r\\nAs a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation.[13]\\r\\nLidocaine is also the most important class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventative dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.[14]\\r\\nA 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures.[15]\\r\\nInhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for patients who have to be intubated, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.[16]\\r\\nLidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge.[17][18]\\r\\nFor gastritis, drinking viscous lidocaine may help with the pain.[19]\\r\\nRelative insensitivity to lidocaine is genetic. In hypokalemic sensory overstimulation, relative insensitivity to lidocaine has been described in people who also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.[20] In dental anaesthesia, a relative insensitivity to lidocaine can occur for anatomical reasons due to unexpected positions of nerves. Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are insensitive to lidocaine.[21]\\r\\nLidocaine, usually in the form of lignocaine hydrochloride, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion.[22]\\r\\nLidocaine hydrochloride 2% epinephrine 1:80,000 solution for injection in a cartridge\\r\\nLidocaine hydrochloride 1% solution for injection\\r\\nTopical lidocaine spray\\r\\n2% viscous lidocaine\\r\\nAdverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur.[23] Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly result in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects ÿ CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by system are:\\r\\nADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to toxic effects from systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (3?mg/min). Common ADRs include: headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.[24]\\r\\nIt is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers and toes.[25] While concerns of tissue death if used in these areas have been raised evidence does not support these concerns.[25]\\r\\nAny drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely contraindicated, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.[26]\\r\\nAbsolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include:\\r\\nExercise caution in patients with any of these:\\r\\nOverdoses with lidocaine can be a result of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations.[32] Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace than it was in the past.[33]\\r\\nLidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for signal propagation.[34] With sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain, but by stopping them before they begin. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other modalities of neuron signaling.\\r\\nThe same principle applies for this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.[35]\\r\\nWhen used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours.[4][5] Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker.[36] The volume of distribution is 1.1?L/kg to 2.1?L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%.\\r\\nThe elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90?min to 120?min in most patients. This may be prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment (average 343?min) or congestive heart failure (average 136?min).[37] Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).[38]\\r\\nLidocaine, the first amino amideÿtype local anesthetic, was first synthesized under the name 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils L?fgren in 1943.[39][40][41] His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself.[39] It was first marketed in 1949.\\r\\nLidocaine is the INN and BAN while lignocaine is the AAN and former BAN.\\r\\nXylocaine is a brandname.\\r\\nLidocaine is not currently listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as an illegal substance.[42] It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin.[43] It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders.[44]\\r\\nLidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent.[45][46] Cocaine numbs the gums when applied. Lidocaine causes a similar numbing sensation when applied to the gums and is sometimes used as an adulterant in cocaine. This gives the user the impression of high-quality cocaine when in actuality, the user is receiving a diluted product. [47]\\r\\nIt is a component of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and chloroquine used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs.[49][50]","input":"When is lidocaine used to treat ventricular tachycardia?"},{"output":"The Need for Speed","context":"Need for Speed, also known by its initials NFS, is a racing video game franchise created by Electronic Arts and currently developed by Ghost Games. The series centers around illicit street racing and in general tasks players to complete various types of races while evading the local law enforcement in police pursuits. The series released its first title, The Need for Speed in 1994. Since Need for Speed: High Stakes, the series has also integrated car body customization into gameplay.\\r\\nNeed for Speed has been critically well received. It is one of the most successful video game franchises of all time, selling over 150 million copies of games.[1] Due to its strong sales, the franchise has expanded into other forms of media including a film adaptation and licensed Hot Wheels toys.[2]\\r\\nThe series has been overseen and had games developed by multiple notable teams over the years including EA Black Box and Criterion Games, the creators of the Burnout franchise.[3] In August 2013, following the downsizing of Criterion Games, it was announced that Swedish developer Ghost Games would gain control of the Need for Speed racing franchise and oversee future development of the main series.[4][5] At the time, 80% of Ghost Games' work force consisted of former Criterion Games employees.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all of the games in the NFS series employ the same fundamental rules and similar mechanics: the player controls a race car in a variety of races, the goal being to win the race. In the tournament/career mode, the player must win a series of races in order to unlock vehicles and tracks. Before each race, the player chooses a vehicle, and has the option of selecting either an automatic or manual transmission. All games in the series have some form of multiplayer mode allowing players to race one another via a split screen, a LAN or the Internet.\\r\\nAlthough the games share the same name, their tone and focus can vary significantly. For example, in some games the cars can suffer mechanical and visual damage, while in other games the cars cannot be damaged at all; in some games the software simulates real-car behavior (physics), while in others there are more forgiving physics.\\r\\nWith the release of Need for Speed: Underground, the series shifted from racing sports cars on scenic point-to-point tracks to an import/tuner subculture involving street racing in an urban setting. To date, this theme has remained prevalent in most of the following games.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Shift and its sequel took a simulator approach to racing, featuring closed-circuit racing on real tracks like the Nrburgring and the Laguna Seca, and fictional street circuits in cities like London and Chicago. The car lists include a combination of exotics, sports cars, and tuners in addition to special race cars.\\r\\nMost of the games in the franchise include police pursuits in some form or other. In some of the games featuring police pursuit, the player can play as either the felon or the cop.[6] The concepts of drifting and dragging were introduced in Need for Speed: Underground. These new mechanics are included in the tournament/career mode aside from the regular street races. In drift races, the player must defeat other racers by totaling the most points, earned by the length and timing of the drift made by the player's vehicle.[7] In drag races, the player must finish first to win the race, though if the player crashes into an obstacle, the race ends.[7]\\r\\nThe concept of car tuning evolved with each new game, from focusing mainly on the mechanics of the car to including how the car looks. Each game has car tuning which can set options for items like ABS, traction control, or downforce, or for upgrading parts like the engine or gearbox. Visual tuning of the player's car becomes important in tournament/career mode after the release of Need for Speed: Underground 2, when the appearance is rated from zero to ten points. When a car attains a high enough visual rating, the vehicle is eligible to be on the cover of a fictional magazine.[8]\\r\\nLike all racing games, the Need for Speed series features a list of cars, modeled and named after actual cars. Cars in the franchise are divided into four categories: exotic cars, muscle cars, tuners, and special vehicles.[9] Exotic cars feature high performance, expensive cars like the Lamborghini Murcilago, Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, Chevrolet Corvette and the Ford GT; muscle cars refer to the Ford Mustang, Dodge Challenger and the Chevrolet Camaro; while tuner cars are cars like the Nissan Skyline and the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. The special vehicles are civilian and police cars that are available for use in some games, such as the Ford Crown Victoria in Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and garbage trucks, fire engines and taxis in Need for Speed: Carbon.[9]\\r\\nOriginally the series took place in international settings, such as race tracks in Australia, Europe, and Africa.[10] Beginning with Underground, the series has taken place in fictional metropolitan cities.[11] The first game featured traffic on \\"head to head\\" mode, while later games traffic can be toggled on and off, and starting with Underground, traffic is a fixed obstacle.[11] Most of the recent Need for Speed games are set in fictional locations of our world, in a number of different time periods. These include, but are not limited to, Bayview, Rockport, Seacrest County, Fairhaven City and Ventura Bay.\\r\\nThe Need for Speed series was originally developed by Distinctive Software, a video game studio based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Prior to Electronic Arts' purchase of the company in 1991, it had created popular racing games such as Stunts and Test Drive II: The Duel. After the purchase, the company was renamed Electronic Arts (EA) Canada. The company capitalized on its experience in the domain by developing the Need for Speed series in late 1992.[12] EA Canada continued to develop and expand the Need for Speed franchise up to 2002, when another Vancouver-based gaming company, named Black Box Games, was contracted to continue the series with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2.[13] EA Black Box has been the primary series developer on a yearly cycle from 2002-08. In 2009, EA brought in Slightly Mad Studios, due to sagging sales, and they released Need for Speed: Shift, and EA's own UK-based company Criterion Games came with Hot Pursuit in 2010. In 2011, Slightly Mad Studios released a sequel to Shift, Shift 2: Unleashed and EA Black Box released Need for Speed: The Run.\\r\\nIn 2010, EA introduced a social platform, titled Autolog, for Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and future games in the series. Autolog provides social features for Need for Speed games via a mobile app and website; it allows players to track game progress, view leaderboards, share screenshots with friends, and more.[14]\\r\\nAt E3 2012, Criterion Games vice president Alex Ward announced that random developers would no longer be developing NFS titles. Ward wouldn't confirm that all Need for Speed games in the future would be developed entirely by Criterion, but he did say the studio would have \\"strong involvement\\" in them, and would have control over which NFS titles would be released in the future.[3][15]\\r\\nDuring August 2013, it was announced that Criterion would be restructured and downsized, while Ghost Games would spearhead all future development of the series.[3]\\r\\nThere have been 23 games released in the Need for Speed series.\\r\\n^1 The PSP version was called Need for Speed: Underground Rivals, it was released in 2005.\\r\\n^2 This game was not released on the PS3, but the PS2 version is available as a digital download on PlayStation Network as of 2012.\\r\\n^3 The iOS version was canceled due to low sales of The Run.\\r\\nThe original Need for Speed was released for 3DO in 1994 with versions released for the PC (DOS) (1995), PlayStation and Saturn (1996) following shortly afterwards. The Need for Speed and its Special Edition were the only games in the series to support DOS, with subsequent releases for the PC run only within Windows.\\r\\nThe first installment of The Need for Speed was the only serious attempt by the series to provide a realistic simulation of car handling elements through the direct collaboration of Staff members from Road & Track. Electronic Arts left the handling dynamics tuning with the automotive magazine's seasoned drivers to match vehicle behavior including realistic over and understeer that remains impressive decades later, as well as sounds made by the vehicles' gear control levers and other functions. The game contained vehicle data with spoken commentary, several \\"magazine style\\" images of each car, and short video-clips highlighting the vehicles set to music.\\r\\nMost cars and tracks are available at the beginning of the game, and the objective is to unlock the remaining locked content by winning tournaments. This version featured chases by police cars, a popular theme throughout the series.\\r\\nAnother version, called The Need for Speed: Special Edition, was released only for the PC in 1996. It featured support for DirectX 2 and TCP/IP networking, two new tracks, but dropped the ever-popular flip and go in favor of the more generic scene reset after an accident, a portents of the arcade style gaming that would dominate the series ever after.\\r\\nNeed for Speed II (NFS II) featured some rare and exotic vehicles, including the Ford Indigo concept vehicle, and featured country-themed tracks from North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The PlayStation port of NFS II was the first PlayStation game to take advantage of the NeGcon controller, and the Dual Analog and DualShock controllers as well. A new racing mode was also introduced, dubbed \\"Knockout\\", where the last racers to finish laps will be eliminated. In addition, track design was more open-ended; players could now \\"drive\\" off the asphalt, and cut across fields to take advantage of shortcuts. Need for Speed II: Special Edition includes one extra track, extra cars, and support for Glide.\\r\\nNeed for Speed III: Hot Pursuit added Hot Pursuit mode, where the player either attempted to outrun the police or be the cop, arresting speeders.\\r\\nNFS III took advantage of the multimedia capabilities by featuring audio commentary, picture slideshows and music videos. This game was the first in the series to allow the downloading of additional cars from the official website. As a result, modding communities sprang up to create vehicles. The PC version was also the first game in the series to support Direct 3D hardware.\\r\\nHigh Stakes (North American and Australian title), also known as Road Challenge (European and Brazilian title), Conduite en tat de libert (French title) and Brennender Asphalt (German title), was released in the summer of 1999.\\r\\nHigh Stakes introduced several new types of gameplay: High Stakes, Getaway, Time Trap, and Career. High Stakes was a racing mode; Getaway required the player to outrun numerous pursuing police vehicles; Time Trap was a time lap trial; and Career was a tournament mode which incorporated a monetary reward system. Another innovation was the introduction of damage models, where after a race the player is given the option to purchase repairs. The mode also allows players, for the first time, to upgrade cars.\\r\\nThe PlayStation version of the game, released some months before the PC version, featured improved gameplay. The AI in the game was more advanced: the five AIs known as Nemesis, Bullit, Frost, Ranger, and Chump featured different driving characteristics. In the PlayStation version, the McLaren F1 GTR was based on the 1997 Long Tail, while the PC version was based on the original 95/96 version.\\r\\nPorsche Unleashed (North America and Latin America title), Porsche 2000 (European title) or simply Porsche (in Germany) is different from the previous versions, because it featured only Porsches.\\r\\nThe vehicle handling in the PC version was said to be the most realistic in any NFS game, but like the PS1 version had very simplified arcade handling that fell woefully short of the Hallmark handling offered in the first game. The player had to win races to unlock cars in chronological order from 1950 to 2000. Porsche Unleashed also featured a Factory Driver mode, where the player had to test Porsches to move forward in the game, and did not feature a split screen mode.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2 was the debut NFS title from EA Black Box, and the first NFS for the sixth generation consoles. Different versions of the game were produced for each game platform; the Xbox, GameCube and PC versions were developed in EA Seattle, while the PS2 version was developed by Black Box Games in Vancouver.\\r\\nHot Pursuit 2 draws primarily from the gameplay and style of NFS III; its emphasis on evading the police and over-the-top tracks. Although the game allowed players to play as the police, the pursuit mode was less realistic than preceding versions of NFS; players merely needed to \\"tap\\" a speeder to arrest them, as opposed to using simulated police tactics to immobilize a speeding vehicle.\\r\\nThis was the first version since the start of the series not to feature an \\"in the driving seat\\" camera view, transitioning EA from realistic racing to arcade street racing. It was the last game in the series for the PC version to feature the split-screen two player mode introduced in Need for Speed II. For the multiplayer mode of the PC version, GameSpy's internet matchmaking system was used in place of Local Area Network (LAN) play. Hot Pursuit 2 was also the first NFS game to use songs sung by licensed artists under the EA Trax label.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Underground was developed by EA Black Box and released on November 17, 2003. This was the first NFS game to require Hardware Transform and Lighting in Graphics Cards. Most of the new elements in Underground became defining marks of later installments in the Need for Speed series.\\r\\nUnderground shifted from semi-professional racing and isolated circuits to the street racing style of other arcade racing series: all circuits became part of a single map, Olympic City, except for drifts. Underground introduced two new play modes (Drag and Drift) and more tuning options than in the earlier High Stakes. Underground was also the first game in the series to feature a story, told via pre-rendered videos.\\r\\nUnderground features tuner cars and has a wide variety of tuning options such as widebody kits, bumpers, spoilers, etc., as well as performance upgrades such as engines and nitrous. City street racing is the primary focus of the game.\\r\\nThere were no police in Underground and Underground 2, which drew criticism as police had been an important part of previous titles.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Underground 2, was developed by EA Black Box and released on November 15, 2004. A demo of the game was placed as a bonus in copies of the EA/Criterion collaboration Burnout 3: Takedown.\\r\\nIn Underground 2, the story mode continued, but there were new racing modes such as Underground Racing League and Street X, more tuning options, and a new method of selecting races. Also included was an \\"outrun\\" mode where a player can challenge random opponents on the road (similar to Tokyo Xtreme Racer). Underground 2 also introduced several SUVs, used to race against other SUVs. The most significant change vs. the original Underground was the introduction of its Open World (free roam) environments,[16] setting the tone for numerous NFS games to come. This was also the publisher's most marketed feature at launch. In addition, the game featured actresses/models Brooke Burke and Kelly Brook as in-game characters to help guide the player through the campaign.[17]\\r\\nThe customization features were significantly expanded on modifications which did not affect vehicle performance. Players were required to customize their car to a certain numerical value in order to be offered DVD and magazine covers, the only way to advance to higher game levels. The game featured more extensive product placement for companies with no connection to auto racing. This game also had extensive customization options in the form of suspension upgrades, nitrous systems and engine mods.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Underground Rivals was the first Need for Speed game released on the PlayStation Portable. Different from Need for Speed: Underground 2 as it had no free roam and the cars were very limited, it was released on February 24, 2005 in Japan, March 14, 2005 in North America, and September 1, 2005 in Europe. The title went Platinum in Europe on June 30, 2006.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Most Wanted was developed by EA Black Box, released on November 16, 2005, and was one of the first games released for the Xbox 360. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS. The PlayStation Portable port of Most Wanted is called Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0.\\r\\nPolice chases represent a significant body of the gameplay, and include the free-roaming aspect of Underground 2, but with less extensive vehicle customization features. The story mode is a different style from Underground, with CGI effects mixed with live action. The game featured the Blacklist, a crew consisting of 15 racers that the player must beat one-by-one to unlock parts, cars, tracks, and to complete career mode. The player had to meet certain requirements before they could take on the next Blacklist rival, such as races completed, milestones achieved, bounty earned, etc.\\r\\nA special Black Edition of Most Wanted was also released, featuring additional races, challenges, and a few bonus cars; it also included a behind-the-scenes DVD. Both versions were available for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo DS, and Windows-based PCs, while only the standard edition was available for GameCube and Xbox 360.\\r\\nMost Wanted had extremely positive reviews and received universal acclaim from reviewers in many gaming websites and magazines, praising the graphics, sound effects and general gameplay. With 16 million copies sold worldwide, it's the best-selling game in the franchise.[18] A game, also named Need for Speed: Most Wanted, was released in 2012 with British developer Criterion Games responsible for the development.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Carbon was developed by EA Black Box and released on October 31, 2006. It was the first NFS game for the PlayStation 3 and the Wii and the last NFS game for the Nintendo GameCube, the Game Boy Advance, and the Xbox. Carbon's handheld port is known as Need for Speed: Carbon ÿ Own the City. The Wii port lacked online, but made full use of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk.\\r\\nNFS: Carbon continued the story from Most Wanted, however, the game has far less emphasis on the police. Carbon saw the return of nighttime-only racing, with a selection of cars similar to that of Most Wanted. Carbon introduced a new feature wherein the player is allowed to form a \\"crew\\" that aids the player in races. Drift events returned to the series in Carbon.\\r\\nDrag racing was removed from the series, but a new type of race called \\"Canyon Duel\\" was added, where the closer the player is to the leader, the more points they accrue. If the player overtakes the leader and remains in front for 10 seconds, they win automatically. Another new feature is \\"Autosculpt\\", which allows players to custom-fabricate their own auto parts.\\r\\nThe Collector's Edition Featuring three new cars, ten specially tuned cars, six new races, and a bonus DVD with behind-the-scenes footage on the making of the game.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: ProStreet, developed by EA Black Box, was released in 2007. Key features of the game included realistic damage, a return to realistic racing, modeling, and burnouts.[19][20] The game lacked the free roam mode found in earlier releases, instead, all of the races were on closed race tracks that took place on organized race days. The game consisted of drag races, speed challenges (essentially sprint races and speed traps), grip races (circuit racing), and drift races.[citation needed]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Undercover, developed by EA Black Box, was released on November 18, 2008. The game had a significantly longer development cycle than previous games, taking 16 months to develop.[21] EA Games president Frank Gibeau stated that since sales of ProStreet didn't live up to EA's projections, the franchise would go back to its \\"roots\\". The game received lower scores on aggregate than Pro Street.\\r\\nThe game focused on tuning and police chases, featured over 50 cars, and took place in a fictional city called Tri City Bay. The player's role was as an undercover cop, trying to stop street racers. Containing live-action cutscenes which feature the actress Maggie Q, the game also featured a damage system where parts could break off after a crash.\\r\\nThe Collector's Edition for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 added another 5 new cars, twelve new circuits, and sprint and checkpoint track configurations. Also included were specially tuned versions of ten existing cars, plus 35 exclusive vinyls for adding a unique visual style.\\r\\nEA ported Undercover to various mobile devices. It was the last Need for Speed game for PlayStation 2.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Shift, developed by Slightly Mad Studios, was released on September 15, 2009. It features over 60 cars and 19 tracks, some of which are actual licensed tracks while others are fictional. Improved driving simulation was accompanied by an adaptive difficulty, while it reintroduced a cockpit view. NFS: Shift focused on racing simulation rather than the arcade racing of previous titles.\\r\\nNFS: Shift received better reviews than the prior 3 games in the series. The Special Edition contained a special tuned BMW M3 GT2, and an Elite Series track. Two items of downloadable content were released for the game.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Nitro is the first NFS game made exclusively for Nintendo DS and Wii, featuring arcade-style gameplay and targeting a casual audience. Nitro was released on November 3, 2009 in North America and in Europe on November 6, 2009. Need for Speed: Nitro was also available as a social multiplayer game on Facebook.[22]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Nitro-X (2010) was a newer installment for use with the DSi/XL and the 3DS system. Essentially the original release, it was updated with several updates: 18 licensed vehicles; new police units; custom tags; 16 updated tracks; a revised career mode; local multiplayer matches for up to 4 players; and new rewards and unlockables. The game was released as a digital download only, released on November 15, 2010 in North America and November 26, 2010 in Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: World was a free-to-play MMO racing game for Windows-based PCs.\\r\\nIt took on the gameplay style of Most Wanted and Carbon, focusing on illegal street racing, tuning and police chases, and adding classic MMO elements to the mix. World incorporated almost exact replicas of the cities of Rockport and Palmont, the cities of Most Wanted and Carbon respectively, into its map design. World was originally scheduled for an Asian release in the summer of 2009, however the game was not released at that time and it was released worldwide on July 27, 2010.[23][24] In October 2009, the game was in public beta-testing limited to residents of Taiwan.\\r\\nThe beta was launched on June 2, 2010. The game was released to players who had the starter pack on July 20, 2010 and to others on July 27, 2010. Previously, the players who did not purchase the Starter Pack were not able to progress further from level 10; the level cap for those players has since been removed on September 8, 2010, allowing all players' progression and availability. Players were limited to 60 levels only. It has a garage of 150+ cars.[25]\\r\\nOn April 15, 2015, it was announced that Need for Speed World would be closing its servers on July 14, 2015. They soon after removed the ability to create new accounts for the game and began winding down their support for it. Since the announcement, there have been several \\"end of the world\\" promotions and in game events but many of the players have since moved on.[26]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Hot Pursuit was developed by British games developer Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts on November 16, 2010.[27] It focuses on racing and police chases rather than car customization. The game won many awards at the E3 2010, including \\"Best Racing Game\\", becoming the first game in the NFS series since the original Hot Pursuit to win an E3 award.\\r\\nThere were over 60 cars, most available to both racers and cops, but a few were exclusive to either side.[28] Unlike previous NFS titles, there was no customization, and the game takes place in a fictional rural area called Seacrest County, which the \\"free roam\\" feature lets you explore. Hot Pursuit allows play as either police or racer.\\r\\nThe game also features many weapons, with some exclusive to the cops or racers. The biggest feature introduced was the Need for Speed Autolog, which tracked player progressions and recommended events to play. In addition to its statistical system, Autolog also features Facebook-like speedwalls where players can post their comments and photos while in the game. Hot Pursuit has received some of the best reviews of the series.\\r\\nThe Limited Edition gives players exclusive access to the Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione and Ford Shelby GT500. Various downloadable content was released for the game.\\r\\nThe sequel to Need for Speed: Shift, Shift 2: Unleashed was developed by Slightly Mad Studios, and released on March 29, 2011. Shift 2 includes the Autolog feature introduced in Hot Pursuit.[29] It also includes features such as night racing, an in-helmet camera, and a more in-depth career mode. Shift 2 features more than 140 vehicles available for racing and tuning, a smaller number compared with other racing games such as Forza Motorsport 3 and Gran Turismo 5. There are also 40 real-world locations including Bathurst, Spa-Francorchamps and Suzuka as well as fictional circuits.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Limited Edition features 3 unlocked cars, and an additional 37 career race events.[30] Two downloadable contents were released for Shift 2.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: The Run was developed by EA Black Box, and released on November 15, 2011. The game continued the street-racing gameplay of Black Box's previous titles, with a story based on a race across the United States from San Francisco to New York.\\r\\nThe game featured quick time events with the player, for the first time in NFS history, exiting their car and traveling on foot. The Run was powered by DICE's Frostbite 2 engine, making the game the first non-shooter and one of the first console titles to use the engine. Additionally, the NFS Autolog was also used in the game.\\r\\nThe Run employs a large range of real-world vehicles, which can be altered with visual upgrades. An XP (Experience points) system is used for unlocking cars and events. The Limited Edition features three exclusive cars and five exclusive challenges with bonus rewards and achievements.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Most Wanted was developed by British games developer Criterion Games, and released on October 30, 2012. The game picked up on the Most Wanted IP, as opposed to the Hot Pursuit extension.[31] This was the first game made subsequent to Criterion Games taking over the NFS series from Black Box.\\r\\nIt features open world racing, and most of the cars in the game are available from the start, hidden in different locations.[32] It also features a blacklist of 10 instead of 15, and there is no story or visual customization for the game. It is powered by Autolog 2.0. Performance upgrades are available for all the cars in the game, such as chassis, tires, nitrous, and bodywork.[33] Milestones and achievements are unlocked through a variety of ways, e.g. completion of races and breaking through billboards.\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Rivals was developed by Ghost Games (formerly EA Gothenburg) in association with Criterion Games, and was released on November 15, 2013 for the PlayStation 4,[34] on November 19, 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360[34] and on November 22, 2013 for the Xbox One.[34] It runs on DICE's Frostbite 3 Engine. It has the same basic concept as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, but with new features like the AllDrive system, and several pursuit techs.\\r\\nOn May 21, 2015, EA and Ghost Games revealed Need for Speed, a full reboot of the franchise. The game was released on November 3, 2015 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with a release for Microsoft Windows (via Origin) in 2016. More information on the game was revealed during the EA press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 on June 15, 2015. A new trailer was released and a short gameplay demo was shown.[35] Beta released on PS4 and Xbox One. PC version was released on 15 March 2016 via Origin in two different editions. The Standard Edition is the base edition, whereas the Deluxe Edition has the styling pack, performance pack, tricked-out starter car, exclusive wraps, unique identifying stickers, VIP icons and lifetime discount on all items using the in-game currency.[36]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: No Limits was released in 2015 for iOS and Android, and a mobile installment in the Need for Speed video game series, developed by Firemonkeys Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is the franchise's first original title made exclusively for mobile devices, unlike past mobile games in the series that were simply adaptations of various Need for Speed games.\\r\\nEA and Ghost Games announced Need for Speed Payback in June 2017, and is scheduled for release on November 10, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.[37] The game will be playable offline unlike previous title. Revealed at EA press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017 from June 10ÿ12, 2017.[38]\\r\\nNeed for Speed: Edge is an upcoming free-to-play MMO racing game which is currently in development by EA Spearhead (formerly EA Korea) and published by Nexon from South Korea and Tencent Interactive Entertainment (known as Need for Speed Online) from China. It is the third free-to-play game in the franchise overall, also the only free-to-play racing game that runs on Frostbite 3 game engine. It is based on the 2013 title, Need for Speed Rivals.[39]\\r\\nThere are three games which are associated with, but not part of, the Need for Speed series.\\r\\nWhen V-Rally was released in 1997, it was developed by Eden Studios, and had no connection with the Need for Speed games. Electronic Arts acquired the rights to publish the PlayStation version of the game in the United States in order to help sales of the game, due to the fact that rally racing held little support in the U.S.[citation needed] The game was not originally intended to be part of the Need for Speed series; neither the game's development was done by Electronic Arts Canada (which at the time was the primary developer of the Need for Speed series), nor was it developed in as association with Electronic Arts in any way. Later versions of the game were solely published by Infogrames and were released under their original names.\\r\\nMuch like with the original V-Rally, EA purchased the rights to publish the PlayStation version of V-Rally 2. Infogrames published the Dreamcast version of the game in America as Test Drive: V-Rally.\\r\\nOriginally conceived as part of the Need for Speed series under the title Need for Speed: Motor City,[40] all single player elements were discarded in favor of an online-only model. The result, Motor City Online was a racing MMO game released by EA on October 29, 2001. The point of the game was to buy classic cars, tune them, and race them against other players. The game went offline less than two years later to enable EA to focus on The Sims Online. Later, EA, would develop a new online racing game, called Need for Speed: World.[41]\\r\\nEA worked with DreamWorks Studios to create a film version of Need for Speed starring Aaron Paul as Tobey Marshall, a mechanic and street racer who was framed by a wealthy business associate.[211][212] The movie released on March 14, 2014, and despite receiving negative reviews ended up grossing over $200 million at the worldwide box office. In April 2015, it was reported that a sequel would be produced by China Movie Channel, Jiaflix, and 1905.com in association with EA Games.[213][214]","input":"What was the first need for speed game?"},{"output":"Dian Fossey","context":"Dian Fossey (/da???n ?f?si/; January 16, 1932 ÿ c. December 26, 1985) was an American primatologist and conservationist known for undertaking an extensive study of mountain gorilla groups over a period of 18 years. She studied them daily in the mountain forests of Rwanda, initially encouraged to work there by anthropologist Louis Leakey. Her 1983 book, Gorillas in the Mist, combines her scientific study of the gorillas at Karisoke Research Center with her own personal story. It was adapted into a 1988 film of the same name.[1] Fossey was brutally murdered in her cabin at a remote camp in Rwanda in December 1985.\\r\\nCalled one of the foremost primatologists in the world, Fossey, along with Jane Goodall and Birut? Galdikas, were the so-called Trimates, a group of three prominent researchers on primates (Fossey on gorillas; Goodall on common chimpanzees; and Galdikas on orangutans) sent by Leakey to study great apes in their natural environments.[2][3]\\r\\nDuring her time in Rwanda, she actively supported conservation efforts and strongly opposed poaching and tourism in wildlife habitats. It has been theorized that her murder in 1985 was linked to her conservation efforts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFossey was born in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Kathryn \\"Kitty\\" (ne Kidd), a fashion model, and George E. Fossey III, an insurance agent.[1] Her parents divorced when she was six.[4] Her mother remarried the following year, to businessman Richard Price. Her father tried to keep in full contact, but her mother discouraged it, and all contact was subsequently lost.[5] Fossey's stepfather, Richard Price, never treated her as his own child. He would not allow Fossey to sit at the dining room table with him or her mother during dinner meals.[6] A man adhering to strict discipline, Richard Price offered Fossey little to no emotional support.[7] Struggling with personal insecurity, Fossey turned to animals as a way to gain acceptance.[8] Her love for animals began with her first pet goldfish and continued throughout her entire life.[6] At age six, she began horse riding, earning a letter from her school; by her graduation in 1954, Fossey had established herself as an equestrienne.\\r\\nEducated at Lowell High School, following the guidance of her stepfather she enrolled in a business course at the College of Marin. However, spending her summer on a ranch in Montana at age 19 rekindled her love of animals, and she enrolled in a pre-veterinary course in biology at the University of California, Davis. In defiance to her stepfather's wishes that she attend a business school, Dian wanted to spend her professional life working with animals. As a consequence, Dian's parents failed to give her any substantial amount of financial support throughout her adult life.[6] She supported herself by working as a clerk at White Front (a department store), doing other clerking and laboratory work, and laboring as a machinist in a factory.\\r\\nAlthough Fossey had always been an exemplary student, she had difficulties with basic sciences including chemistry and physics, and failed her second year of the program. She transferred to San Jose State College where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta sorority to study occupational therapy, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1954.[9] Initially following her college major, Fossey began a career in occupational therapy. She interned at various hospitals in California and worked with tuberculosis patients.[10] Fossey was originally a prizewinning equestrian, which drew her to Kentucky in 1955, and a year later took a job as an occupational therapist at the Kosair Crippled Children's Hospital in Louisville.[11]\\r\\nHer shy and reserved personality allowed her to work well with the children at the hospital.[12] Fossey became close with her coworker Mary White \\"Gaynee\\" Henry, secretary to the hospital's chief administrator and the wife of one of the doctors, Michael J. Henry. The Henrys invited Fossey to join them on their family farm, where she worked with livestock on a daily basis and also experienced an inclusive family atmosphere that had been missing for most of her life.[5][13] During her free time she would pursue her love of horses.[14]\\r\\nFossey turned down an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour due to lack of finances,[5] but in 1963 she borrowed $8,000 (one year's salary), took out her life savings[15] and went on a seven-week visit to Africa.[4] In September 1963, she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya.[10] While there, she met actor William Holden, owner of Treetops Hotel,[4] who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander.[4] Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rhodesia. Alexander's route included visits to Tsavo, Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of Manyara, famous for attracting giant flocks of flamingos; and the Ngorongoro Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.[10] The final two sites for her visit were Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (the archeological site of Louis and Mary Leakey); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist George Schaller had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for hominid fossils. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of Jane Goodall and the importance of long-term research of the great apes.[10] Although she had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,[10] by October 16, Fossey was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in Uganda, the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.[10] After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in The Courier-Journal newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.[4][10]\\r\\nWhen Leakey made an appearance in Louisville while on a nationwide lecture tour, Fossey took the color supplements that had appeared about her African trip in The Courier-Journal to show to Leakey, who remembered her and her interest in mountain gorillas. Three years after the original safari, Leakey suggested that Fossey could undertake a long-term study of the gorillas in the same manner as Jane Goodall had with chimpanzees in Tanzania.[6] Leakey lined up funding for Fossey to research mountain gorillas, and Fossey left her job to relocate to Africa.[16]\\r\\nAfter studying Swahili and auditing a class on primatology (the scientific study of primates) during the eight months it took to get her visa and funding, Fossey arrived in Nairobi in December 1966. With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped Land Rover which she named \\"Lily\\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the Gombe Stream Research Centre to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.[10] Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the Virunga Mountains, Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.[17] Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \\"Lily\\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.[10]\\r\\nFossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.[17] She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.[6] Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \\"noseprints\\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.[10]\\r\\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the Belgian Congo until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Joseph-Dsir Mobutu, by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the Congo Crisis. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the Kivu Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was interned at Rumangabo for two weeks. Fossey eventually escaped through bribery to Walter Baumg?rtel's Travellers Rest Hotel in Kisoro, where her escort was arrested by the Ugandan military.[10][18] Advised by the Ugandan authorities not to return to Congo, after meeting Leakey in Nairobi, Fossey agreed with him against US Embassy advice to restart her study on the Rwandan side of the Virungas.[10] In Rwanda, Fossey had met local American expatriate Rosamond Carr, who introduced her to Belgian local Alyette DeMunck; DeMunck had a local's knowledge of Rwanda and offered to find Fossey a suitable site for study.[10]\\r\\nOn September 24, 1967, Fossey founded the Karisoke Research Center, a remote rainforest camp nestled in Ruhengeri province in the saddle of two volcanoes. For the research center's name, Fossey used \\"Kari\\" for the first four letters of Mount Karisimbi that overlooked her camp from the south, and \\"soke\\" for the last four letters of Mount Bisoke, the slopes of which rose to the north, directly behind camp.[10] Established 3,000 metres (9,800?ft) up Mount Bisoke, the defined study area covered 25 square kilometres (9.7?sq?mi).[19] She became known by locals as Nyirmachabelli, or Nyiramacibiri, roughly translated as \\"The woman who lives alone on the mountain.\\"[20]\\r\\nUnlike the gorillas from the Congo side of the Virungas, the Karisoke area gorillas had never been partially habituated by Schaller's study; they knew humans only as poachers, and it took longer for Fossey to be able to study the Karisoke gorillas at a close distance.[21]\\r\\nMany research students left after not being able to handle the cold, dark, and extremely muddy conditions around Karisoke on the slopes of the Virunga Volcanoes, where paths usually had to be cut through six-foot-tall grass with a machete.[22]\\r\\nWhile hunting had been illegal in the national park of the Virunga Volcanoes in Rwanda since the 1920s, the law was rarely enforced by park conservators, who were often bribed by poachers and paid a salary less than Fossey's own African staff.[6] On three occasions, Fossey wrote that she witnessed the aftermath of the capture of infant gorillas at the behest of the park conservators for zoos; since gorillas will fight to the death to protect their young, the kidnappings would often result in up to 10 adult gorillas' deaths.[6] Through the Digit Fund, Fossey financed patrols to destroy poachers' traps in the Karisoke study area. In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.[23] The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.[23] In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's elephants for ivory and killed more than a dozen gorillas.[23]\\r\\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.[24]\\r\\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the zoo in Cologne, Germany. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.[25] The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the Virunga Volcanoes for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.[6] She viewed the holding of animals in \\"prison\\" (zoos) for the entertainment of people as unethical.[26]\\r\\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the silverback of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.[27] Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of gangrene, from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.[26][27]\\r\\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the World Wildlife Fund, African Wildlife Foundation, Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the Mount Sabyinyo area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.[6] The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and bushmeat hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \\"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \\"active conservation\\" or the international conservation groups' \\"theoretical conservation.\\"[24]\\r\\nFossey strongly opposed wildlife tourism, as gorillas are very susceptible to human anthroponotic diseases like influenza for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.[6] Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.[24]\\r\\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.[28]\\r\\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into pyrethrum farms. Thanks to her efforts, the park boundary was lowered from the 3,000-meter line to the 2,500-meter line.[6]\\r\\nSometime during the day on New Year's Eve 1977, Fossey's favorite gorilla, Digit, was killed by poachers. As the sentry of study group 4, he defended the group against six poachers and their dogs, who ran across the gorilla study group while checking antelope traplines. Digit took five spear wounds in ferocious self-defence and managed to kill one of the poachers' dogs, allowing the other 13 members of his group to escape.[29] Poachers sell gorilla hands as delicacies, magic charms or to make ash trays.[30] Digit was decapitated, and his hands cut off for ashtrays, for the price of $20. After his mutilated body was discovered by research assistant Ian Redmond, Fossey's group captured one of the killers. He revealed the names of his five accomplices, three of whom were later imprisoned.[31]\\r\\nFossey subsequently created the Digit Fund (now the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International in the USA)[32] to raise money for anti-poaching patrols.[26] In addition, a consortium of international gorilla funds arose to accept donations in light of Digit's death and increased attention on poaching.[27] Fossey mostly opposed the efforts of the international organizations, which she felt inefficiently directed their funds towards more equipment for Rwandan park officials, some of whom were alleged to have ordered some of the gorilla poachings in the first place.[27]\\r\\nThe deaths of some of her most studied gorillas caused Fossey to devote more of her attention to preventing poaching and less on scientific publishing and research.[27] Fossey became more intense in protecting the gorillas and began to employ more direct tactics: she and her staff cut animal traps almost as soon as they were set; frightened, captured and humiliated the poachers; held their cattle for ransom; burned their hunting camps and even mats from their houses.[4][better?source?needed] Fossey also constantly challenged the local officials to enforce the law and assist her.\\r\\nDuring her African safari, Fossey met Alexie Forrester, the brother of an African she had been dating in Louisville; Fossey and Forrester later became engaged. In her later years, Fossey became involved with National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell after a year of working together at Karisoke, with Campbell promising to leave his wife.[4] Eventually the pair grew apart through her dedication to the gorillas and Karisoke, along with his need to work further afield and his marriage. In 1970, during her time at Darwin College, Cambridge under the University of Cambridge to get her Ph.D., she discovered she was pregnant and had an abortion, later commenting that \\"you can't be a cover girl for National Geographic magazine and be pregnant.\\" Nevertheless, she graduated with a Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology in 1976.[4][not in citation given] Fossey had other relationships throughout the years and always had a love for children.[3] Since Fossey would rescue any abused or abandoned animal she saw in Africa or near Karisoke, she acquired a menagerie in the camp, including a monkey who lived in her cabin, Kima, and a dog, Cindy. Fossey held Christmas parties every year for her researchers, staffers, and their families, and she developed a genuine friendship with Jane Goodall.[33]\\r\\nFossey had been plagued by lung problems from an early age, and later in her life, she suffered from advanced emphysema brought on by years of heavy cigarette smoking.[34][35] As the debilitating disease progressedfurther aggravated by the high mountain altitude and damp climateFossey found it increasingly difficult to conduct field research, frequently suffering from shortness of breath and requiring the help of an oxygen tank when climbing or hiking long distances.[36]\\r\\nIn the early morning of December 27, 1985, Fossey was discovered murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at the far edge of the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda.[37] Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly 7 feet (2?m) away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin.[37] Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that \\"when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow.\\"[37] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor.[37] Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.[37][38]\\r\\nThe last entry in her diary read:[39]\\r\\nWhen you realize the value of all life, you dwell less on what is past and concentrate more on the preservation of the future.\\r\\nFossey is buried at Karisoke,[40][41] in a site that she herself had constructed for her deceased gorilla friends. She was buried in the gorilla graveyard next to Digit, and near many gorillas killed by poachers. Memorial services were also held in New York, Washington, and California.[42]\\r\\nA will purporting to be Fossey's bequeathed all of her estate (including the proceeds from the film Gorillas in the Mist) to the Digit Fund to underwrite anti-poaching patrols. Fossey did not mention her family in the will, which was unsigned. Her mother, Hazel Fossey Price, challenged the will and was successful.[6] Supreme Court Justice Swartwood threw out the will and awarded the estate to her mother, including about $4.9 million in royalties from a recent book and upcoming movie, stating that the document \\"was simply a draft of her purported will and not a will at all.\\" Price said she was working on a project to preserve the work their daughter had done for the mountain gorillas in Rwanda, located in eastern central Africa south of Uganda.[43]\\r\\nAfter Fossey's death, her entire staff, including Rwelekana, a tracker she had fired months before, were arrested. All were later released except Rwelekana, who was later found dead in prison, supposedly having hanged himself.[6]\\r\\nRwandan courts later tried and convicted Wayne McGuire in absentia for her murder. McGuire had returned to the United States in July 1987[44], and because no extradition treaty exists between the U.S. and Rwanda, McGuire, whose guilt is still widely questioned, has not served his sentence.[6]\\r\\nFollowing his return to the U.S., McGuire gave a brief statement at a news conference in Century City, Los Angeles, saying Fossey had been his \\"friend and mentor\\", calling her death \\"tragic\\" and the charges \\"outrageous\\".[45] Thereafter, McGuire was largely under the radar until 2005, when news broke that he had been accepted for a job with the Health and Human Services division of the State of Nebraska. The job offer was revoked upon discovery of his relation to the Fossey case.[46]\\r\\nSeveral subsequent books, including Farley Mowat's biography of Fossey, Woman in the Mists (New York, NY: Warner Books, 1987), have suggested alternate theories regarding her murder including intimations that she may have been killed by financial interests linked to tourism or illicit trade.\\r\\nFossey was reported to have captured and held Rwandans whom she suspected of poaching, stripped and then beaten them with stinging nettles.[47] After her murder, Fossey's National Geographic editor, Mary Smith, told Shlachter that on visits to the United States, Fossey would \\"load up on firecrackers, cheap toys and magic tricks as part of her method to mystify the (Africans) -- hold them at bay.\\"[48]\\r\\nWriting in The Wall Street Journal in 2002, Tunku Varadarajan described Fossey at the end of her life as colorful, controversial, and \\"a racist alcoholic who regarded her gorillas as better than the African people who lived around them.\\"[4][49]\\r\\nFossey made discoveries about gorillas including how females transfer from group to group over the decades, gorilla vocalization, hierarchies and social relationships among groups, rare infanticide, gorilla diet, and how gorillas recycle nutrients.[50] Fossey's research was funded by the Wilkie Foundation and the Leakey Home, with primary funding from the National Geographic Society.[51]\\r\\nBy 1980, Fossey, who had obtained her PhD at Cambridge University in the UK, was recognized as the world's leading authority on the physiology and behavior of mountain gorillas, defining gorillas as being \\"dignified, highly social, gentle giants, with individual personalities, and strong family relationships.\\"[5]\\r\\nFossey lectured as professor at Cornell University in 1981ÿ83. Her bestselling book Gorillas in the Mist was praised by Nikolaas Tinbergen, the Dutch ethologist and ornithologist who won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Her book remains the best-selling book about gorillas.[6]\\r\\nAfter her death, Fossey's Digit Fund in the U.S. was renamed the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International.[52] The Karisoke Research Center is operated by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, and continues the daily gorilla monitoring and protection that she started.\\r\\nShirley McGreal, a friend of Fossey,[53] continues to work for the protection of primates through the work of her International Primate Protection League (IPPL) one of the few wildlife organizations that according to Fossey effectively promotes \\"active conservation\\".\\r\\nBetween Fossey's death until the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Karisoke was directed by former students, some of whom had opposed her.[6] During the genocide and subsequent period of insecurity, the camp was completely looted and destroyed. Today only remnants remain of her cabin. During the civil war, the Virunga National Park was filled with refugees, and illegal logging destroyed vast areas.\\r\\nThe Rwandan people adapted the traditional household baby naming ceremony Kwita Izina to use with the gorillas.\\r\\nHer 82nd birthday in 2014 was marked by a Google Doodle appearing on its search homepage worldwide.[54]\\r\\nMowat's Virunga, whose British and U.S. editions are called Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa, was the first book-length biography of Fossey, and it serves as an insightful counterweight to the many omissions in Fossey's own story, being derived from Fossey's actual letters and entries in her journals. Harold Hayes's book The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film Gorillas in the Mist was based on Hayes' 1987 article in Life magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\\r\\nNo One Loved Gorillas More (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by National Geographic in the United States and Palazzo Editions in the United Kingdom. Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by Vanity Fair journalist Alex Shoumatoff called African Madness, in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people. The author also wrote a lengthy article titled \\"The Fatal Obsession of Dian Fossey\\".[55]\\r\\nThe Kentucky Opera Visions Program, in Louisville, has written an opera about Fossey, entitled Nyiramachabelli; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\\r\\nUniversal Studios bought the film rights to Gorillas in the Mist from Fossey in 1985, and Warner Bros. Studios bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by Rosamond Carr. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film Gorillas in the Mist, starring Sigourney Weaver. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer Bob Campbell. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by Bryan Brown) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\\r\\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, Adam Curtis uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of ecology, a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\\r\\n\\"Wild Kingdom: Reunion With the Gorillas\\" (1984), features footage of Dr. Fossey interacting with the great apes in the Virunga Mountains after being away from them for about three years. The documentary-style video is narrated by Dian Fossey and Marlin Perkins. She shares some of her observations and personal experiences, concerning the gorillas in the band.[56]","input":"Who was the woman who worked with gorillas?"},{"output":"approximately 1500 light years","context":"The Horsehead Nebula (also known as Barnard 33) is a dark nebula in the constellation Orion.[1] The nebula is located just to the south of the star Alnitak, which is farthest east on Orion's Belt, and is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. The nebula was first recorded in 1888 by Scottish astronomer Williamina Fleming on photographic plate B2312 taken at the Harvard College Observatory.[2] The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 1500 light years from Earth. It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of the shape of its swirling cloud of dark dust and gases, which bears some resemblance to a horse's head when viewed from Earth.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dark cloud of dust and gas is a region in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex where star formation is taking place. It is located in the constellation of Orion, which is prominent in the winter evening sky in the Northern Hemisphere and the summer evening sky in the Southern Hemisphere.

On September 5, 2017, Fertitta reached an agreement to buy the Houston Rockets for $2.2 billion.[9][10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFertitta was born and raised in Galveston, Texas, several generations after his family had emigrated to Texas from Sicily, Italy.[12] His father, Vic, owned a seafood restaurant on Galveston Island, and after school, Tilman would peel shrimp in his fathers restaurant.[13] Fertitta attended Texas Tech University and the University of Houston, studying business administration and hospitality management.[14] His first entrepreneurial experience involved selling and promoting Shaklee vitamins.[15]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Fertitta founded and ran a construction and development business, and developed his first major project, the Key Largo Hotel in Galveston.[16][17]\\r\\nFertitta was a partner in the first Landry's Restaurant, Landry's Seafood, which opened its doors in the Houston suburb of Katy, Texas, in 1980.[18] A year later, he helped open Willie G's Seafood & Steaks, a more upscale restaurant in Uptown Houston.[19]\\r\\nIn 1986, Fertitta gained controlling interests of both locations, and in 1988, became sole owner of Landry's Restaurants. In 1993, he took Landrys, Inc. public and the company grew quickly, adding concept after concept.[20]\\r\\nIn 2004, Fertitta was elected to the Texas Business Hall of Fame, becoming the second-youngest Texan to ever earn that distinction, behind only Michael Dell.[21][22]\\r\\nIn 2010, Fertitta, who already owned the majority of Landry's, Inc. stock, purchased all outstanding shares, becoming sole owner again. In 1993, the company was valued at approximately $30?million.[23]\\r\\nBy 2011, the company's value had skyrocketed to a value of more than $1.7?billion.[24] As of 2013, the company, under the leadership of Fertitta, owns and operates more than 500 restaurant/entertainment/gaming/hospitality locations. In total, Landry's, Inc. employs more than 50,000 people and controls $3.2?billion in assets.[18][25]\\r\\nHis portfolio includes: The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casinos; Morton's The Steakhouse; Rainforest Cafe; Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.; McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks; Saltgrass Steak House; Claim Jumper; Chart House; The Oceanaire; Mastro's Restaurants; Grotto Restaurants [26]and Vic & Anthony's Steakhouse.[27][28] In 2017 he acquired half of EMM group, owner of the Catch Restaurants [29].\\r\\nIn August 2017, it was revealed that the Oceanaire chain added a special tax to its bills in order to offset the minimum wage it pays employees. The chain and parent company were criticized by customers. The criticism and media coverage the led the company to remove the surcharge.[30][31]\\r\\nFertitta first built the Key Largo Hotel in Galveston, Texas to buy the rights to Landry's. After acquiring restaurants under the company, Fertitta started focusing more on the hospitality division of Landry's and acquired the San Luis Resort, Spa, & Conference Center in Galveston, Texas. He also partnered with the City of Galveston to build the conference center in 2004 inside the resort. Fertitta since acquired two additional hotels on the island, including the Holiday Inn On the Beach in 2003, and the Hilton Galveston Island Resort in 2004, which stands adjacent to his San Luis Resort. In 2015, Fertitta added the Villas at San Luis section of the hotel, which consists of ultra-luxury villas with direct access to both the beach and the hotel's pool.[32][33]\\r\\nLandry's first expanded to casinos in 2005 when it bought Golden Nugget Casinos, including locations in Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nevada. Since then, Landry's has opened casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Biloxi, Mississippi; and Lake Charles, Louisiana.\\r\\nThe Golden Nugget Atlantic City was previously called the Trump Marina. Fertitta purchased this casino from The Trump Organization after the casino went bankrupt. The Golden Nugget Lake Charles was bought after Fertitta found a license and resort land for sale from Pinnacle Entertainment, which owns the adjacent L'Auberge du Lac Resort. Fertitta stated he built the casino with the idea of having a casino in close proximity to his Houston hometown. After the first year proved the casino was successful, a new 300 room tower began construction on the property.\\r\\nIn addition to restaurants, hotels, and casinos, Landry's also owns amusement parks, aquariums, and the Kemah Boardwalk. Landry's, Inc. first acquired the Kemah Boardwalk in 1999. After acquiring the boardwalk, Fertitta added a few Landry's restaurants, and a few rides. In 2007, he added the Boardwalk Bullet which is a high speed wooden roller coaster. He also added the Boardwalk Fanta Sea, which is a luxury yacht cruise service where guests ride along the Galveston Bay.\\r\\nThe marina on the boardwalk is the largest concentration of boats and yachts in Greater Houston, as well as one of the largest in the nation. The boardwalk also includes an aquarium, which is under the same Landry's line of aquarium restaurants with locations in Houston, Denver, and Nashville. Travel + Leisure magazine named the Kemah boardwalk a top 10 American boardwalk.[34][35][36]\\r\\nIn 2000, Landry's acquired the land on the 400 block of Bagby in Downtown Houston. The deal came from a proposal of the City of Houston to redevelop the fire station. After redeveloping the building, the aquarium added the shark tank and restaurant before opening in 2003.[citation needed]\\r\\nFertitta redeveloped the pleasure pier in Galveston, Texas, after the pier had closed after damages by Hurricane Ike. The pier reopened in 2012 as the Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier. The redeveloped pier includes an amusement park, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company restaurant, as well as shops. [37]\\r\\nDuring the process of building the Houston Texans as an NFL team, Fertitta was one of the original investors in creating the franchise. He then lasted as a partner for the Texans owner Bob McNair until 2008. Fertitta then had to sell his interest in the franchise, as he owns Golden Nugget casinos as part of Landry's subsidiary. NFL rules state any staff member of a team can't be associated with gambling. Both Fertitta and McNair were disappointed, as Fertitta was part of the franchise since the beginning, yet the team needed to comply with NFL rules.[38]\\r\\nIn 2003, Fertitta bought the naming rights to the Crawford Boxes seating section of Minute Maid Park, calling it \\"Landry's Crawford Boxes\\". The term has become a commercial moniker during radio and television broadcasts. A Landry's sign is placed above the section, along with many of the company's subsidiaries. Traditionally, when a fan catches a home run, they are awarded a gift certificate to one of Landry's restaurants. Landry's promoters often visit the section and give away items such as T-shirts.[39]\\r\\nFertitta served as the director of the Houston Rockets in the 1990s, during which the team won two NBA titles during the 1993ÿ94 and 1994ÿ95 seasons.\\r\\nOn September 4, 2017, he agreed to purchase the Rockets from Leslie Alexander, pending league approval, for an NBA record $2.2 billion.[40] On October 6, 2017 Fertitta was approved by the NBA to own the Houston Rockets.[41] Fertitta paid for the Rockets by selling $1.415 billion worth of bonds.[42].

The poem was composed into song by Rabindranath Tagore.[1] The first two verses of the song were adopted as the National Song of India in October 1937 by Congress Working Committee prior to the end of colonial rule in August 1947.[2][3][4]\\r\\nAn ode to Durga as the Mother goddess, it was written in Bengali script in the novel Anandmath.[5] The title 'Vande Mataram' means \\"I praise thee, Mother\\" or \\"I praise to thee, Mother\\".[1][6] The \\"mother goddess\\" in later verses of the song has been interpreted as the motherland of the people ÿ Bangamata (Mother Bengal) and Bharat Mata (Mother India),[7][8] though the text does not mention this explicitly.\\r\\nIt played a vital role in the Indian independence movement, first sung in a political context by Rabindranath Tagore at the 1896 session of the Indian National Congress.[9] It became a popular marching song for political activism and Indian freedom movement in 1905.[1] Spiritual Indian nationalist and philosopher Sri Aurobindo referred it as \\"National Anthem of Bengal\\".[10] The song and the novel containing it was banned by the British government, but workers and general public defied the ban, many went to colonial prisons repeatedly for singing it, and the ban was overturned by the Indians after they gained independence from the colonial rule.[11][12]\\r\\nIn 1950 (after India's independence), the first two verses of the song were declared the \\"national song\\" of the Republic of India, distinct from the national anthem of India, Jana Gana Mana. The first two verses of the song are an abstract reference to mother and motherland, they do not mention any Hindu deity by name, unlike later verses that do explicitly mention goddesses such as Durga.[13][14] There is no time limit or circumstantial specification for the rendition of this song [unlike the national anthem Jana Gana Mana that specifies 52 seconds].[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root of the Sanskrit word Vande is Vand, which appears in Rigveda and other Vedic texts.[16][note 1] According to Monier Monier-Williams, depending on the context, vand means \\"to praise, celebrate, laud, extol, to show honour, do homage, salute respectfully\\", or \\"deferentially, venerate, worship, adore\\", or \\"to offer anything respectfully to\\".[16][17] The word Mtaram has Indo-European roots in mtr- (Sanskrit), mter (Greek), mater (Latin) which mean \\"mother\\".[18][19]\\r\\nThe first two verses of Vande Mataram adopted as the \\"National Song\\" read as follows:\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\n?????? ??????\\r\\n????????????\\r\\n????????????\\r\\n??????!\\r\\n????? ???????.\\r\\n\\r\\n?????-?????????\\r\\n??????-????????\\r\\n????????????\\r\\n???????????????,\\r\\n?????????\\r\\n??????????????\\r\\n?????? ?????\\r\\n????????\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\nb?nde mat?r?m\\r\\nsuj?lang suph?lang\\r\\nm?l?y?j?shit?lam\\r\\nsh?sy? shyam?lang\\r\\nmat?r?m\\r\\nb?nde mat?r?m\\r\\n\\r\\nshubhr? jyotsna\\r\\npul?kit? jaminim\\r\\nphull? kusumit?\\r\\ndrum?d?l?shobhinim\\r\\nsuhasining\\r\\nsum?dhur?bhashini\\r\\nsukh?dang b?r?dang\\r\\nmat?r?m\\r\\nb?nde mat?r?m\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\n??????? ???????\\r\\n???????????\\r\\n??????????? ???????\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????????????????\\r\\n??????????????\\r\\n????????????\\r\\n???????????????\\r\\n??????????\\r\\n?????? ????????\\r\\n??????? ??????\\r\\n????????\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\nvande mtaram\\r\\nsujal? suphal?\\r\\nmalayaja?ؐtalm\\r\\n?asya ?ymal?\\r\\nmtaram\\r\\nvande mtaram\\r\\n\\r\\n?ubhra jyotsnam\\r\\npulakita yminؐm\\r\\nphulla kusumita\\r\\ndrumadala?obhinؐm\\r\\nsuhsinؐ?\\r\\nsumadhura bh?i?ؐm\\r\\nsukhad? varad?\\r\\nmtaram\\r\\nvande mtaram\\r\\nThe complete original lyrics of the Vande Mataram song including the first two verses forming the National Song are as follows.[22]\\r\\n?????? ?????? ????????????\\r\\n???????????? ???????\\r\\n??????????????? ??????????????\\r\\n???????????? ???????????????\\r\\n????????? ?????? ????????\\r\\n?????? ????? ???????\\r\\n???? ???? ???? ????????? ?????\\r\\n???????? ???? ?????????????????\\r\\n?? ??? ?? ???? ????\\r\\n???????????? ????? ????????\\r\\n?????????????\\r\\n???? ?????? ???? ????, ???? ???? ???? ????\\r\\n???? ?? ????? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???? ?? ?????\\r\\n?????? ???? ?? ?????\\r\\n?????? ??????? ???? ??????? ????????\\r\\n???? ?? ?????? ??????????????\\r\\n???? ????? ????????\\r\\n???? ????????????? ??????\\r\\n????? ????? ????? ???????\\r\\n?????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ????? ????????? ???????? ????? ????? ???????\\r\\n????? ??????\\r\\n?????? ???????\\r\\n???????????\\r\\n?????????????\\r\\n???????\\r\\n\\r\\n?????????????????????????????\\r\\n???????????????????????????\\r\\n????????? ?????? ????????\\r\\n?????? ????? ???????? 1??\\r\\n\\r\\n????[22]-????-????-??-??-?????-?????\\r\\n????????-????-?????????-????????,\\r\\n???? ??? ?? ?? ????\\r\\n????????????\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\n?????????????\\r\\n???????? 2??\\r\\n\\r\\n???? ??????, ???? ????\\r\\n???? ????, ???? ????\\r\\n????? ?? ??????: ?????\\r\\n?????? ???? ?? ?????,\\r\\n????? ???? ?? ?????,\\r\\n?????? ??????? ??? ???????-?????????? 3??\\r\\n\\r\\n????? ?? ?????? ??????????????\\r\\n???? ?????????????\\r\\n???? ????????????,\\r\\n????? ??????\\r\\n????? ??????\\r\\n????? ???????\\r\\n?????? ???????\\r\\n???????? 4??\\r\\n\\r\\n????? ??????\\r\\n????????? ??????\\r\\n?????????? ????????\\r\\n????? ?????\\r\\n???????? 5??\\r\\nThe first translation of Bankim Chandra Chatterji's novel Anandamath, including the poem Vande Mataram, into English was by Nares Chandra Sen-Gupta, with the fifth edition published in 1906 titled \\"The Abbey of Bliss\\".[23]\\r\\nHere is the translation in prose of the above two stanzas rendered by Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. This has also been adopted by the Government of India's national portal.[9] The original Vande Mataram consists of six stanzas and the translation in prose for the complete poem by Shri Aurobindo appeared in Karmayogin, 20 November 1909.[24]\\r\\nMother, I praise thee!\\r\\nRich with thy hurrying streams,\\r\\nbright with orchard gleams,\\r\\nCool with thy winds of delight,\\r\\nDark fields waving Mother of might,\\r\\nMother free.\\r\\n\\r\\nGlory of moonlight dreams,\\r\\nOver thy branches and lordly streams,\\r\\nClad in thy blossoming trees,\\r\\nMother, giver of ease\\r\\nLaughing low and sweet!\\r\\nMother I kiss thy feet,\\r\\nSpeaker sweet and low!\\r\\nMother, to thee I praise thee.

[Verse 5]\\r\\nApart from the above prose translation, Sri Aurobindo also translated Vande Mataram into a verse form known as Mother, I praise thee!.[25] Sri Aurobindo commented on his English translation of the poem that \\"It is difficult to translate the National Song of India into verse in another language owing to its unique union of sweetness, simple directness and high poetic force.\\"[26]\\r\\nVande Mataram has inspired many Indian poets and has been translated into numerous Indian languages, such as Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Assamese, Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Punjabi and others.[27][note 2]\\r\\nBankim Chandra Chattopadhyay was one of the earliest graduates of the newly established Calcutta University. After his BA, he joined the British Indian government as a civil servant, becoming a District Magistrate and later a District Collector. Chattopadhyay was very interested in recent events in Indian and Bengali history, particularly the Revolt of 1857 and the previous century's Sanyasi Rebellion.[29] Around the same time, the administration was trying to promote \\"God Save the Queen\\" as the anthem for Indian subjects, which Indian nationalists disliked. It is generally believed that the concept of Vande Mataram came to Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay when he was still a government official, around 1876.[30] He wrote Vande Mataram at Chinsurah, there is a white colour house of Adhya Family near river Hooghly (near Mallik Ghat).[citation needed]\\r\\nChattopadhyay wrote the poem in a spontaneous session using words from Sanskrit and Bengali. The poem was published in Chattopadhyay's book Anandamatha (pronounced Anondom??h in Bengali) in 1882, which is set in the events of the Sannyasi Rebellion.[29][30] Jadunath Bhattacharya was asked to set a tune for this poem just after it was written.[30]\\r\\n\\"Vande Mataram\\" was the whole nation's thought and motto for independence [from British rule] during the Indian independence movement. Large rallies, fermenting initially in Bengal, in the major metropolis of Calcutta, would work themselves up into a patriotic fervour by shouting the slogan \\"Vande Mataram\\", or \\"I praise the Mother(land)!\\" The British, fearful of the potential danger of an incited Indian populace, banned the book and made the recital of the song a crime.[11] The British colonial government imprisoned many independence activists for disobeying the order, but workers and general public repeatedly violated the ban many times by gathering together before British officials and singing it.[11] Rabindranath Tagore sang Vande Mataram in 1896 at the Calcutta Congress Session held at Beadon Square. Dakhina Charan Sen sang it five years later in 1901 at another session of the Congress at Calcutta. Poet Sarala Devi Chaudurani sang the song in the Benares Congress Session in 1905. Lala Lajpat Rai started a journal called Vande Mataram from Lahore.[30] Hiralal Sen made India's first political film in 1905 which ended with the chant. Matangini Hazra's last words as she was shot to death by the Crown police were Vande Mataram.[31]\\r\\nIn 1907, Bhikaiji Cama (1861ÿ1936) created the first version of India's national flag (the Tiranga) in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1907. It had Vande Mataram written on it in the middle band.[32]\\r\\nA book titled Kranti Geetanjali published by Arya Printing Press (Lahore) and Bharatiya Press (Dehradun) in 1929 contains first two stanzas of this lyric on page 11[33] as Matra Vandana and a ghazal (Vande Mataram) composed by Bismil was also given on its back, i.e. page 12.[34] The book written by the famous martyr of Kakori Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil was proscribed by the then British government of India.\\r\\nMahatama Gandhi supported adoption and the singing of the Vande Mataram song. In January 1946, in a speech in Gauhati (Assam), he urged that \\"Jai Hind should not replace Vande-mataram\\". He reminded everyone present that Vande-mataram was being sung since the inception of the Congress. He supported the \\"Jai Hind\\" greeting, but remanded that this greeting should not be to the exclusion of Vande Mataram. Gandhi was concerned that those who discarded Vande Mataram given the tradition of sacrifice behind it, one day would discard Jai Hind also.[35][note 3]\\r\\nParts of the Vande Mataram was chosen as the \\"national song\\" in 1937 by the Indian National Congress as it pursued independence of India from the British colonial rule, after a committee consisting of Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Bose, Acharya Deva and Rabrindanath Tagore recommended the adoption.[37] The entire song was not selected by Hindu leaders in order to respect the sentiments of non-Hindus, and the gathering agreed that anyone should be free to sing an alternate \\"unobjectionable song\\" at a national gathering if they do not want to sing Vande Mataram because they find it \\"objectionable\\" for a personal reason.[37] According to the gathered leaders, including the Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore, though the first two stanzas began with an unexceptionable evocation of the beauty of the motherland, in later stanzas there are references to the Hindu goddess Durga. The Muslim League and Muhammad Ali Jinnah opposed the song. Thereafter, with the support of Mahatma Gandhi and Jawahar Lal Nehru, the Indian National Congress decided to adopt only the first two stanzas as the national song to be sung at public gatherings, and other verses that included references to Durga and Lakshmi were expunged.[2][38]\\r\\nRajendra Prasad, who was presiding the Constituent Assembly on 24 January 1950, made the following statement which was also adopted as the final decision on the issue:\\r\\n...The composition consisting of words and music known as Jana Gana Mana is the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations as the Government may authorise as occasion arises, and the song Vande Mataram, which has played a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honoured equally with Jana Gana Mana and shall have equal status with it. (Applause) I hope this will satisfy members.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of India has declared that there is no national song of India as per the Constitution.[39]\\r\\nThe poem has been set to a large number of tunes. The oldest surviving audio recordings date to 1907, and there have been more than a hundred different versions recorded throughout the 20th century. Many of these versions have employed traditional South Asian classical ragas. Versions of the song have been visualised on celluloid in a number of films, including Leader, Amar Asha, and Anand Math. It is widely believed that the tune set for All India Radio station version was composed by Ravi Shankar.[30] Hemant Kumar composed music for the song in the movie Anand Math in 1952 and this version of the Vande Mataram sung by Lata Mangeshkar became a cult success.[40] In 2002, BBC World Service conducted an international poll to choose ten most famous songs of all time. Around 7000 songs were selected from all over the world. Vande Mataram, from the movie Anand Math, was ranked second.[41] All India Radio's version and some other versions are in Desh raga.[42]\\r\\nIn July 2017, the Madras High Court ruled that the Vande Mataram shall be sung or played at least once a week in all schools, universities and other educational institutions of Tamil Nadu. The Court also ruled that the song should be played or sung in government offices and industrial facilities at least once a month.[43]\\r\\nVocals\\r\\nDebate","input":"When was vande mataram sung for the first time?"},{"output":"a red cross on a white background","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack,[note 1][2][3] or Union Flag, is the national flag of the United Kingdom. The flag also has an official or semi-official status in some other Commonwealth realms: for example, it is a ceremonial flag in Canada by parliamentary resolution, and known there as the Royal Union Flag.[4] Further, it is used as an official flag in some of the smaller British overseas territories. The Union Flag also appears in the canton (upper left-hand quarter) of the flags of several nations and territories that are former British possessions or dominions, as well as the state flag of Hawaii.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe claim that the term Union Jack properly refers only to naval usage has been disputed, following historical investigations by the Flag Institute in 2013.[5][6][note 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origins of the earlier flag of Great Britain date back to 1606. James VI of Scotland had inherited the English and Irish thrones in 1603 as James I, thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland, and Ireland in a personal union, although the three kingdoms remained separate states. On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the Saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes. King James also began to refer to a \\"Kingdom of Great Britaine\\", although the union remained a personal one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801.[8] The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of St George for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of St Andrew for Scotland (which two were united in the first Union Flag), and the red saltire of St Patrick to represent Ireland.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, the home country of Wales is not represented separately in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the invasion of Wales in 1282. Hence Wales as a home country today has no representation on the flag; it appears under the cross of St George, which represents the former Kingdom of England (which included Wales).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe terms Union Jack and Union Flag are both historically correct for describing the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom. Whether the term Union Jack applies only when used as a jack flag on a ship is a modern matter of debate.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Parliament of the United Kingdom:[10][11] \\"Until the early 17th century England and Scotland were two entirely independent kingdoms. This changed dramatically in 1603 on the death of Elizabeth I of England. Because the Queen died unmarried and childless, the English crown passed to the next available heir, her cousin James VI, King of Scotland.  England and Scotland now shared the same monarch under what was known as a union of the crowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1606, James VI gave orders for a British flag to be created which bore the combined crosses of St. George and of St. Andrew.  The result was the Union Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Flag Institute, a membership-run vexillological charity,[12] \\"the national flag of the United Kingdom, the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories is the Union Flag, which may also be called the Union Jack.\\"[13] The institute also notes: \\r\\nit is often stated that the Union Flag should only be described as the Union Jack when flown in the bows of a warship, but this is a relatively recent idea. From early in its life the Admiralty itself frequently referred to the flag as the Union Jack, whatever its use, and in 1902 an Admiralty circular announced that Their Lordships had decided that either name could be used officially. In 1908, a government minister stated, in response to a parliamentary question, that \\"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\\".[9][14]\\r\\n\\r\\n Notwithstanding Their Lordships' circular of 1902, by 1913 the Admiralty described the \\"Union Flag\\" and added in a foot note that 'A Jack is a Flag to be flown only on the \\"Jack\\" Staff'.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the authoritative A Complete Guide to Heraldry published in 1909 by Arthur Charles Fox-Davies uses the term \\"Union Jack\\".[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Union Flag\\" is used in King Charles I's 1634 proclamation:\\r\\n\\r\\n... none of Our Subjects, of any of Our Nations and Kingdoms shall from henceforth presume to carry the Union Flag in the Main top, or other part of any of their Ships (that is) St Georges cross and St Andrew's Cross joined together upon pain of Our high displeasure, but that the same Union Flag be still reserved as an ornament proper for Our own Ships and Ships in our immediate Service and Pay, and none other.\\"[17]\\r\\n and in King George III's proclamation of 1 January 1801 concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland:\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that the Union Flag shall be Azure, the Crosses Saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick Quarterly per Saltire, counterchanged Argent and Gules; the latter fimbriated of the Second, surmounted by the Cross of St. George of the Third, fimbriated as the Saltire?: ...[18]\\r\\nWhen the first flag representing Britain was introduced on the proclamation of King James I in 1606,[19] it became known simply as the \\"British flag\\" or the \\"flag of Britain\\". The royal proclamation gave no distinctive name to the new flag. The word \\"jack\\" was in use before 1600 to describe the maritime bow flag.[9] By 1627 a small Union Jack was commonly flown in this position. One theory goes that for some years it would have been called just the \\"Jack\\", or \\"Jack flag\\", or the \\"King's Jack\\", but by 1674, while formally referred to as \\"His Majesty's Jack\\", it was commonly called the \\"Union Jack\\", and this was officially acknowledged.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmongst the proclamations issued by King George III at the time of the Union of 1801 was a proclamation concerning flags at sea, which repeatedly referred to \\"Ensigns, Flags, Jacks, and Pendants\\" and forbade merchant vessels from wearing \\"Our Jack, commonly called the Union Jack\\" nor any pendants or colours used by the King's ships.[20]  Reinforcing the distinction the King's proclamation of the same day concerning the arms and flag of the United Kingdom (not colours at sea) called the new flag \\"the Union Flag\\".[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe size and power of the Royal Navy internationally at the time could also explain why the flag was named the \\"Union Jack\\"; considering the navy was so widely utilised and renowned by the United Kingdom and colonies, it is possible that the term jack occurred because of its regular use on all British ships using the jack staff (a flag pole attached to the bow of a ship). The term Union Jack possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702ÿ14), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \\"Union Jack\\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack. In March 1899 Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called The Anglo-Saxon Review. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, \\"Your title 'The Anglo Saxon' with its motto 'Blood is thicker than water' only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworths [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.\\"[23][relevant?  ÿ discuss]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore recently, Reed's Nautical Almanac (1990 edition) unambiguously stated: \\"The Union Flag, frequently but incorrectly referred to as the Union Jack, ...\\" and later: \\"8. The Jack ÿ A small flag worn on a jackstaff on the stem of Naval Vessels.  The Royal Navy wears the Union Flag ... This is the only occasion when it correct to describe the flag as the Union Jack\\".[24] However, this assertion does not appear in any Reed's Nautical Almanac since 1993.  In  the 2016 Reeds Nautical Almanac  the only entry where this might appear, section 5.21, covering Flag Etiquette,  does not include this statement. Within the Almanac, neither the Union Flag or the Union Jack are  included  pictorially or mentioned by name.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor comparison with another anglophone country with a large navy: the Jack of the United States specifically refers to the flag flown from the jackstaff of a warship, auxiliary or other U.S. governmental entity.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current flag's design has been in use since 1801.  Its original blazon, as decreed by George III of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1801, reads: \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but is 1:2 for most purposes. In 2008, MP Andrew Rosindell proposed a Ten Minute Rule bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.[clarification needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's height whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.[28]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions,[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll HEX, CMYK and RGB specifications for the Pantone colours are taken from the official Pantone website on the webpages of the corresponding colours. Keep in mind that although the colour schemes are official, not all of the colours are completely congruent. This is due to different specifications for different types of media (for example, screen and print).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag does not have reflection symmetry due to the slight pinwheeling of the St Patrick's and St Andrew's crosses, technically the counterchange of saltires. Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \\"counterchanged\\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is above the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases wide white top and broad side up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the red ensign (also to be used as a red jack by privateers).  As it appears in the London Gazette, the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertentlyeven on commercially-made hand waving flags.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier Wen Jiabao. The error had been spotted by readers of the BBC news website who had contacted the BBC after seeing a photograph of the event.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1603, James VI of Scotland inherited the English and Irish thrones (as James I), thereby uniting the crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland (which remained separate states) in a personal union.[22] On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the flag of England (a red cross on a white background, known as St George's Cross), and the flag of Scotland (a white saltire on a blue background, known as the saltire or St Andrew's Cross), would be joined together,[8] forming the flag of Great Britain and first union flag:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the King: Whereas, some differences hath arisen between Our subjects of South and North Britaine travelling by Seas, about the bearing of their Flagges: For the avoiding of all contentions hereafter. We have, with the advice of our Council, ordered: That from henceforth all our Subjects of this Isle and Kingdome of Great Britaine, and all our members thereof, shall beare in their main-toppe the Red Crosse, commonly called St George's Crosse, and the White Crosse, commonly called St Andrews Crosse, joyned together according to the forme made by our heralds, and sent by Us to our Admerall to be published to our Subjects: and in their fore-toppe our Subjects of South Britaine shall weare the Red Crosse onely as they were wont, and our Subjects of North Britaine in their fore-toppe the White Crosse onely as they were accustomed.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis royal flag was, at first, to be used only at sea on civil and military ships of both England and Scotland, whereas land forces continued to use their respective national banners.[35] In 1634, King Charles I restricted its use to the royal ships.[17] After the Acts of Union 1707, the flag gained a regularised status as \\"the ensign armorial of the Kingdom of Great Britain\\", the newly created state. It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \\"navy\\" blue (Pantone 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the Blue Ensign of the Royal Navy's historic \\"Blue Squadron\\". (Dark shades of colour were used on maritime flags on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the Scottish Parliament recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \\"royal\\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the Lord Lyon does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA thin white stripe, or fimbriation, separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's rule of tincture where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. argent or silver). The blazon for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.\\r\\n\\r\\nWales had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by Edward I of England in 1282 and its full integration by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535ÿ1542, and was therefore represented by the flag of England.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of Ireland, which had existed as a personal union with England since 1541, was likewise unrepresented in the original versions of the Union Jack.[35] However, the flag of the Protectorate from 1658 to 1660 was inescutcheoned with the arms of Ireland. These were removed at the Restoration, because Charles II disliked them.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original flag appears in the canton of the Commissioners' Ensign of the Northern Lighthouse Board. This is the only contemporary official representation of the pre-1801 Union Jack in the United Kingdom[37] and can be seen flying from their George Street headquarters in Edinburgh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of the Union Jack is also shown in the canton of the Grand Union Flag (also known as the Congress Flag, the First Navy Ensign, the Cambridge Flag and the Continental Colours), the first widely used flag of the United States, slowly phased out after 1777.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June, painted in 1795, shows a Union flying from HMS?Queen Charlotte on the \\"Glorious First of June\\" 1794. The actual flag, preserved in the National Maritime Museum, is a cruder approximation of the proper specifications; this was common in 18th and early 19th century flags.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag is also flown beside Customs House in Loftus Street, Sydney, to mark the approximate location at which Captain Phillip first raised the Union Jack, and claimed New South Wales in 1788. On the plaque it is referred to as the \\"Jack of Queen Anne\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Army's flag is the Union Jack, but in 1938, a \\"British Army Non-Ceremonial Flag\\" was devised, featuring a lion on crossed blades with the St Edward's Crown on a red background. This is not the equivalent of the ensigns of the other armed services, but is used at recruiting and military or sporting events, when the army needs to be identified but the reverence and ceremony due to the regimental flags and the Union Jack would be inappropriate.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious other designs for a common flag were drawn up following the union of the two Crowns in 1603, but were rarely, if ever, used.[40] One version showed St George's cross with St Andrew's cross in the canton, and another version placed the two crosses side by side. A painted wooden ceiling boss from Linlithgow Palace, dated to about 1617, depicts the Scottish royal unicorn holding a flag where a blue Saltire surmounts the red cross of St. George.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn objecting to the design of Union Flag adopted in 1606, whereby the cross of Saint George surmounted that of Saint Andrew, a group of Scots took up the matter with John Erskine, 18th Earl of Mar, and were encouraged by him to send a letter of complaint to James VI, via the Privy Council of Scotland, which stated that the flag's design \\"will breid some heit and miscontentment betwix your Majesties subjectis, and it is to be feirit that some inconvenientis sail fall oute betwix thame, for our seyfaring men cannot be inducit to resave that flage as it is set down\\".[41] Although documents accompanying this complaint which contained drafts for alternative designs have been lost, evidence exists, at least on paper, of an unofficial Scottish variant, whereby the Scottish cross was uppermost. There is reason to think that cloth flags of this design were employed during the 17th century for unofficial use on Scottish vessels at sea.[42][43][44] This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn land, evidence confirming the use of this flag appears in the depiction of Edinburgh Castle by John Slezer, in his series of engravings entitled Theatrum Scotiae, c. 1693. Appearing in later editions of Theatrum Scotiae, the North East View of Edinburgh Castle engraving depicts the Scotch (to use the appropriate adjective of that period) version of the Union Flag flying from the Palace block of the Castle.[47] On the North Prospect of the City of Edenburgh engraving, the flag is indistinct.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 April 1707, just two weeks prior to the Acts of Union coming into effect, and with Sir Henry St George, Garter King of Arms, having presented several designs of flag to Queen Anne and her Privy Council for consideration, the flag for the soon to be unified Kingdom of Great Britain was chosen. At the suggestion of the Scots representatives, the designs for consideration included that version of Union Jack showing the Cross of Saint Andrew uppermost; identified as being the \\"Scotts union flagg as said to be used by the Scotts\\".[49] However, the Queen and her Council approved Sir Henry's original effort, numbered \\"one\\".[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nA manuscript compiled in 1785 by William Fox and in possession of the Flag Research Center includes a full plate showing \\"the scoth  [sic] union\\" flag. This could imply that there was still some use of a Scottish variant before the addition of the cross of St Patrick to the Union Flag in 1801.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current and second Union Jack dates from 1 January 1801 with the Act of Union 1800, which merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The new design added a red saltire, the cross of Saint Patrick, for Ireland. This is counterchanged with the saltire of St Andrew, such that the white always follows the red clockwise. The arrangement has introduced a requirement to display the flag \\"the right way up\\"; see specifications for flag use, below. As with the red cross, so too the red saltire is separated by a white fimbriation from the blue field.[22] This fimbriation is repeated for symmetry on the white portion of the saltire, which thereby appears wider than the red portion. The fimbriation of the cross of St George separates its red from the red of the saltire.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from the Union Jack, Saint Patrick's cross has seldom been used to represent Ireland, and with little popular recognition or enthusiasm; it is usually considered to derive from the arms of the powerful FitzGerald family rather than any association with the saint.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded on 6 December 1921 and the creation of the new Irish Free State was an imminent prospect, the question arose as to whether the cross of Saint Patrick should remain in the Union Jack. The New York Times reported that on 22 January 1922:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council. No parliamentary action would be necessary. Heraldry experts say that alterations in arms are very expensive. Some years ago there was a demand from Irish quarters that the blue ground of the golden harp on the royal standard should be changed to green. It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least S2,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\\r\\n\\r\\n...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great. Probably it will be found that the deletion is not absolutely necessary. Other possible changes include the abolition of the title of the United Kingdom, and the removal of the harp from the Royal Standard and the Coat of Arms, and the substitution of the Ulster emblem.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the fact that it was likely that Northern Ireland would choose not to remain part of the Irish Free State after its foundation and remain in the United Kingdom, gave better grounds for keeping the cross of St. Patrick in the Union Jack. In this regard, Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland remarked in December 1921 that he and his government were \\"glad to think that our decision [to remain part of United Kingdom] will obviate the necessity of mutilating the Union Jack.\\"[53] Though remaining within the United Kingdom, the new government of Northern Ireland dispensed with the St Patrick's Saltire in favour of a new flag derived from the coat-of-arm of the Burkes, Earls of Ulster, and quite similar to England's St George's Cross.\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, when the British home secretary was asked on 7 December 1922 (the day after the Irish Free State was established) whether the Garter King of Arms was to issue any regulations with reference to the Union Jack, the response was no and the flag has never been changed.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dil question in 1961 mooted raising the removal of the cross of St Patrick with the British government; Frank Aiken, the Irish minister for external affairs, declined to \\"waste time on heraldic disputations\\".[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, a private individual started a campaign?ÿ dubbed \\"reflag\\" or \\"Union Black\\"?ÿ to interpret the Union Flag in a racial context, and introduce black stripes in it. The proposal was universally met with opposition and was denounced by MSP Phil Gallie as \\"ridiculous tokenism [that] would do nothing to stamp out racism\\".[56] The campaign is now defunct.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince there is no uniquely Welsh element in the Union Jack, Wrexham's Labour MP Ian Lucas proposed on 27 November 2007 in a House of Commons debate that the Union Flag be combined with the Welsh flag to reflect Wales' status within the UK, and that the red dragon be added to the Union Flag's red, white, and blue pattern.[57] He said the Union Jack currently only represented the other three UK nations, and Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism Margaret Hodge conceded that Lucas had raised a valid point for debate. She said, \\"the Government is keen to make the Union Flag a positive symbol of Britishness reflecting the diversity of our country today and encouraging people to take pride in our flag.\\" This development sparked design contests with entries from all over the world; some of the entries incorporated red dragons and even anime characters and leeks.[58][59] The lack of any Welsh symbol or colours in the flag is due to Wales already being part of the Kingdom of England when the flag of Great Britain was created in 1606.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, various non-official suggestions were made for how the flag could be redesigned without the St Andrew's Cross in the event that Scotland left the Union. However, as Scotland voted against independence the issue did not arise.[60][61]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the UK referendum on membership of the European Union which resulted in a vote to leave, the Union Flag became a symbol of euroscepticism in Italy in August 2016 as hundreds of local businesses along the Italian riviera hoisted the flags as a protest against the implementation of the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2016, anti-Brexit campaigners planned to fly 5,000 European Union flags on the last night of the BBC Proms, in response, Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks announced he planned to fund and give away 10,000 Union Flags to concert-goers.[63][64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is used as a jack by commissioned warships and submarines of the Royal Navy, and by commissioned army and Royal Air Force vessels. When at anchor or alongside, it is flown from the jackstaff at the bow of the ship. When a ship is underway, the Union Jack is only flown from the jackstaff when the ship is dressed for a special occasion, such as the Queen's official birthday.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is worn at the masthead of a ship to indicate the presence of the Sovereign or an Admiral of the Fleet.[65] The Union Flag may also be flown from the yardarm to indicate that a court-martial is in progress, though these are now normally held at shore establishments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo law has been passed making the Union Jack the national flag of the United Kingdom: it has become one through precedent. Its first recorded recognition as a national flag came in 1908, when it was stated in Parliament that \\"the Union Jack should be regarded as the National flag\\".[66] A more categorical statement was made by Home Secretary Sir John Gilmour, in 1933 when he stated that \\"the Union Flag is the national flag and may properly be flown by any British subject on land.\\"[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilian use is permitted on land, but use of the unmodified flag at sea is restricted to military vessels. Unauthorised use of the flag in the 17th century to avoid paying harbour duties?ÿ a privilege restricted to naval ships?ÿ caused James's successor, Charles I, to order that use of the flag on naval vessels be restricted to His Majesty's ships \\"upon pain of Our high displeasure.\\"[citation needed] It remains a criminal offence under the Merchant Shipping Act 1995[68] to display the Union Flag (other than the \\"pilot jack\\"?ÿ see below) from a British ship. Naval ships will fly the white ensign, merchant and private boats can fly the red ensign, others with special permission such as naval yacht clubs can fly the blue ensign. All of the coloured ensigns contain the union flag as part of the design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Court of the Lord Lyon, which has legal jurisdiction in heraldic matters in Scotland, confirms that the Union Jack \\"is the correct flag for all citizens and corporate bodies of the United Kingdom to fly to demonstrate their loyalty and their nationality.\\"[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Australia, the current national flag gradually replaced the Union Flag. When it formally created the national flag in the Flags Act 1953, section 8 of that Act specified that \\"this Act does not affect the right or privilege of a person to fly the Union Jack.\\" The Union Jack continued to be used for a period thereafter as a national flag.[70] The current national flag of New Zealand was given official standing under the New Zealand Ensign Act in 1902, but similarly to Australia the Union Jack continued to be used in some contexts as a national flag.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 February 2008, Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell introduced the 'Union Flag Bill' as a private member's bill under the 10 Minute Rule in the House of Commons. The Bill sought to formalise the position of the Union Flag as the national flag of the UK in law, to remove legal obstacles to its regular display and to officially recognise the name 'Union Jack' as having equal status with 'Union Flag'. However the Bill did not receive its second reading by the end of that parliamentary session.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack was introduced into South Africa in 1795, and except for the period 1803-06, it was an official flag until 1957.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Union of South Africa was established in 1910, the Union Jack was treated as its official flag. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe continued use of the Union Jack as national flag became an issue in the 1920s, when the government proposed to introduce a National Flag of the Union.  A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new  National Flag.  The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the National Flag at the  Houses of Parliament, from the principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine.[73] [74]  This dual arrangement was effective from 31 May 1928.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstructions issued in 1931 confirmed the places where both flags were to be flown.  In addition to those already mentioned, they were the Union Buildings (Pretoria), the head offices of the four provincial administrations, the  supreme courts, certain  magistrates' courts, customs houses, and three buildings in Durban (the general post office, the  railway station, and the local  military district headquarters).[75] [74]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder these arrangements, the Union Jack was subordinate to the National Flag.  As the two flags had to be the same size, it meant that the Union Jack was made in the ratio 2:3 rather than the usual 1:2.[76][74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flying of the Union Jack alongside the National Flag ended on 6 April 1957.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predecessor of the Union Jack, the flag of Great Britain, came into use in what is now Canada at the time of the Scottish settlement of Nova Scotia in 1621.[78] The Union Flag was also the official flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland and continued in use there after Newfoundland became a Canadian province. The province adopted its own flag in 1980, employing a design based on that of the Union Flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the close of the Great Canadian Flag Debate in 1964, which resulted in the adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag as Canada's national flag the following year, a resolution was passed by both houses of the Canadian parliament naming the Union Flag as the Royal Union Flag and designating it as the symbol of Canada's membership of the Commonwealth and its allegiance to the Crown. The move was a concession given to conservatives, who preferred to keep the old flag, with its Union Flag in the canton. A federal directive says the Royal Union Flag is to be flown alongside the Maple Leaf Flag at federal government buildings, federally-operated airports and military bases, and at the masthead of Her Majesty's Canadian ships within Canadian waters[79] on three days of the year: Commonwealth Day, the Canadian monarch's official birthday, and the anniversary of the enactment of the Statute of Westminster 1931.[79] The flag is to be raised only where there is more than one flag pole, to ensure the flag of Canada is not removed. The directive is sometimes followed, sometimes not.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the most common ratio is 1:2, other ratios exist. The Royal Navy's flag code book, BR20 Flags of All Nations, states that both 1:2 and 3:5 versions are official.[81] The 3:5 version is most commonly used by the British Army and is sometimes known as the War flag. In this version the innermost points of the lower left and upper right diagonals of the St Patrick's cross are cut off or truncated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Queen's Harbour Master's flag, like the Pilot Jack, is a 1:2 flag that contains a white-bordered Union Flag that is longer than 1:2. The jacks of ships flying variants of the Blue Ensign are square and have a square Union Flag in the canton.[81] The Queen's Colours of Army regiments are 36 by 43 inches (910?mm G?1,090?mm); on them, the bars of the cross and saltire are of equal width; so are their respective fimbriations, which are very narrow.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs stated above, the Union Jacks flown alongside the National Flag in South Africa between 1928 and 1957 were 2:3 flags. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag was found in the canton (upper left-hand quarter) of the flags of many colonies of Britain, while the field (background) of their flags was the colour of the naval ensign flown by the particular Royal Navy squadron that patrolled that region of the world. Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included Aden, Barbados, Borneo, Burma, Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Cyprus, British East Africa (Kenya Colony), Gambia, Gold Coast (Ghana), Hong Kong, Jamaica, Lagos, Malta, Mauritius, Nigeria, Palestine, Penang (Malaysia), Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Somaliland, British India, Tanganyika, Trinidad, Uganda, the United States, and Weihaiwei. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former Dependent Territory of Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of Gibraltar (other than the government ensign) and the Crown Dependencies. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special ensign in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and Tuvalu, which have retained the monarchy; and Fiji, which abolished the monarchy in 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used semi-interchangeably with territorial flags for significant parts of their early history. This was the case in Canada until the introduction of the Maple Leaf Flag in 1965, but it is still used in the flags of a number of Canadian provinces such as British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. Newfoundland and Labrador uses a modified version of the Union Flag, once the flag of the province.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with the national flag, many other Australian flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the Royal Australian Navy Ensign (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, the Australian Red Ensign (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the Australian Civil Aviation Ensign. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower Murray River Flags. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basque Country's flag, the Ikurri?a, is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between Bilbao and Britain at the time the Ikurri?a was designed in 1894. The Miskito people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the Mosquito Coast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the Grand Union Flag. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the British East India Company. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its state flag. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, George Vancouver, during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the flag of Baton Rouge, the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the Seven Years' War until the end of the American Revolutionary War, when it was captured by Spanish and American forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, has in recent years[when?] used a flag with the old style Union Flag.  Likewise, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910ÿ1928 and 1928ÿ1994 flags of South Africa. The 1910ÿ1928 flag was a red ensign with the Union coat of arms in the fly. The 1928ÿ1994 flag, based on the Prinsenvlag and commonly known as the oranje-blanje-blou (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coat of arms of the Chilean city of Coquimbo features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the ensigns flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the White ensign (Royal Navy), the Red ensign (Merchant and private boats) or the Blue ensign (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as New Zealand and Australia) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as India and Jamaica) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the Pilot Jack. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book[clarification needed] issued to British consuls in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the Red Ensign for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \\"except the Red Ensign, the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \\"British flag\\", and states that \\"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced Red Ensign), no other colours.\\"[84] Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the de facto Civil Jack.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival North West Company had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Jack is the third quarter of the 1939 coat of arms of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2007, the British prime minister at the time, Gordon Brown, unveiled plans to have the Union Flag flown more often from government buildings.[85] While consultation on new guidelines is under way, the decision to fly the flag may be made by each government department.[old info]\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously the flag was generally only flown on public buildings on days marking the birthdays of members of the Royal Family, the wedding anniversary of the monarch, Commonwealth Day, Accession Day, Coronation Day, the Queen's Official Birthday, Remembrance Sunday, and on the days of the State Opening and prorogation of Parliament. The Union Flag is flown at half mast from the announcement of the death of the Sovereign (save for Proclamation Day), or upon command of the Sovereign.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current flag days where the Union Flag should be flown from government buildings throughout the UK are:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, the Union Flag should be flown in the following areas on specified days:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 November, (St Andrew's Day), the Union Flag can be flown in Scotland only where a building has more than one flagpoleon this day the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole.[88] This difference arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day. However, on 23 April, St George's Day, it is the Union Flag of the United Kingdom that is flown over United Kingdom's government offices in England.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-government organisations may fly the Union Flag whenever they choose.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag has no official status in the United Kingdom, and there are no national regulations concerning its use or prohibitions against flag desecration. In Northern Ireland, the Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000 provide for the flying of the flag on government buildings on certain occasions, when it is flown half mast, and how it is displayed with other flags.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Flags and Heraldry Committee, an all-party parliamentary group lobbying for official standards, cooperated with the Flag Institute in 2010 to publish a set of recommended guidelines for the flag's display and use as a symbol.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no specific way in which the Union Flag should be folded as there is with the United States Flag. It is usually folded rectilinearly, with the hoist on the outside, to be easily reattached to the pole.[91][92]\\r\\n\\r\\nRoyal Navy Stores Duties Instructions, article 447, dated 26 February 1914, specified that flags condemned from further service use were to be torn up into small pieces and disposed of as rags (ADM 1/8369/56), not to be used for decoration or sold. The exception was flags that had flown in action: these could be framed and kept on board, or transferred to a \\"suitable place\\", such as a museum (ADM 1/8567/245).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 the Australian Flag Society announced a worldwide quest and a A$10,000 reward for information leading to the discovery of the Union Jack which was reportedly hoisted beneath the Eureka flag at the Battle of the Eureka Stockade.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the de facto national flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack serves as a patriotic or nationalist symbol, and can also carry associations of militarism and imperialism.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nWinston Churchill wrote about the use of the Union Jack as a symbol connected to British nationalism and imperialism. In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called The Anglo-Saxon Review. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \\"The Anglo Saxon\\" with its motto \\"Blood is thicker than water\\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of fashion since the British Invasion movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American Stars and Stripes flag. A notable increase in popularity was seen in Cuba following the 2012 summer Olympics, with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an icon representing a choice of the English language where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user. The flag has been embroidered on various Reebok equipment as a mark of the brand's British origin,[101] and the Reebok Union Jack has been referred to as a brand icon.[102] Many music artists have used the Union flag ranging from rock artists The Who, Sex Pistols, Freddie Mercury, Morrissey, Oasis, Iron Maiden, and Def Leppard, to the pop girl group the Spice Girls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBattle scene from Ray Wenban's The Revolt at Eureka.\\r\\n\\r\\nA folk cartoon inspired by the 1854 Eureka Rebellion entitled Fall back with the Eureka Jack.","input":"What is the colour of the england flag?"},{"output":"1 July","context":"The 2017 Tour de France was the 104th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The 3,540?km (2,200?mi)-long race commenced with an individual time trial in Dsseldorf, Germany on 1 July, and concluded with the Champs-lyses stage in Paris on 23 July. A total of 198 riders from 22 teams entered the 21-stage race, which was won by Chris Froome of Team Sky, his fourth overall victory. Rigoberto Urn (CannondaleÿDrapac) and Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale) finished second and third, respectively.\\r\\nGeraint Thomas (Team Sky) won the opening stage and became the Tour's first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey. Froome, who performed the best in the opening stage out of the pre-race favourites, took the lead after the fifth stage's summit finish. He held the lead until it was taken by Fabio Aru (Astana) at the end of stage twelve, where Froome lost time on the steep summit finish to Peyragudes. Froome retook the yellow jersey after the fourteenth stage and held it until the end of the race.\\r\\nThe points classification was won by Michael Matthews of Team Sunweb, with teammate Warren Barguil, winner of two high mountain stages, taking the mountains classification as well as the award for most combative rider. OricaÿScott's Simon Yates, in seventh place overall, won the young rider classification. The team classification was won by Team Sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2017 edition of the Tour de France consisted of 22 teams.[1] All eighteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race.[2] On 26 January 2017, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations, of which three were French-based (Cofidis, Direct nergie and FortuneoÿOscaro) and one was Belgian (WantyÿGroupe Gobert, which participated in the race for the first time).[3] FortuneoÿOscaro were initially invited to the race as FortuneoÿVital Concept,[4] before a change of sponsorship prior to the opening day of racing.[5] The presentation of the teams?ÿ where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries?ÿ took place in front of a crowd of 15,000 at the Burgplatz?(de) square in Dsseldorf, Germany, on 29 June, two days before the opening stage held in the city.[6]\\r\\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 198 riders.[7] Of these, 49 were competing in their first Tour de France.[8] The total number of riders that finished the race was 167.[9] The riders came from 32 countries. Six countries had more than 10 riders in the race: France (39), Italy (18), Belgium (16), Germany (16), the Netherlands (15), and Spain (13).[7] The average age of riders in the race was 29.4 years,[10] ranging from the 22-year-old lie Gesbert (FortuneoÿOscaro) to the 40-year-old Haimar Zubeldia (TrekÿSegafredo).[11][12] CannondaleÿDrapac had the youngest average age while Team Dimension Data had the oldest.[13]\\r\\nUCI WorldTeams\\r\\nUCI Professional Continental teams\\r\\nIn the lead up to the 2017 Tour de France, Chris Froome (Team Sky) was seen by many as the top pre-race favourite for the general classification.[14][15][16][17][18][excessive citations] His closest rivals were thought to be Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Nairo Quintana (Movistar Team), Alberto Contador (TrekÿSegafredo), Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale) and Fabio Aru (Astana).[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][excessive citations] The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Alejandro Valverde (Movistar Team), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana), Thibaut Pinot (FDJ), Esteban Chaves (OricaÿScott), Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Dan Martin (Quick-Step Floors), Simon Yates (OricaÿScott), and Louis Meintjes (UAE Team Emirates).[17][17][20][21][22][excessive citations]\\r\\nFroome, who won the 2013, 2015 and 2016 editions of the Tour, had not won a race in the 2017 season prior to the Tour's start. His best result was fourth overall at the Critrium du Dauphin, a race considered to be the warm-up for the Tour and one he has won before his three previous Tour victories. Despite this, he was thought to have one of the strongest teams in the race that would ride in total support of him.[16][18] The 32-year-old Porte, who placed fifth in the 2016 Tour, won the general classification in two stage races so far in 2017, the Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie, and came second in the Dauphin.[18] Quintana, third in the 2016 Tour, placed second at the Giro d'Italia, with overalls wins at the TirrenoÿAdriatico and the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana earlier in the season.[21] The two-time winner (2007 and 2009) 34-year-old Contador came second overall in four stage races in 2017 before the Tour, ParisÿNice, the Vuelta a Andaluca, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of the Basque Country.[21] Bardet, the 2017 Tour runner-up, placed sixth overall in the Dauphin, with his best other result sixth in the one-day Classic race LigeÿBastogneÿLige.[18] Aru started the Tour sharing team leadership with the Dauphin winner Fuglsang. Aru won the Italian National Road Race Championships a week before the Tour and placed fifth at the Dauphin.[21]\\r\\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (BoraÿHansgrohe), Marcel Kittel (Quick-Step Floors), Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data), Andr Greipel (LottoÿSoudal), and Alexander Kristoff (Team KatushaÿAlpecin). Others expected to contend for sprint finishes included Michael Matthews (Team Sunweb), Arnaud Dmare (FDJ), Dylan Groenewegen (LottoNLÿJumbo), John Degenkolb (TrekÿSegafredo), Sonny Colbrelli (UAE Team Emirates) and Nacer Bouhanni (Cofidis).[19][23][24][25][26][27][excessive citations] Double reigning world road race champion Sagan had won the five previous points classifications of the Tour, one away from matching Erik Zabel's record of six from 1996 to 2001.[19][28] His form in the 2017 season before the Tour included winning the one-day race KuurneÿBrusselsÿKuurne and the points classifications in TirrenoÿAdriatico, the Tour de Suisse and the Tour of California.[29] Kittel had gained eight wins so far in 2017, as well as the general and points classifications in the Dubai Tour at the start of the season.[30] Cavendish's season before the Tour was affected by glandular fever, missing around three months;[19] his only success had been a stage win and the points classification at the Abu Dhabi Tour.[31] Greipel had amassed four wins in 2017 before the Tour, including one at the Giro.[26] Kristoff had taken six wins so far in 2017, and the points classifications at the Tour of Oman, the toile de Bessges and the Three Days of De Panne.[32]\\r\\nThe start of the 2017 Tour de France (known as the Grand Dpart) was originally scheduled to be in London, United Kingdom; this would have been the third time the Tour had visited London, following the 2007 and 2014 editions. In September 2015, a week before this was due to be announced, Transport for London pulled out of the bid.[33] It was later revealed that this was the decision of the then Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on the grounds of cost: hosting the Grand Depart would have cost S35 million.[34] In December 2015, the ASO announced that the Grand Dpart would take place with stages based in Dsseldorf; the fourth time the Tour has begun in Germany and the first since 1987. The bid to host the Tour was only narrowly approved by the city council. The return to Germany followed a resurgence in German professional cycling.[35] On 14 January 2016, details of the opening two stages were announced. The first stage would be a 13-kilometre (8.1?mi) individual time trial in Dsseldorf itself. The second stage would also begin in Dsseldorf.[36] The full route was announced by race director Christian Prudhomme on 18 October 2016 at the Palais des Congrs in Paris.[37]\\r\\nAfter the first time trial, the race left Germany during stage two, which finished in the Belgian city of Lige.[38] Stage three headed south, and after a brief passage through Luxembourg, ended with a climb in Longwy.[39] After a transitional stage, stage five saw the first major climb, the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles.[38] The next two stages headed south-west,[38] before stage eight in the Jura Mountains, featured three categorised climbs.[40] The ninth stage included the steep climbs of the Col de la Biche?(fr), the Col du Grand Colombier, and, after a 42-year absence, the Signal du Mont du Chat, its summit 25?km (15.5?mi) from the finish in Chambry.[41][42] After a transfer during the rest day, stage ten took place in the Dordogne region, between Prigueux and Bergerac. Stage eleven was a transitional stage, followed by two stages in the Pyrenees. Stage twelve started from Pau and ended at the Peyragudes ski resort.[38] The next stage was short, at 110?km (68?mi), but included three climbs before a descent finish into Foix.[43] After leaving the Pyrenees, the riders headed north-east; stage fourteen finished with a climb towards the end of the stage.[44] Stage fifteen featured the first appearance of the Col de Peyra Taillade, with its conclusion in Le Puy-en-Velay.[45] Stage sixteen, the first after the final rest day, was a transitional stage, heading east, towards the Alps.[38] Stage seventeen included the Col d'Ornon, the Col de la Croix de Fer, the Col du Tlgraphe and the highest point of elevation in the race, the Col du Galibier, before a descent finish into Serre Chevalier.[46] Stage eighteen was the final day of mountains; it had two climbs, the Col de Vars and the finishing climb, the Col d'Izoard.[47] It was the first time the Tour finished on the 2,360?m (7,743?ft)-high mountain pass.[48] After another transitional stage, heading south, came stage twenty, a 23?km (14.3?mi) individual time trial in Marseille.[38] Starting at the Stade Vlodrome, the course headed around the city, designated 2017 European Capital of Sport, before ending also at the Stade Vlodrome.[49] The final stage started in Montgeron, which hosted the start of the first Tour, before concluding with the traditional laps of the Champs-lyses.[37][38]\\r\\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of 3,540?km (2,200?mi), 13?km (8.1?mi) shorter than the 2016 Tour.[38][50] There were two time trial events, both of which were individual, a total of 36?km (22.4?mi).[38] Of the remaining nineteen stages, eight were officially classified as flat, six as medium mountain and five as high mountain.[51][38] The longest mass-start stage was stage 19, at 222.5?km (138?mi), and the shortest was stage 13, at 101?km (63?mi).[38] For the first time since the 1992 edition, the route included all five of mainland France's mountainous regions; the Vosges, the Jura, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central and the Alps.[52][53] There were summit finishes on stage 12 to Peyragudes and stage 18 to the Col d'Izoard. Additionally, the hilly stage 3 had a hilltop finish in Longwy, and stage 5 ended at La Planche des Belles Filles.[54] There were seven hors catgorie (English: \\"out of category\\") rated climbs in the race.[54] The Tour included ten new start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 9, in the Dordogne, and 15, in Le Puy-en-Velay.[38]\\r\\nThe opening stage's individual time trial was won by Geraint Thomas with a time of 16 min 4 s over the 14?km (8.7?mi) course. Thomas took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Chris Froome was the highest placed of the general classification favourites, in sixth place, sixteen seconds down.[57] Overall contender Alejandro Valverde crashed on the wet roads and his injuries forced him to withdraw from the Tour.[58] Marcel Kittel won stage two's bunch sprint, and with it the green jersey. Breakaway rider Taylor Phinney (CannondaleÿDrapac) took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.[59] The uphill sprint finish of stage three was won by Peter Sagan; Nathan Brown (CannondaleÿDrapac) took over the polka dot jersey.[60] The fourth stage ended with a bunch sprint and was won by Arnaud Dmare (FDJ), with him also taking the green jersey.[61] There were two crashes leading up to the finish, the first was in the peloton around 1?km (0.6?mi) to go and the second involved the sprinters at the end. In the sprint finish, Mark Cavendish crashed into the barriers at the side of the road, withdrawing later that day from the race from his injuries. Sagan, second in the stage, was disqualified after race officials judged that he caused Cavendish to crash, with the jury president Philippe Marien saying that he \\"endangered some of his colleagues seriously\\".[62][63]\\r\\nIn the fifth stage, a group containing the overall contenders caught the last of the breakaway riders 5?km (3.1?mi) from the summit finish at La Planche des Belles Filles. With 2.4?km (1.5?mi) remaining, Fabio Aru attacked and won with a margin of sixteen seconds over the group. Thomas lost twenty seconds on the group and lost the yellow jersey to teammate Froome. Aru took over the lead of the mountains classification.[64] Kittel won the following two stages which ended in bunch sprints.[65][66] The latter stage was decided by a photo finish, with Kittel 6?mm ahead of Edvald Boasson Hagen (Team Dimension Data); Kittel regained the green jersey.[66] In stage eight, the first high mountain stage, Lilian Calmejane of Direct nergie attacked over the category 1 climb of Monte de la Combe de Laisia Les Molunes from a six-strong lead breakaway and soloed for 11.5?km (7.1?mi) to take the win 37 seconds ahead of second placed and lone chaser Robert Gesink (LottoNLÿJumbo). Calmejane put himself into the polka dot jersey.[67] The ninth stage saw a select group of general classification favourites join Warren Barguil (Team Sunweb) after the final of the Mont du Chat and contest a sprint finish, won by Rigoberto Urn (CannondaleÿDrapac). Barguil took lead of the mountains classification.[68] Richie Porte crashed descending the Mont du Chat whilst in the group of overall contenders and withdrew from the race.[69] The following day was the Tour's first rest rest day.[38]\\r\\nStages ten and eleven were won from bunch sprints by Kittel, taking his total of wins at the race to five.[70] The twelfth stage saw the overall contenders all reach the foot of the short steep climb to Peyragudes; Romain Bardet won by a margin of two seconds. Froome came seventh, 22 seconds down, and lost the overall lead to third-placed Aru.[71] The 101?km (62.8?mi)-long stage thirteen was won by Barguil, who won the sprint after a descent from an elite group with Nairo Quintana, Alberto Contador and Mikel Landa (Team Sky). The chasing group of overall contenders came in 1 min 39 s down.[72] In the fourteenth stage, a reduced peloton contested the uphill sprint finish at Rodez, which was won Team Sunweb rider Michael Matthews. Aru's advantage of six seconds over Froome was changed to a deficit of eighteen, after Aru came in thirty seconds down in thirtieth place and Froome was seventh, one second behind the Matthews.[73]\\r\\nStage fifteen saw TrekÿSegafredo's Bauke Mollema attack a breakaway group over the top of the Col de Peyra Taillade with 31?km (19.3?mi) to go and solo to victory. In the large group containing the overall contenders, Bardet's team AG2R La Mondiale forced a high pace on the Peyra Taillade. A further 6?km (3.7?mi) later on the climb, Froome suffered a broken spoke, and, after receiving a new wheel from a teammate and some assistance from three other teammates, he was able to chase back up to the group.[74][75] The next day was the second rest day of the race.[38] In the sixteenth stage, the high pace set by Matthews's Team Sunweb dropped the green jersey wearer Kittel; Matthews, who was second to Kittel in points classification, won the stage.[76] Primo? Rogli? (LottoNLÿJumbo), second behind Barguil in the mountains classification, won the following mountainous stage after a solo attack on the Col du Galibier, finishing in Serre Chevalier after a descent over a minute ahead of a four-man group containing the new top overall top three in the general classification Froome, Urn and Bardet, respectively, and also Barguil. Aru dropped from second overall to fourth. Kittel crashed and withdrew from the Tour, putting Matthews in the green jersey.[77]\\r\\nThe final high mountain stage of the Tour, the eighteenth, saw Barguil claim his second victory of the race on the summit finsh at Col d'Izoard; he was initially caught by the group of overall favourites on the final climb after being the one of last survivors from the breakaway, with only Darwin Atapuma (UAE Team Emirates) ahead. Barguil's winning move came with 3?km (1.9?mi) remaining, passing Atapuma to win by twenty seconds. A three-way sprint for fourth place saw Bardet finish just ahead of Froome with Urn placing fifth; Bardet moved up to second overall, six seconds ahead of Urn, with Froome holding a 23 second advantage.[78] Boasson Hagen won stage nineteen with an attack from a reduced breakaway with 2.5?km (1.6?mi) to go.[79] Maciej Bodnar of BoraÿHansgrohe won the 22.5?km (14.0?mi) individual time trial of the penultimate stage, setting a time of 28 min 15 s. Froome was third, six seconds down, increasing his lead in the general classification to 54 seconds. Bardet dropped to third overall after he lost over two minutes in the stage, and Urn was 31 seconds in arrears.[80]\\r\\nThe final stage in Paris was won by Dylan Groenewegen in a bunch sprint on the Champs-lyses. Froome finished the race to win his fourth Tour de France.[81] Urn placed second overall, 54 seconds down, with Bardet 2 min 20 s behind, just one second ahead of Landa (fourth overall). Matthews won the points classification with a total of 370, 136 ahead of Andr Greipel in second. Barguil won the mountains classification with 169 points, 89 ahead of second-placed Rogli?. The best young rider was seventh-placed overall Simon Yates, who was followed by Louis Meintjes (eighth overall) in second, 2 min 6 s down. An OricaÿScott rider won the classification for the second consecutive year, after Yates' twin brother Adam won in 2016. Team Sky finished as the winners of the team classification, 7 min 14 s ahead of second-placed AG2R La Mondiale.[9]\\r\\nThere were four main individual classifications being contested in the 2017 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.[82] Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the two individual time trials. The first three riders get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively.[83] For crashes within the final 3?km (1.9?mi) of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.[84] The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour.[82] The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.[82] The leader was identified by a green jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catgorie.[82] Double points were awarded on the summit finish of the Col d'Izoard on stage 18.[82] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[85]\\r\\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1992.[83] The leader wore a white jersey.[85]\\r\\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.[83] The riders in the team that led this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.[85]\\r\\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \\"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\\".[83] No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage.[86] The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.[83] At the conclusion of the Tour, Warren Barguil won the overall super-combativity award,[9] again, decided by a jury.[83]\\r\\nA total of ?2,280,950 was awarded in cash prizes in the race.[86] The overall winner of the general classification received ?500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting ?200,000 and ?100,000 respectively.[87] All finishers in the top 160 were awarded with money.[87] The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given ?25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got ?20,000.[88] The team classification winners were given ?50,000.[89] ?11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2ÿ20.[87] There was also a special award with a prize of ?5,000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider (Primo? Rogli?) to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col du Galibier on stage seventeen.[86][77]\\r\\nThe race was the 25th of the 38 events in the UCI World Tour,[90] with riders from the WorldTeams competing for individually and for their teams for points that contributed towards the rankings. Riders from both the WorldTeams and Professional Continental teams also competed individually and for their nations for points that contributed towards the UCI World Ranking, which included all UCI races.[91] Both rankings used the same points scale, awarding points to the top sixty in the general classification, each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage, the top five finishers in each stage and for the top three in the final points and mountains classcifications.[92] The points accrued by Chris Froome moved him up to sixth from twentieth in the World Tour and kept his fifth in the World Ranking. Greg Van Avermaet (BMC Racing Team) held the lead of both individual rankings, with EtixxÿQuick-Step and Belgium also holding the lead of the World Tour team ranking and World Ranking nation ranking respectively.[93][94]","input":"Where did the 2017 tour de france start?"},{"output":"syncytial virus","context":"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a syncytial virus that causes respiratory tract infections. It is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. A prophylactic medication, palivizumab, can be employed to prevent HRSV in preterm (under 35 weeks gestation) infants, infants with certain congenital heart defects (CHD) or bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and infants with congenital malformations of the airway. Treatment is limited to supportive care, including oxygen therapy and more advanced breathing support with CPAP or nasal high flow oxygen.\\r\\nIn temperate climates there is an annual epidemic during the winter months. In tropical climates, infection is most common during the rainy season.\\r\\nIn the United States, 60% of infants are infected during their first HRSV season,[1] and nearly all children will have been infected with the virus by 2ÿ3 years of age.[1] Of those infected with RSV, 2ÿ3% will develop bronchiolitis, necessitating hospitalization.[2] Natural infection with HRSV induces protective immunity which wanes over timepossibly more so than other respiratory viral infectionsand thus people can be infected multiple times. Sometimes an infant can become symptomatically infected more than once, even within a single HRSV season. Severe HRSV infections have increasingly been found among elderly patients. Young adults can be re-infected every five to seven years, with symptoms looking like a sinus infection or a cold (infections can also be asymptomatic).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incubation time (from infection until symptoms arrive) is 4ÿ5 days. For adults, HRSV produces mainly mild symptoms, often indistinguishable from common colds and minor illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control consider HRSV to be the \\"most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia in children under 1 year of age in the United States\\".[3] For some children, RSV can cause bronchiolitis, leading to severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization and, rarely, causing death. This is more likely to occur in patients that are immunocompromised or infants born prematurely. Other HRSV symptoms common among infants include listlessness, poor or diminished appetite, and a possible fever.\\r\\nRecurrent wheezing and asthma are more common among individuals who suffered severe HRSV infection during the first few months of life than among controls;[4] whether HRSV infection sets up a process that leads to recurrent wheezing or whether those already predisposed to asthma are more likely to become severely ill with HRSV has yet to be determined.\\r\\nSymptoms of pneumonia in immuno-compromised patients such as in transplant patients and especially bone marrow transplant patients should be evaluated to rule out HRSV infection. This can be done by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for HRSV nucleic acids in peripheral blood samples if all other infectious processes have been ruled out or if it is highly suspicious for RSV such as a recent exposure to a known source of HRSV infection.\\r\\nIn one case, HRSV onset appears to have coincided with the onset of type 2 diabetes.[5][6]\\r\\nThe incubation period is 2ÿ8 days, but is usually 4ÿ6 days.\\r\\nHRSV spreads easily by direct contact, and can remain viable for a half an hour or more on hands or for up to 5 hours on countertops.[7] Childcare facilities allow for rapid child-to-child transmission in a short period of time.[8]\\r\\nThe HRSV is virtually the same as chimpanzee coryza virus and can be transmitted from apes to humans, although transmission from humans to apes is more common.[9] The virus has also been recovered from cattle, goats and sheep, but these are not regarded as major vectors of transmission and there is no animal reservoir of the virus.\\r\\nHRSV can last 2ÿ8 days, but symptoms may persist for up to three weeks.\\r\\nHRSV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Pneumoviridae. Its name comes from the fact that F proteins on the surface of the virus cause the cell membranes on nearby cells to merge, forming syncytia.\\r\\nHuman respiratory syncytial virus is a medium-sized (120ÿ200?nm) enveloped virus that contains a lipoprotein coat and a linear negative-sense RNA genome (must be converted to an anti-sense genome prior to translation). The former contains virally encoded F, G, and SH lipoproteins. The F and G lipoproteins are the only two that target the cell membrane, and are highly conserved among RSV isolates. HRSV is divided into two antigenic subgroups, A and B, on the basis of the reactivity of the virus with monoclonal antibodies against the attachment (G) and fusion (F)[10] glycoproteins. Subtype B is characterized as the asymptomatic strains of the virus that the majority of the population experiences. The more severe clinical illnesses involve subtype A strains, which tend to predominate in most outbreaks.\\r\\nFour of the viral genes code for intracellular proteins that are involved in genome transcription, replication, and particle budding, namely N (nucleoprotein), P (phosphoprotein), M (matrix protein), and L (large protein, containing the RNA polymerase catalytic motifs). The RSV genomic RNA forms a helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with the N protein, termed nucleocapsid, which is used as template for RNA synthesis by the viral polymerase complex. The three-dimensional crystal structure of a decameric, annular ribonucleoprotein complex of the RSV nucleoprotein (N) bound to RNA has been determined at 3.3 ? resolution. This complex mimics one turn of the viral helical nucleocapsid complex. Its crystal structure was combined with electron microscopy data to provides a detailed model for the RSV nucleocapsid.[11]\\r\\nThe genome is ~15,000 nucleotides in length and is composed of a single strand of RNA with negative polarity. It has 10 genes encoding 11 proteins.[12]\\r\\nTo date, 10 HRSV-A genotypes have been designated, GA1 to GA7, SAA1, NA1, and NA2. The HRSV-B genotypes include GB1 to GB4, SAB1 to SAB3, and BA1 to BA6.[12]\\r\\nThe genome of HRSV was completely sequenced in 1997.\\r\\nBayesian estimates of the mutation rates in the subtype A genomes give a mutation rate of 6.47G10?4 (credible interval: 5.56G10?4 ÿ 7.38G10?4) substitutions/site/year.[13] This is similar to other RNA viruses. The population size has remained constant over the last 70 years and the G protein appears to be the main site of diversifying selection. The most recent common ancestor evolved ~1943 (credible interval: 1923ÿ1954). The HRSV-B evolutionary rate (1.95G10?3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year) is similar to that previously estimated for HRSV-A (1.83G10?3 nucleotide substitutions/site/year). However, natural HRSV-B isolates appear to accommodate more drastic changes in their attachment G proteins. The most recent common ancestor of the currently circulating subgroup B strains was estimated to date back to around the year 1949. The divergence between the two major subgroups was calculated to have occurred approximately 350 years ago (mid-17th century).\\r\\nHuman respiratory syncytial virus may be suspected based on the time of year of the infection; prevalence usually coincides with the winter flu season.\\r\\nSeveral different types of laboratory tests are commercially available for diagnosis of RSV infection. Rapid diagnostic assays performed on respiratory specimens are available commercially. Most clinical laboratories currently utilize antigen detection tests. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of antigen detection tests generally ranges from 80% to 90%. Antigen detection tests and culture are generally reliable in young children but less useful in older children and adults.\\r\\nSensitivity of virus isolation from respiratory secretions in cell culture varies among laboratories. RT-PCR assays are now commercially available. The sensitivity of these assays is equal to or exceeds the sensitivity of virus isolation and antigen detections methods. Highly sensitive RT-PCR assays should be considered when testing adults, because they may have low viral loads in their respiratory specimens.\\r\\nSerologic tests are less frequently used for diagnosis. Although useful for research, a diagnosis using a collection of paired acute and convalescent sera to demonstrate a significant rise in antibody titer to HRSV can not be made in time to guide care of the patient. On top of that, the antibody level does not always correlate with the acuteness or activity level of the infection.\\r\\nRSV infection can be confirmed using tests for antigens or antibodies, or viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR. Quantification of viral load can be determined by various assay tests.\\r\\nAs the virus is ubiquitous in all parts of the world, avoidance of infection is not possible.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, palivizumab (brand name Synagis manufactured by MedImmune), a moderately effective prophylactic drug, is available for infants at high risk. Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against RSV surface fusion protein. It is given by monthly injections, which are begun just prior to the RSV season and are usually continued for five months. HRSV prophylaxis is indicated for infants that are premature or have either cardiac or lung disease, but the cost of prevention limits use in many parts of the world.[medical citation needed]\\r\\nTo date, treatment has been limited to supportive measures. Adrenaline, bronchodilators, steroids, antibiotics, and ribavirin confer \\"no real benefit\\".[14][15]\\r\\nStudies of nebulized hypertonic saline have shown that the \\"use of nebulized 3% HS is a safe, inexpensive, and effective treatment for infants hospitalized with moderately severe viral bronchiolitis\\" where \\"respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for the majority of viral bronchiolitis cases\\".[16][17] One study noted a 26% reduction in length of stay: 2.6 I 1.9 days, compared with 3.5 I 2.9 days in the normal-saline treated group (p=0.05).[16]\\r\\nSupportive care includes fluids and oxygen until the illness runs its course. Salbutamol may be used in an attempt to relieve any bronchospasm if present. Increased airflow, humidified and delivered via nasal cannula, may be supplied in order to reduce the effort required for respiration.[medical citation needed]\\r\\nAs of 2017 there was no vaccine for RSV despite many years of preclinical and clinical work.[18] A formalin-inactivated candidate developed in the 1960s surprisingly increased infections, which came to be known as \\"immunopotentiation\\" or vaccine-enhanced disease.[19][20]\\r\\nAs of 2017 several companies including GlaxoSmithKline and Bavarian Nordic were working on RSV vaccines.[21][22]","input":"Rsv disease is caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). rsv is a(n)?"},{"output":"Geraint Thomas","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of the Tour de France general classification winners. The Tour de France is an annual road bicycle race held over 23?days in July. Established in 1903 by newspaper L'Auto, the Tour is the most well-known and prestigious of cycling's three \\"Grand Tours\\"; the others are the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta a Espa?a.[1] The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200?mi), passing through France and neighbouring countries such as Belgium.[2] The race is broken into day-long stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The course changes every year, but has always finished in Paris; since 1975 it has finished along the Champs-lyses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day wears the yellow jersey, representing the leader of the general classification. There are other jerseys as well: the green jersey, worn by the leader of the points classification; the polka dot jersey, worn by the leader of the mountains classification; and the white jersey, worn by the leader of the young rider classification.\\r\\n\\r\\nJacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Indurain, have won the most Tours with five each. Indurain is the only man to win five consecutive Tours. Henri Cornet is the youngest winner; he won in 1904, just short of his 20th birthday. Firmin Lambot is the oldest winner, having been 36?years, 4?months old when he won in 1922.[3] French cyclists have won the most Tours; 21 cyclists have won 36?Tours among them. Belgian cyclists are second with 18?victories, and Spanish riders are third with 12?wins.[4] The most recent winner is Geraint Thomas of Team Sky, who won the 2018 Tour, his first. His team, Team Sky, have provided three of the last four individual winners, all British, between them winning six of the last seven Tours[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter it emerged that Lance Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs, in October 2012 the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) stripped Armstrong of the seven consecutive Tour general classification titles between 1999 and 2005.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tour de France was established in 1903 by newspaper L'Auto, in an attempt to increase its sales. The first race was won by Frenchman Maurice Garin. He won again the next year, but was disqualified after allegations that he had been transported by car or rail arose. Henri Cornet became the winner after the dispute was settled; he is the youngest to win the Tour. Following the scandals in 1904, the scoring system was changed from being time-based to a points-based system, in which the cyclist who has  the fewest points at the end of the race is victorious. This system lasted until 1912, when the time-based system was re-introduced. French cyclists were successful in the early Tours; the first non-Frenchman to win the Tour was Fran?ois Faber of Luxembourg, who won in 1909.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nBelgian riders were more successful before and after the First World War (which suspended the Tour from 1915 to 1918). In the 1920s, trade teams dominated the Tour; cyclists such as Nicolas Frantz won the Tour with the Alcyon team. However, when Alcyon cyclist Maurice De Waele won the Tour in 1929 while ill, the organisers decided to introduce national teams the following year, to stop team tactics from undermining the race. Because of the Second World War, the Tour de France was suspended from 1940 to 1946.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Second World War, no one dominated the Tour until Louison Bobet, who won three consecutive Tours from 1953 to 1955he was the first person to achieve this feat.[10] This was bettered by the French cyclist Jacques Anquetil, who won four successive Tours from 1961 to 1964. Anquetil, who also won in 1957, became the first to win five Tours.[11] Anquetil's five victories were matched when Belgian cyclist Eddy Merckx won four successive Tours from 1969 to 1972 and the 1974 Tour. Merckx is the only person to have won the general, points and king of the mountains classifications in the same Tour. He achieved this in 1969, when he won his first Tour.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nMerckx looked to be heading for a record sixth Tour victory in 1975, but Bernard Thvenet beat him, becoming the first French winner in seven years. Thvenet won again in 1977; however, he was eclipsed in following years by fellow Frenchman Bernard Hinault, who won consecutive Tours in 1978 and 1979. Hinault won the Tour at his first attempt in 1978; becoming one of 11 cyclists (including Anquetil, Merckx, Hugo Koblet and Fausto Coppi) managed to do so.[13] In 1980, Hinault was going for a third consecutive win, but had to pull out because of tendinitis, and the Tour was won by Joop Zoetemelk.[14] Hinault returned in 1981 and won that race as well as the one after that. Hinault sat out the Tour in 1983, and another FrenchmanLaurent Fignonachieved victory. Fignon won again the following year, beating Hinault; Hinault recovered in 1985 to win his fifth Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican Greg LeMond became the first non-European to win the Tour in 1986. LeMond missed out in 1987 and 1988, but returned in 1989 to win the Tour by finishing eight seconds ahead of Laurent Fignon, the smallest winning margin in the Tour's history. LeMond also won in 1990.[15] In 1991, Spaniard Miguel Indurain won his first Tour. Indurain came to dominate the Tour, winning four more Tours consecutivelymaking him the first person to win five consecutive Tours.[16] He tried to win a record-high sixth Tour in 1996, but was beaten by Bjarne Riis, who later admitted to using Erythropoietin.[17] Jan Ullrich and Marco Pantani won in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, Pantani's victory was overshadowed by doping scandals.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1999 Tour saw the first victory of Lance Armstrong,[19] which was followed by six more, for a total of seven consecutive victories.[20] He was stripped of his titles in October 2012, when it emerged he had used performance-enhancing drugs throughout much of his career, including the Tour de France victories.[7] Floyd Landis won the Tour in 2006, but was later stripped of his title, after a drug-control test demonstrated the presence of a skewed testosterone/epitestosterone ratio.[21] ܇scar Pereiro was subsequently awarded the victory. Alberto Contador won the 2007 Tour with the Discovery Channel. The 2007 Tour was also marred by doping scandals, thus Contador was unable to defend his title in 2008, as his Astana team was banned for its part. Fellow Spaniard Carlos Sastre of Team CSC won.[22] Contador and Astana returned in 2009 to regain the title. He won the Tour again in 2010, but was later stripped of his title after he was found guilty of doping. Runner-up Andy Schleck was awarded the victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nCadel Evans became the first Australian to win the Tour in 2011.[23] The following year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour.[24] Chris Froome became the second successive British winner in 2013, which was the 100th edition of the race.[25] He could not defend his title the following year, as he crashed out in stage 5, with Vincenzo Nibali winning his first Tour.[26] Froome regained the title in 2015 and then successfully defended it in 2016, the first rider in over 20 years to do so.[27] He then backed it up with a third consecutive win in 2017.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following riders have won the Tour de France on 2 or more occasions. Since the retirement of two-time winner Alberto Contador in 2017, the only active rider on the list as of that year is Chris Froome, currently with 4 wins. Contador had originally won three Tours, but was stripped of one following an anti-doping violation.[D]\\r\\n\\r\\nLance Armstrong was removed from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour victories stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO decided not to reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nA.?^ Bjarne Riis has admitted to doping during the 1996 Tour de France. The organizers of the Tour de France have stated that they no longer consider him to be the winner, although Union Cycliste Internationale has so far refused to change the official status due to the amount of time passed since his win. Jan Ullrich was placed second on the podium in Paris.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nB.?a b c d e f g h Lance Armstrong was declared winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, in October 2012 he was stripped of all titles by the UCI due to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. The Tour director Christian Prudhomme had previously declared that if this happened, there would be no alternate winners for those years, but this has not yet been made official.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nC.?a b Floyd Landis was the winner at the podium ceremony in Paris on the last day of the 2006 Tour, but subsequently was found to have tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during stage 17 of the race.

She rose to prominence starring in Broadway musicals such as My Fair Lady (1956), playing Eliza Doolittle, and Camelot (1960), playing Queen Guinevere. In 1957, Andrews starred in the premiere of Rodgers and Hammerstein's written-for-television musical Cinderella, a live, network broadcast seen by over 100 million viewers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews made her feature film debut in Mary Poppins (1964), and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the title role. She starred in The Sound of Music (1965), playing Maria von Trapp, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ÿ Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. Between 1964 and 1986, she starred in The Americanization of Emily (1964), Hawaii (1966), Torn Curtain (1966), Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967), Star!

In 2002, she was ranked #59 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. In 2003, she revisited her first Broadway success, this time as a stage director, with a revival of The Boy Friend. From 2001 to 2004, Andrews starred in The Princess Diaries (2001), The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). From 2004 to 2010, she lent her voice to the Shrek animated films and Despicable Me (2010).\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews has won an Academy Award, a BAFTA, five Golden Globes, three Grammys, two Emmys, the Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award, the Kennedy Center Honors Award, and the Disney Legends Award. Apart from her musical career, she is also an author of children's books and has published an autobiography, Home: A Memoir of My Early Years (2008).\\r\\n\\r\\nJulia Elizabeth Wells[2] was born on 1 October 1935 in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England.[3][4] Her mother, Barbara Ward Wells (ne Morris; 1910ÿ1984) was born in Chertsey[5] and married Edward Charles \\"Ted\\" Wells (1908ÿ1990), a teacher of metalwork and woodwork in 1932.[6] However, Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend. Andrews discovered her true parentage from her mother in 1950,[7][8] although it was not publicly disclosed until her 2008 autobiography.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Barbara and Ted Wells went their separate ways and were soon divorced. Each remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1943,[10] and Ted Wells, in 1944,[11] to Winifred Maud (Hyde) Birkhead, a war widow and former hairstylist working a lathe at a war work factory that employed them both in Hinchley Wood, Surrey.[7][8][12] Ted Wells assisted with evacuating children to Surrey during the Blitz, while Barbara joined Ted Andrews in entertaining the troops through the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA).\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews lived briefly with Ted Wells and her brother John[13] in Surrey. In 1940, Ted Wells sent young Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, who, the elder Wells thought, would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to her 2008 autobiography Home, while Julie had been used to calling Ted Andrews \\"Uncle Ted\\", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as \\"Pop\\", while her father remained \\"Dad\\" or \\"Daddy\\" to her. Julie disliked this change.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Andrews family was \\"very poor and we lived in a bad slum area of London,\\" Andrews recalled, adding, \\"That was a very black period in my life.\\" According to Andrews, her stepfather was violent and an alcoholic.[9] Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews fitting a lock on her door.[9] But, as the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford to move to better surroundings, first to Beckenham and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews' hometown of Hersham. The Andrews family took up residence at the Old Meuse, in West Grove, Hersham, a house (now demolished) where Andrews' maternal grandmother had served as a maid.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews' stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as ArtsEd), an independent arts educational school in London, then with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. \\"She had an enormous influence on me\\", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, \\"She was my third mother?ÿ I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world.\\" In her memoir Julie Andrews ÿ My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records: \\"The range, accuracy, and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch\\"[14] (though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home).[7][15] According to Andrews: \\"Madame was sure that I could do Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was\\".[16] Of her own voice, she says \\"I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range ÿ dogs would come for miles around.\\"[16] After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1945, and for the next two years, Julie Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents. \\"Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening,\\" Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to sing into the microphone, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. \\"It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right.\\"[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Andrews gained her big break when her stepfather introduced her to Val Parnell, whose Moss Empires controlled prominent venues in London. Andrews made her professional solo debut at the London Hippodrome singing the difficult aria \\"Je suis Titania\\" from Mignon as part of a musical revue called \\"Starlight Roof\\" on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year.[7][20] Andrews recalled: \\"Starlight Roof\\" saying, \\"There was this wonderful American person and comedian, Wally Boag, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 November 1948, Julie Andrews (aged 13) became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a Royal Command Variety Performance before King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at the London Palladium, where she performed along with Danny Kaye, the Nicholas Brothers, and the comedy team George and Bert Bernard.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nJulie Andrews followed her parents into radio and television.[24] She performed in musical interludes of the BBC Light Programme comedy show Up the Pole and later Educating Archie, of which she was a cast member from 1950 to 1952.[23] She reportedly made her television dbut on the BBC programme RadiOlympia Showtime on 8 October 1949.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews appeared on West End theatre at the London Casino, where she played one year each as Princess Badroulbadour in Aladdin and the egg in Humpty Dumpty. She also appeared on provincial stages in Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood, as well as starring as the lead role in Cinderella.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1952, she voiced Princess Zeila in the English dub of the Italian animated movie The Singing Princess (La Rosa di Bagdad, 1949), in her first film and first venture into voice-over work.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 30 September 1954 on the eve of her 19th birthday, Julie Andrews made her Broadway debut portraying Polly Browne in the already highly successful London musical The Boy Friend.[1] To the critics, Andrews was the stand-out performer in the show.[27] Near the end of her Boy Friend contract, as a Londoner Andrews was asked to audition for the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady on Broadway and got the part.[28] In November 1955, Andrews was signed to appear with Bing Crosby in what one source calls the first made-for-television film, High Tor, which aired on the Ford Star Jubilee in March 1956.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews auditioned for a part in the Richard Rodgers musical Pipe Dream. Although Rodgers wanted her for Pipe Dream, he advised her to take the part in the Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner musical My Fair Lady if it were offered to her. In 1956, she appeared on stage in My Fair Lady as Eliza Doolittle to Rex Harrison's Henry Higgins. Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews' talent that concurrent with her run in My Fair Lady she was featured in the Rodgers and Hammerstein television musical, Cinderella.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nCinderella was broadcast live on CBS on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini and had an estimated 107?million viewers.[30][31] The show was broadcast in colour from CBS Studio 72, at 2248 Broadway in New York City. Only a black-and-white kinescope remains, which has been released on DVD. Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award for her performance.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, Andrews released her debut solo album, The Lass with the Delicate Air, which harked back to her British music hall days.[33] The album includes performances of English folk songs as well as the World War II anthem, \\"London Pride\\", a patriotic song written by No?l Coward in 1941 during the Blitz, which Andrews herself had survived.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1956 and 1962, Andrews guest-starred on The Ed Sullivan Show (15 July 1956), and also appeared on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, What's My Line?, The Jack Benny Program, The Bell Telephone Hour and The Garry Moore Show. In June 1962, Andrews co-starred in Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall, a CBS special with Carol Burnett.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1960, Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as Queen Guinevere in Camelot, along with Richard Burton (as King Arthur) and newcomer Robert Goulet. However, because film studio head Jack L. Warner decided Andrews lacked sufficient name recognition for her casting in the film version of My Fair Lady, Eliza was instead played by the established film actress Audrey Hepburn. As Warner later recalled, the decision was easy, \\"In my business, I have to know who brings people and their money to a cinema box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop.\\"[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1963, Andrews began her work in the title role of Disney's musical film Mary Poppins. Walt Disney had seen her performance as Queen Guinevere and thought she would be perfect for the role of the British nanny who is \\"practically perfect in every way!\\" Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, returning to London to give birth, but Disney firmly insisted, saying, \\"We'll wait for you.\\"[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Poppins became the biggest box-office draw in Disney history. Andrews won the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ÿ Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. She and her co-stars also won the 1965 Grammy Award for Best Album for Children. As a measure of \\"sweet revenge,\\" as Poppins songwriter Richard M. Sherman put it, Andrews closed her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes by saying, \\"And, finally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie and who made all this possible in the first place, Mr. Jack Warner.\\"[36][37] My Fair Lady was in direct competition for the awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews starred opposite James Garner in The Americanization of Emily (1964), for which she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. A comedy-drama war film set in London during World War II, Andrews has described it as her favourite film, a sentiment shared by her co-star Garner.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, Andrews starred in The Sound of Music, which was the highest-grossing film of the year. It was also the biggest hit in the history of 20th Century Fox.[39] In 2013, it was the third highest-grossing film of all time in the US, adjusted for inflation.[40] For her performance as Maria von Trapp, Andrews won her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ÿ Motion Picture Comedy or Musical. She was nominated a second time for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, though in both awards she lost to Julie Christie, for Darling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing The Sound of Music, Andrews appeared as a guest star on the NBC-TV variety series The Andy Williams Show. She followed this television appearance with an Emmy Award-winning special, The Julie Andrews Show, which featured Gene Kelly and the New Christy Minstrels as guests. It aired on NBC-TV in November 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, Andrews starred in Hawaii, the second highest-grossing film of its year. Also in 1966, she starred opposite Paul Newman in Torn Curtain, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The following year, she played the title character in Thoroughly Modern Millie (1967), for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. At the time, Thoroughly Modern Millie and Torn Curtain were the biggest and second biggest hits in Universal Pictures history, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews next appeared in two of Hollywood's most expensive flops: Star! (1968), a biopic of Gertrude Lawrence; and Darling Lili (1970), co-starring Rock Hudson and directed by her second husband, Blake Edwards. In 1970, Andrews was the first choice to play the English witch Eglantine Price in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks, with the role eventually going to Angela Lansbury.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews continued working in television. In 1969, she shared the spotlight with singer Harry Belafonte for an NBC-TV special, An Evening with Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. In 1971, she appeared as a guest for the Grand Opening Special of Walt Disney World, and that same year she and Carol Burnett headlined a CBS special, Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center. In 1972ÿ73, Andrews starred in her own television variety series, The Julie Andrews Hour, on the ABC network. The show won seven Emmy Awards but was cancelled after one season.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1973 and 1975, Andrews continued her association with ABC by headlining five variety specials for the network. She guest-starred on The Muppet Show in 1977,[42] and the following year, she appeared again with the Muppets on a CBS television variety special. The programme, Julie Andrews: One Step Into Spring, aired in March 1978, to mixed reviews and mediocre ratings. She made only two other films in the 1970s, The Tamarind Seed (1974) and 10 (1979).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1980, Andrews headlined \\"Because We Care\\", a CBS-TV special with 30 major stars raising funds for Cambodian Famine victims through Operation California (now Operation USA, on whose Board she serves). Later that year, she starred in the film Little Miss Marker. In 1981, she appeared in Blake Edwards' S.O.B. (1981) in which she played Sally Miles, a character who agrees to \\"show my boobies\\" in a scene in the film-within-a-film. That was Andrews's first on-screen nude scene and got much attention as she poked fun at her own squeaky-clean image.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982, Andrews played a dual role of Victoria Grant and Count Victor Grezhinski in the film Victor/Victoria once again playing opposite James Garner. Her performance earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ÿ Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, as well as a nomination for the 1982 Academy Award for Best Actress, her third Oscar nomination.[1][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, Andrews was chosen as the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year by the Harvard University Theatrical Society.[44] That year, she co-starred with Burt Reynolds in The Man Who Loved Women. Her next two films were That's Life! and Duet for One (both 1986), which earned her Golden Globe nominations.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1987, Andrews starred in an ABC Christmas special, Julie Andrews: The Sound Of Christmas, which went on to win five Emmy Awards. Two years later, she was reunited for the third time with Carol Burnett for a variety special which aired on ABC in December 1989.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1991, Andrews made her television dramatic debut in the ABC made-for-TV film, Our Sons, co-starring Ann-Margret. Andrews was named a Disney Legend within the year. In the summer of 1992, Andrews starred in her first television sitcom, the short-lived Julie aired on ABC for only seven episodes and co-starred James Farentino. In December 1992, she hosted the NBC holiday special, Christmas In Washington.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, she starred in a limited run at the Manhattan Theatre Club in the American premiere of Stephen Sondheim's revue, Putting It Together. Between 1994 and 1995 Andrews recorded two solo albums?ÿ the first saluted the music of Richard Rodgers and the second paid tribute to the words of Alan Jay Lerner. In 1995, she starred in the stage musical version of Victor/Victoria. It was her first appearance in a Broadway show in 35 years. Opening on Broadway on 25 October 1995 at the Marquis Theatre, it later went on the road for a world tour. When she was the only Tony Award nominee for the production, she declined the nomination saying that she could not accept because she felt the entire production was snubbed.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews was forced to quit the show towards the end of the Broadway run in 1997 when she developed hoarseness in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat.[1] (However, Andrews has recently stated that it was due to \\"a certain kind of muscular striation [that] happens on the vocal cords\\" as a result of strain from Victor/Victoria, adding \\"I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.\\"[46]) She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999 she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 \\"it's been two years, and it [her singing voice] still hasn't returned.\\"[47] The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews admits that she has never recovered from the botched attempt to remove nodules from her vocal cords back in 1997. Her famous, four-octave soprano was then reduced to a fragile alto ÿ she was quoted at the time as saying \\"I can sing the hell out of \\"Old Man River.\\"[49]\\r\\n\\r\\n Subsequently, from 2000 onwards, Steven M. Zeitels, director of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Center for Laryngeal Surgery and Voice Rehabilitation, operated on her four times and while able to improve her speaking voice, was unable to restore her singing.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the loss of her singing voice, she kept busy with many projects. In 1998, she appeared in a stage production of Dr. Dolittle in London. As recounted on the Julie Andrews website, she performed the voice of Polynesia the parrot and \\"recorded some 700 sentences and sounds, which were placed on a computer chip that sat in the mechanical bird's mouth. In the song 'Talk to the Animals,' Polynesia the parrot even sings.\\" The next year Andrews was reunited with James Garner for the CBS made-for-TV film, One Special Night, which aired in November 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2000 New Year Honours List, Andrews was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for services to the performing arts by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.[51][52] In 2002, Andrews was among the guests at the Queen's Golden Jubilee Hollywood party held at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.[53] She also appears at No.59 on the 2002 poll of the \\"100 Greatest Britons\\" sponsored by the BBC and chosen by the British public.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Andrews received Kennedy Center Honors. The same year, she reunited with Sound of Music co-star Christopher Plummer in a live television performance of On Golden Pond (an adaptation of the 1979 play).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Andrews appeared in The Princess Diaries, her first Disney film since Mary Poppins (1964). She starred as Queen Clarisse Marie Renaldi and reprised the role in a sequel, The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004). In The Princess Diaries 2, Andrews sang on film for the first time since having throat surgery. The song, \\"Your Crowning Glory\\" (a duet with teen idol Raven-Symon), was set in a limited range of an octave to accommodate her recovering voice.[55] The film's music supervisor, Dawn Soler, recalled that Andrews \\"nailed the song on the first take. I looked around and I saw grips with tears in their eyes.\\"[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews continued her association with Disney when she appeared as the nanny in two television films based on the Eloise books, a series of children's books by Kay Thompson about a child who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Eloise at the Plaza premiered in April 2003, and Eloise at Christmastime was broadcast in November 2003; Andrews was nominated for an Emmy Award.[32] The same year she made her debut as a theatre director, directing a revival of The Boy Friend, the musical in which she made her 1954 Broadway debut, at the Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, New York. Her production, which featured costume and scenic design by her former husband Tony Walton, was remounted at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2005 and went on a national tour in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2005 to 2006, Andrews served as the Official Ambassador for Disneyland's 18-month-long, 50th-anniversary celebration, the \\"Happiest Homecoming on Earth\\", travelling to promote the celebration, and recording narration and appearing at several events at the park. On 17 March 2005, Andrews appeared onstage during the curtain calls for the musical of Mary Poppins at the Prince Edward Theatre in London's West End, where she gave a speech recalling her own memories from making the film and praised the cast for their new interpretation.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Andrews performed the voice of Queen Lillian in the animated blockbuster Shrek 2 (2004), reprising the role for its sequels, Shrek the Third (2007) and Shrek Forever After (2010). Later, in 2007, she narrated Enchanted, a live-action Disney musical comedy that both poked fun at and paid homage to classic Disney films such as Mary Poppins.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 1, 2005, Disneyland debuted a new fireworks show, Remember... Dreams Come True, for Disneylands 50th anniversary, with Andrews being the host and narrator of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2007, Andrews was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Screen Actors Guild's awards and stated that her goals included continuing to direct for the stage and possibly to produce her own Broadway musical.[43] She published Home: A Memoir of My Early Years, which she characterised as \\"part one\\" of her autobiography, on 1 April 2008. Home chronicles her early years in Britain's music hall circuit and ends in 1962 with her winning the role of Mary Poppins. For a Walt Disney video release, she again portrayed Mary Poppins and narrated the story of The Cat That Looked at a King in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July through early August 2008, Andrews hosted Julie Andrews' The Gift of Music, a short tour of the United States[57] where she sang various Rodgers and Hammerstein songs and symphonised her recently published book, Simeon's Gift. These were her first public singing performances in a dozen years, due to her failed vocal cord surgery.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, Andrews was named on The Times list of the top 10 British Actresses of all time. The list included Helen Mirren, Helena Bonham Carter, Judi Dench, and Audrey Hepburn.[59] On 8 May 2009, Andrews received the honorary George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Achievement in Music at the annual UCLA Spring Sing competition in Pauley Pavilion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2010, Andrews was the official United States presenter for the Great Performances From Vienna: The New Year's Celebration 2010 concert.[60] This was her second appearance in this role, after presenting the previous year's concert.[61] Andrews also had a supporting role in the film Tooth Fairy, which opened to unfavourable reviews[62] although the box office receipts were successful.[63] On her promotion tour for the film, she also spoke of Operation USA and the aid campaign to the Haiti disaster.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 May 2010, Andrews made her London comeback after a 21-year absence (her last performance there was a Christmas concert at the Royal Festival Hall in 1989). She performed at The O2 Arena, accompanied by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and an ensemble of five performers.[65] Earlier (on 15 December 2009 and on many other occasions), she appeared on British television saying that rumours that she would be singing at the performance were not true and that she would be doing a form of \\"speak singing\\".[66] Yet she actually sang two solos and several duets and ensemble pieces. The evening, though well received by the 20,000 fans present, who gave her standing ovation after standing ovation,[67] did not convince the critics.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 18 May 2010, Andrews' 23rd book (this one also written with her daughter Emma) was published. In June 2010 the book, entitled The Very Fairy Princess, reached number 1 on the New York Times Best Seller List for Children's Books.[69] On 21 May 2010, her film Shrek Forever After was released; in it Andrews reprises her role as the Queen.[70] On 9 July 2010, Despicable Me, an animated film in which Andrews lent her voice to Marlena Gru, the thoughtless and soul-crushing mother of the main character Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), opened to rave reviews[71] and strong box office.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 28 October 2010, Andrews appeared, along with the actors who portrayed the cinematic von Trapp family members, on Oprah to commemorate the film's 45th anniversary.[73][74] A few days later, her 24th book, Little Bo in Italy, was published.[75] On 15 December 2010, Andrews' husband Blake Edwards died at the age of 88, of complications of pneumonia at the Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Andrews was by her husband's side when he died.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2011, Andrews received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and, with her daughter Emma, a Grammy for best spoken-word album for children (for A Collection of Poems, Songs and Lullabies), at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[77][78]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 77, Andrews undertook her first tour of Australia and New Zealand in 2013, hosted by Nicholas Hammond[79] who was a boy of 14 when they appeared together in The Sound of Music.[49] In place of singing, she planned a series of speaking engagements in Australia's five mainland state capitals.[80]  The following year she took the show on a tour of England, which was hosted by Aled Jones. The tour began with a May date at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham and included an appearance at the Echo Arena in Liverpool.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Andrews made a surprise appearance at the Oscars, greeting Lady Gaga who paid her homage by singing a medley from The Sound of Music.[82] This became a social media sensation, trending all over the world.[83] Lyndon Terracini announced in August 2015 that Andrews would direct My Fair Lady in 2016 for Opera Australia at the Sydney Opera House.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, Andrews created the preschool television series Julie's Greenroom with her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton and Judy Rothman. Andrews is joined by her assistant Gus (Giullian Yao Gioiello) and Greenies, a cast of original puppets built by The Jim Henson Company. The series premiered on Netflix in 2017.[85] In 2017, Andrews also reprised her role as Marlena Gru in the second Despicable Me sequel Despicable Me 3.[86][87]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews has been married twice, first to set designer Tony Walton from 1959 until 1967, then to director Blake Edwards from 1969 until his death in 2010.[23][88][89]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews married Walton on 10 May 1959 in Weybridge, Surrey. They had first met in 1948 when Andrews was appearing at the London Casino in the show Humpty Dumpty. In September of 1962 Andrews and Walton returned to London, where their daughter Emma Katherine Walton was born two months later.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews married Edwards in 1969; his children from a previous marriage, Jennifer and Geoffrey, were 3 and 5 years older than Emma.[91] In the 1970s, Edwards and Andrews adopted two daughters; Amy in 1974 and Joanna in 1975.[92][93] Andrews is a grandmother to nine[94] and great-grandmother to three.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nTermed \\"Britains Youngest Prima Donna\\",[96] Andrews' classically trained soprano,[97] lauded for its \\"pure and clear\\" sound,[98] has been described as light, bright and operatic in tone. When a young Andrews was taken by her parents to be examined by a throat specialist, the doctor concluded that she had \\"an almost adult larynx.\\"[99] In spite of the fact that her voice teacher, English soprano Lilian Stiles-Allen, continually encouraged her to pursue opera, Andrews herself felt that her voice was unsuited for the genre and \\"too big a stretch\\". At the time, Andrews described her own voice as \\"extremely high and thin\\", feeling that it lacked \\"the necessary guts and weight for opera\\", preferring musical theatre instead. As Andrews aged, so did her voice, which began to naturally deepen. Losing her vast upper register, her \\"top notes\\" became increasingly difficult to sing while \\"her middle register matured into the warm golden tone\\" for which she has become known, according to Tim Wong of The Daily Telegraph.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nMusically, Andrews had always preferred singing music that was \\"bright and sunny\\", choosing to avoid songs that were sad, depressing, upsetting, or written in a minor key, for fear of losing her voice \\"in a mess of emotion\\". She cited this as yet another reason for avoiding opera.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: The year given is the year of the ceremony\\r\\n\\r\\nAndrews has received many honorary degrees in recognition of her distinguished career in entertainment.

In 1946, with the birth of the Italian Republic (Repubblica Italiana), the Regia Marina changed its name to Marina Militare (\\"Military Navy\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina was established on 17 March 1861 following the proclamation of the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states in the Italian peninsula, so the Regia Marina was formed from the navies of those states, though the main constituents were the navies of the former kingdoms of Sardinia and Naples. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, both sail- and steam-powered, and the long naval traditions of its constituents, especially those of Sardinia and Naples, but also suffered from some major handicaps.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, it suffered from a lack of uniformity and cohesion; the Regia Marina was a heterogeneous mix of equipment, standards and practice, and even saw hostility between the officers from the various former navies. These problems were compounded by the continuation of separate officer schools at Genoa and Naples, and were not fully addressed until the opening of a unified Naval Academy at Livorno in 1881.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, unification occurred during a period of rapid advances in naval technology and tactics, as typified by the launch of Gloire by France in 1858, and later by the appearance of, and battle between, USS?Monitor and CSS?Virginia in 1862. These innovations quickly made older warships obsolete. Italy did not possess the shipyards or infrastructure to build the modern ships required, but the then Minister for the Navy, Admiral Carlo di Persano, launched a substantial programme to purchase warships from foreign yards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new navy's baptism of fire came on 20 July 1866 at the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence (parallel to the Seven Weeks War). The battle was fought against the Austrian Empire and occurred near the island of Vis in the Adriatic sea. This was one of the few fleet actions of the nineteenth century, and as a major sea battle that involved ramming, it had a profound, though with hindsight a detrimental, effect on warship design and tactics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian fleet, commanded by Admiral Persano, mustered 12 ironclad and 17 wooden-hulled ships, though only one, Affondatore, was of the most modern turret ship design. Despite a marked disadvantage in numbers and equipment, superior handling by the Austrians under Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff resulted in a severe defeat for Italy, which lost two armoured ships and 640 men.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, the Regia Marina passed through some difficult years as the naval budget was substantially reduced, thus impairing the fleet's efficiency and the pace of new construction; only in the 1870s, under Simone Pacoret de Saint Bon's ministry, did the situation begin to improve. In 1881, the battleship Caio Duilio was commissioned, followed in 1882 by the battleship Enrico Dandolo; at the time these were the most powerful warships in the world, and signalled the Italian fleet's renewed power. In 1896 the corvette Magenta completed a circumnavigation of the world. The following year the Regia Marina conducted experiments with Guglielmo Marconi in the use of radio communications. 1909 saw the first use of aircraft with the fleet. An Italian naval officer, Vittorio Cuniberti, was the first in 1903 to envision in a published article the all-big gun battleship design, which would be later come to be known as dreadnought.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1911 and 1912, the Regia Marina was involved in the Italo-Turkish War against forces of the Ottoman Empire. As the majority of the Ottoman fleet stayed behind the relative safety of the Dardanelles, the Italians dominated the Mediterranean during the conflict winning victories against Ottoman light units at the Prevenza and the Battle of Beirut. In the Red Sea the Italian forces were vastly superior to those of the Ottomans who only possessed a squadron of gunboats there. These were destroyed while attempting to withdraw into the Mediterranean at the Battle of Kunfuda Bay.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore 1914, the Kingdom of Italy built six dreadnought battleships: (Dante Alighieri as a prototype; Giulio Cesare, Conte di Cavour and Leonardo da Vinci of the Conte di Cavour class; and Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio of the Andrea Doria class), but they did not participate in major naval actions in World War I, as they were positioned to intercept a major sortie of the Austro-Hungarian Navy which never came.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the war, the Regia Marina spent its major efforts in the Adriatic Sea, fighting the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The resulting Adriatic Campaign of World War I consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian coastal bombardments of Italy's Adriatic coast, and wider-ranging German/Austro-Hungarian submarine warfare into the Mediterranean. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the German/Austro-Hungarian navies in the Adriatic, which was successful in regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines, which found safe harbours and easy passage into and out of the area for the whole of the war. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare of World War I, it nonetheless tied down significant forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most of the war the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies each kept a relatively passive watch over their adversaries. The Italian fleet lost the pre-dreadnought battleship Benedetto Brin at Brindisi (27 September 1915) and the dreadnought Leonardo da Vinci at Taranto (2 August 1916) due to a magazine explosion (although there were rumours of Austrian sabotage). In the last part of the war, the Regia Marina developed new weapons: the MAS boats, that sank the Austro-Hungarian battleship SMS?Szent Istvn in the Adriatic Sea on 10 June 1918; and an early type of human torpedo (Mignatta) entered the harbour of Pula and sank the Austro-Hungarian flagship SMS?Viribus Unitis on 1 November 1918 shortly after the entire Austro-Hungarian Navy was turned over to the newly founded neutral State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The battleship SMS?Tegetthoff (sister of the former two) was handed over to Italy as a war prize in 1919.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the interwar years the Italian government set about modernizing the Regia Marina in a way that could enable it to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea. Italian naval construction was limited by the Washington Naval Conference. The 1922 treaty required a parity in naval forces between the Italian and French navies, with equality in total displacement in battleships and carriers. The treaty influenced the development of the Italian fleet over the years between the two world wars. Between the late twenties and early thirties a construction program began, focusing first on cruisers up to 10,000 tons, followed by the building of destroyers and submarines, and lastly the construction of the new Littorio-class battleships; plans were also put in place to modernize the Conte di Cavour-class and Andrea Doria-class battleships. Much of these new naval units were responses to French naval constructions, as the Marine nationale was seen until the mid 1930s as the most likely enemy in a hypothetical conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. In theory this would allow them to engage or break off at their own choosing, and would allow them to hit the enemy when he could not yet hit back. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts of similar caliber. Speed was emphasized in their new construction. Italian cruisers built in the 1920s, such as the Giovanni dalle Bande Nere were built with a newly designed and relatively thin armour.. This would have a decisive role in a number of naval battles, including the Battle of Cape Spada. Later classes, such as the Zara and Montecuccoli classes, were built to a more balanced design with thicker armor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modernization work on the four Great War era battleships turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. The ship's guns were upgraded in main armament, going from 13 guns of 305 mm diameter, to 10 guns of 320 mm diameter. The middle turret and the vessel's central tower were eliminated. To increase speed the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers and ten meters were added to the ship's length to improve the coefficient of fineness. Though the ships were improved, they still were not an equal match for the Queen Elizabeth-class battleships and the Renown-class battlecruisers, both of which carried larger guns and heavier armour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough scientific research on tracking devices such as radar and sonar was being conducted in Italian universities and military laboratories by men such as Ugo Tiberio and Guglielmo Marconi, the conservative Italian leadership had little interest in these new technologies, and did not use them to improve the effectiveness of the Italian vessels. This was mainly due to the influence of Admiral Domenico Cavagnari, whom Mussolini appointed as Chief of Staff of the Navy in 1933, and whom he later promoted to Secretary of the Navy. Likewise technological advancement in radio range finders and gunnery control devices for night combat were not incorporated. Regarding such devices, Cavagnari emphasized \\"not wanting traps in your way\\". Writing to Admiral Iachino, he wrote \\"..procedere con estrema cautela nell'accettare brillanti novit tecniche che non siano ancora collaudate da una esperienza pratica sufficientemente lunga..\\", which can be translated to \\"... proceed with extreme caution regarding brilliant technical innovations that have not yet been tested or with which there is no practical experience.\\"  Thus, the Italian navy entered the Second World War with a marked technical inferiority to the British Navy. German General Albert Kesselring, overall commander of Axis forces in the Mediterranean, observed that the Italian navy was \\"a good weather\\" force, unable to operate effectively at night or in heavy seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo training ships were built during this period, in addition to the effort to modernize and re-equip the combat vessels of the navy. These were square rigged school ships the Regia Marina ordered in 1925. The sailing ships followed a design by Lieutenant Colonel Francesco Rotundi of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, reminiscent of ships of the line from the Napoleonic era. The first of these two ships, Cristoforo Colombo, was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy for training until 1943. After World War II, this ship was handed over to the Soviet Union as part of war reparations and was shortly afterwards decommissioned. The second ship of the design was Amerigo Vespucci. The ship was built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia (Naples). She was launched on 22 February 1931, and was put into service in July of that year. She is still being used to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1928, the unified command of the \\"Armata Navale\\" was abolished, and the fleet was divided in two squadrons (Squadre navali), one based at La Spezia and the other based at Taranto.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina played a limited role in the invasion of Ethiopia. While the Ethiopian Empire was landlocked, the navy was instrumental in delivering and supplying the invasion forces through Somali and Eritrean ports.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Regia Marina sent naval units in support of the Italian Corps of Volunteer Troops (Corpo Truppe Volontarie). Approximately 58 Italian submarines took part in operations against Republican naval forces of Spain. These submarines were organized in a Submarine Legion and complemented German U-boat operations as part of Operation Ursula. At least two Republican freighters, one Soviet and another Panamanian were either sunk or forced to run aground by Italian destroyers near the Strait of Sicily.[1] Two light cruisers took part in the shelling of Barcelona and Valencia in 1937, resulting in the deaths of more than 30 civilians.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1939, the Regia Marina supported the invasion of Albania. All ground forces involved in the invasion had to cross the Adriatic Sea from mainland Italy and the crossings were accomplished without incident.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 June 1940, following the German invasion of France and the lowlands, the Kingdom of Italy declared war on France and the United Kingdom and entered World War II. Italy went to war with the fourth largest navy in the world.[citation needed] Italian dictator Benito Mussolini saw the control of the Mediterranean Sea as an essential prerequisite for expanding his \\"New Roman Empire\\" into Nice, Corsica, Tunis and the Balkans. Italian naval building accelerated during his tenure. Mussolini described the Mediterranean as \\"Mare Nostrum\\" (Our Sea).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the declaration of war, Italian ground and air forces prepared to strike at the beaten French forces across the border in the Italian invasion of France. By contrast, the Regia Marina prepared to secure the lines of communications between Italy, Libya and the East African colonies. The Italian High Command (Comando Supremo) did not approve of the plan devised by the Italian Naval Headquarters (Supermarina) to occupy a weakly defended Malta,[4] which proved a crucial mistake. The British, thinking Malta could not be defended due to the proximity of Italian air bases in Italy, Sicily, and Libya, had put little effort into bolstering the islands' defences. Thus, at the outset of the war there were only 42 anti-aircraft guns on the island and twelve Gloster Sea Gladiators, half sitting in crates at the wharf.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering the war, the Regia Marina was operating under a number of limitations. Though significant assets were available to challenge the Royal Navy for control of the Mediterranean, there had been a lack of emphasis on the incorporation of technological advances such as radar and sonar. This meant that in night engagements or foul weather, the Italian ships were unable to detect the approach of their British adversaries. When engaged, they could only range their guns if they were able to visually locate their targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina had six battleships with which to contend for control of the Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being re-fit at the outbreak of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the Regia Marina had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, but there were a large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training.\\r\\n\\r\\nItaly's lack of raw materials meant that they would have great difficulty building new ships over the course of the war. Thus, the assets they did have were handled with caution by Supermarina. Whereas Allied commanders at sea had a fair degree of autonomy and discretion to fight their vessels as circumstance allowed, Italian commanders were required to confer with their headquarters before committing their forces in an engagement that might result in their loss. This led to delays in arriving at decisions and actions being avoided, even when the Italians had a clear advantage. An example occurred during \\"Operation Hats\\", in which the Regia Marina had superior forces but failed to commit them to take advantage of the opportunity.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nA further key disadvantage in the convoy support and interception battles that dominated the Battle of the Mediterranean was the intelligence advantage the British held in their Ultra intercept system. Ultra decrypts provided the Royal Navy with key information on convoy routes, times of departure, time of arrival, and make up of the convoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warships of the Regia Marina had a general reputation as being well-designed. Italian small attack craft lived up to expectations and were responsible for many successful actions in the Mediterranean. Though Italian warships lacked radar, this was partly offset in fair weather by good optical rangefinder and fire-control systems.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian Navy lacked a fleet air arm. The high command had reasoned that since the Italian navy would be operating solely in the Mediterranean, their vessels would never be far from an airfield, thus the time and resources needed to develop a naval air arm could be directed elsewhere. This proved problematic on a number of occasions. Though the Italians did have the aircraft carriers Aquila and Sparviero under construction at the start of the war, neither one was ever completed.[3] Lastly, the lack of natural oil reserves and subsequent shortage of oil precluded extensive fleet operations.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina and the Royal Navy engaged in a two-and-a-half-year struggle for control of the Mediterranean. The Regia Marina's primary goal was to support the Axis forces in North Africa while obstructing the supply route to Alexandria and cutting off supplies to Malta. The Royal Navy's major effort was to maintain supply to the military forces and people of Malta, and secondarily to interdict convoy shipments to North Africa.[8][N 1]  The first major action occurred on 11 November 1940 when the British aircraft carrier HMS?Illustrious launched two waves of Swordfish torpedo-bombers in a surprise raid against the Italian Fleet moored at the naval base of Taranto. The raid came in undetected, and three battleships were sunk. Another major defeat was inflicted on the Regia Marina at Cape Matapan, where the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy intercepted and destroyed three heavy cruisers (Zara, Pola and Fiume; all of the same class) and two Oriani-class destroyers in a night ambush, with the loss of over 2,300 seamen. The Allies had Ultra intercepts, which uncovered the Italian movements, and radar, which enabled them to locate the ships and range their weapons at distance and at night. The better air reconnaissance skills of the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm and their close collaboration with surface units were other major causes of the Italian debacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 December 1941, the battleships HMS?Queen Elizabeth and HMS?Valiant were sunk in shallow water by limpet mines planted by Italian manned torpedoes, knocking both out of the conflict for almost two years. This action, coming on the heels of the loss of the Prince of Wales and Repulse in the South China Sea, significantly weakened the surface strength of the Royal Navy, making it difficult for them to challenge control of the eastern Mediterranean.[N 2]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the night of 19 December, Force K, comprising three cruisers and four destroyers based at Malta, ran into an Italian minefield off Tripoli. Three cruisers struck mines, with the cruiser HMS?Neptune lost, along with the destroyer HMS?Kandahar. In addition, another destroyer was seriously damaged. All told 800 seamen were lost, and Force K, which had been effectively interdicting Axis convoys, was put out of action. This series of successes allowed the Regia Marina to achieve naval supremacy in the central Mediterranean. Coupled with an intensive bombing campaign against Malta, the Axis supply routes from southern Europe to North Africa were almost untouched by the Royal Navy or its allies for the next several months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Italian fleet went on the offensive, blocking or mauling three large Allied convoys bound for Malta. This led to a number of naval engagements, including the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, Operation Harpoon and Operation Vigorous, (known as the \\"Battle of Mid-June\\") and Operation Pedestal (the \\"Battle of Mid-August\\"). All of these engagements were favourable to the Axis. Despite this activity, the only real success of the Italian Fleet was the surface attack on the Harpoon convoy, supported by Axis aerial forces. These attacks sank several Allied warships and damaged others. Only two transports of the original six in the convoy reached Malta. This was an undisputed squadron-sized victory for Italian surface forces in World War II.[N 3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the heavy losses suffered by the merchantmen and escorting forces of convoy Pedestal, the oil and supplies brought through allowed the near starving island of Malta to continue to hold out. With Allied landings in North Africa, Operation Torch, in November 1942, the fortunes of war turned against the Italians. Their sea convoys were harassed day after day by the aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies. The maritime lane between Sicily and Tunisia became known as the \\"route of death\\". After years of back and forth, the Axis forces were forced to surrender in Tunisia, bringing the campaign for North Africa to a close.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina performed well and bravely in its North African convoy duties, but remained at a technical disadvantage. The Italian ships relied on speed but could easily be damaged by shell or torpedo, due to their relatively thin armour. The fatal and final blow to the Italian Navy was a shortage of fuel, which forced its main units to remain at anchor for most of the last year of the Italian alliance with Germany.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 10 June 1940, submarines of the Regia Marina took part in the Battle of the Atlantic alongside the U-Boats of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. The Italian submarines were based in Bordeaux, France at the BETASOM base. While more suited for the Mediterranean Sea than the Atlantic Ocean, the thirty-two Italian submarines that operated in the Atlantic sank 109 Allied ships for a total of 593,864 tons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina even planned an attack on New York harbor with midget submarines for December 1942, but this plan was delayed for many reasons and was never carried out.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Italian forces enjoyed considerable success in East Africa. From 10 June 1940, the Regia Marina's Red Sea Flotilla, based at Massawa, Eritrea, posed a potential threat to Allied shipping crossing the Red Sea between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. This threat increased in August 1940 with the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, which allowed the Italians the use of the port of Berbera; in January 1941, however, British and Commonwealth forces launched a successful counterattack in East Africa and the threat posed by the Red Sea Flotilla disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the Red Sea Flotilla was destroyed by hostile action during the first months of war or when the port of Massawa fell in April 1941. However, there were a few survivors. In February 1941, prior to the fall of Massawa, the colonial ship Eritrea and the auxiliary cruisers Ramb I and Ramb II broke out and sailed to Kobe, Japan. While Ramb I was sunk by the New Zealand cruiser HMNZS?Leander off the Maldives, Eritrea and Ramb II made it to Kobe. As the port of Massawa was falling, four submarinesGuglielmo, Gauleo Ferraras, Perla, and Archimedesailed south from Massawa, rounded the Cape of Good Hope and ultimately sailed to German occupied Bordeaux, France. One or two Italian merchant ships from the Red Sea Flotilla made it to Vichy French-controlled Madagascar.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 June 1941 the British launched Operation Chronometer, landing a battalion of troops from the British Indian army at Assab, the last Italian-held harbour on the Red Sea.[13]  By 11 June, Assab had fallen. Two days later, on 13 June, the Indian trawler Parvati became the last naval casualty of the East African Campaign when it struck a moored mine near Assab.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 1942, at German request, the Regia Marina deployed four 24 ton anti-submarine motorboats (Motoscafo Anti Sommergibile, MAS), six CB-class midget submarines, five torpedo motorboats, and five explosive motorboats to the Black Sea. The vessels were transported overland to the Danube River at Vienna, Austria, and then transported by water to Constan?a, Romania. The flotilla had an active and successful campaign, based at Yalta and Feodosia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Italy quit the war, most of the Italian vessels on the Black Sea were transferred to Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. In early 1944, six MAS boats were transferred to the Royal Romanian Navy.[15] By August 1944, they were ultimately captured by Soviet forces when Constan?a was captured. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe five surviving midget submarines were transferred to the Royal Romanian Navy.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina operated a squadron of four MAS boats on Lake Ladoga during the Continuation War (1941ÿ1944). As part of Naval Detachment K, German, Italian, and Finnish vessels operated against Soviet gunboats, escorts and supply vessels during the Siege of Leningrad between 21 June and 21 October 1942. The Italian vessels were ultimately turned over to Finland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Regia Marina had a naval base in the concession territory of Tiensin in China. The primary Italian vessels based in China were the mine-layer Lepanto and the gunboat Carlotto. During World War II, Italian supply ships, auxiliary cruisers and submarines operated throughout the waters of the Far East, often in disguise.[citation needed] The Italians also utilized Japanese-controlled port facilities such as Shanghai, China, and Kobe, Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven Italian submarines operating from France were converted by the Italians into \\"transport submarines\\" in order to exchange rare or irreplaceable trade goods with Japan. The submarines Alpino Bagnolini, Barbarigo, Comandante Cappellini, Giuseppe Finzi, Reginaldo Giuliani, Enrico Tazzoli, and Luigi Torelli were converted for service with the Monsun Gruppe (\\"Monsoon Group\\"). The name of Comandante Cappellini was changed to Aquila III.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwelve additional R-class blockade running transport submarines were specifically designed for trade with the Far East, but only two of these vessels were completed before Italy quit the war. Both of these submarines were destroyed by Allied action almost as soon as they were launched.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1943, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was deposed and the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. Under the terms of this armistice, the Regia Marina had to sail its ships to an Allied port. Most sailed to Malta, but a flotilla from La Spezia headed towards Sardinia. This was intercepted and attacked by German aircraft and the battleship Roma was sunk by two hits from Fritz X guided glide-bombs. Among the 1600 sailors killed on board Roma was the Italian Naval Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Carlo Bergamini.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs vessels became available to the new Italian government, the Italian Co-Belligerent Navy was formed to fight on the side of the Allies. Other ships were captured in port by the Germans or scuttled by their crews. Few Regia Marina crews chose to fight for Mussolini's new fascist regime in northern Italy, the Italian Social Republic (Repubblica Sociale Italiana, RSI). Mussolini's pro-German National Republican Navy (Marina Nazionale Repubblicana) hardly reached a twentieth the size attained by the co-belligerent Italian fleet.[22]  In the Far East, the Japanese occupied the Italian concession territory of Tiensin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little use for the surrendered Italian battleships and there was doubt about the loyalties of the crews, so these ships were interned in Egypt. In June 1944, the less powerful battleships (Andrea Doria, Caio Duilio and Giulio Cesare) were allowed to return to Augusta harbour in Sicily for training. The others, Vittorio Veneto and Italia (ex-Littorio), remained at Isma?lia in the Suez Canal until 1947. After the war, Giulio Cesare was passed to the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Co-belligerency period, until \\"VE\\" (Victory in Europe) Day, Italian light cruisers participated in the naval war in the Atlantic Ocean with patrols against German raiders. Smaller naval units (mainly submarines and torpedo boats) served in the Mediterranean Sea. In the last days of war, the issue of whether Italian battleships and cruisers should participate in the Pacific War was debated by the Allied leaders.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were also Italian naval units in the Far East in 1943 when the new Italian government agreed to an armistice with the Allies. The reactions of their crews varied greatly. In general, surface units, mainly supply ships and auxiliary cruisers, either surrendered at Allied ports (Eritrea at Colombo, Ceylon) or, if in Japanese controlled ports, they were scuttled by their own crew (Conte Verde, Lepanto, and Carlotto at Shanghai). Ramb II was taken over by the Japanese in Kobe and renamed Calitea II. Four Italian submarines were in the Far East at the time of the armistice, transporting rare goods to Japan and Singapore: Ammiraglio Cagni, Comandante Cappellini (Aquilla III), Reginaldo Giuliani, and Luigi Torelli. The crew of Ammiraglio Cagni heard of the armistice and surrendered to the Royal Navy off Durban, South Africa. Comandante Cappellini, Reginaldo Giuliani, and Luigi Torelli and their crews were temporarily interned by the Japanese. The boats passed to German U-boat command and, with mixed German and Italian crews, they continued to fight against the Allies. The German navy assigned new officers to the three submarines. The three were renamed UIT-23, UIT-24 and UIT-25 and took part in German war operations in the Pacific. Reginaldo Giuliani was sunk by the British submarine HMS?Tally-Ho in February 1944. In May 1945, the other two vessels were taken over by the Japanese Imperial Navy when Germany surrendered. About twenty Italian sailors continued to fight with the Japanese. Luigi Torelli remained active until 30 August 1945, when, in Japanese waters, this last Fascist Italian submarine shot down a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber of the United States Army Air Forces.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of hostilities, the Regia Marina started a long and complex rebuilding process. At the beginning of the war, the Regia Marina was the fourth largest navy in the world with a mix of modernised and new battleships. The important combat contributions of the Italian naval forces after the signing of the armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943 and the subsequent cooperation agreement on 23 September 1943 left the Regia Marina in a poor condition. Much of its infrastructure and bases were unusable and its ports mined and blocked by sunken ships. However, a large number of its naval units had survived the war, albeit in a low efficiency state. This was due to the conflict and the age of many vessels.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vessels that remained were:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 June 1946, the Italian monarchy was abolished by a popular referendum. The Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia) ended and was replaced by the Italian Republic (Repubblica Italiana). The Regia Marina became the Navy of the Italian Republic (Marina Militare).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 February 1947, a peace treaty was signed in Paris between the Italian Republic and the victorious powers of World War II. The treaty was onerous for the Italian Navy.

Under French control 1682 to 1762 and 1802 (nominally) to 1803, the area was named in honor of King Louis XIV, by French explorer Ren-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. It originally covered an expansive territory that included most of the drainage basin of the Mississippi River and stretched from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Appalachian Mountains to the Rocky Mountains.\\r\\nLouisiana included two regions, now known as Upper Louisiana (French: la Haute-Louisiane), which began north of the Arkansas River, and Lower Louisiana (French: la Basse-Louisiane). The U.S. state of Louisiana is named for the historical region, although it is only a small part of the vast lands claimed by France.[1]\\r\\nFrench exploration of the area began during the reign of Louis XIV, but French Louisiana was not greatly developed, due to a lack of human and financial resources. As a result of its defeat in the Seven Years' War, France was forced to cede the east part of the territory in 1763 to the victorious British, and the west part to Spain as compensation for Spain losing Florida. France regained sovereignty of the western territory in the secret Third Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800. But strained by obligations in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte sold the territory to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, ending France's presence in Louisiana.\\r\\nThe United States ceded part of the Louisiana Purchase to the United Kingdom in the Treaty of 1818. This section lies above the 49th parallel north in a part of present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 18th century, Louisiana included most of the Mississippi River basin (see drawing alongside) from what is now the Midwestern United States south to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Within this vast territory, only two areas saw substantial French settlement: Upper Louisiana (French: Haute-Louisiane), also known as the Illinois Country (French: Pays des Illinois), which consisted of settlements in what are now the states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana; and Lower Louisiana, which comprised parts of the modern states of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Alabama. Both areas were dominated numerically by Native American tribes. At times, fewer than two hundred [French] soldiers were assigned to all of the colony, on both sides of the Mississippi. In the mid-1720s, Louisiana Indians numbered well over 35,000, forming a clear majority of the colony's population.\\"[2]\\r\\nGenerally speaking, the French colony of Louisiana bordered the Great Lakes, particularly Lake Michigan and Lake Erie towards the north; this region was the \\"Upper Country\\" of the French province of Canada. To the east was territory disputed with the British colonies on the Atlantic seaboard; the French claim extended to the Appalachian Mountains. The Rocky Mountains marked the western extent of the French claim, while Louisiana's southern border was the Gulf of Mexico.\\r\\nThe general flatness of the land aided movement through the territory; its average elevation is less than 1,000 metres (3,300?ft).[citation needed] The topography becomes more mountainous towards the west, with the notable exception of the Ozark Mountains, which are located in the mid-south.\\r\\nLower Louisiana consisted of lands in the Lower Mississippi River watershed, including settlements in what are now the U.S. states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The French first explored it in the 1660s, and a few trading posts were established in the following years; serious attempt at settlement began with the establishment of Fort Maurepas, near modern Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699. A colonial government soon emerged, with its capital originally at Mobile, later at Biloxi and finally at New Orleans (in 1722, four years after the city's founding). The government was led by a Governor-general, and Louisiana became an increasingly important colony in the early 18th century.\\r\\nThe earliest settlers of Upper Louisiana mostly came from French Canada, but Lower Louisiana was colonized by people from all over the French colonial empire, with various waves coming from Canada, France, and the French West Indies.[3]\\r\\nUpper Louisiana, also known as the Illinois Country, was the French territory in the upper Mississippi River Valley, including settlements and fortifications in what are now the states of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana.[4] French exploration of the area began with the 1673 expedition of Louis Joliet and Jacques Marquette, which charted the upper Mississippi. As noted above, Upper Louisiana was primarily settled by colonists from French Canada.[3] There was further substantial intermarriage and integration with the local Illinois peoples.[5] French settlers were attracted by the availability of arable farmland as well as by the forests, abundant with animals suitable for hunting and trapping.[6]\\r\\nBetween 1699 and 1760, six major settlements were established in Upper Louisiana: Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Fort de Chartres, Saint Philippe, and Prairie du Rocher, all on the east side of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois; and Ste. Genevieve across the river in today's Missouri.[7] The region was initially governed as part of Canada, but was declared to be part of Louisiana in 1712, with the grant of the Louisiana country to Antoine Crozat.[8] By the 1720s a formal government infrastructure had formed; leaders of the towns reported to the commandant of Fort de Chartres, who in turn reported to the Governor-general of Louisiana in New Orleans.[9]\\r\\nThe geographical limits of Upper Louisiana were never precisely defined, but the term gradually came to describe the country southwest of the Great Lakes. A royal ordinance of 1722 may have featured the broadest definition: all land claimed by France south of the Great Lakes and north of the mouth of the Ohio River, which would include the Missouri Valley as well as both banks of the Mississippi.[10]\\r\\nA generation later, trade conflicts between Canada and Louisiana led to a defined boundary between the French colonies; in 1745, Louisiana governor general Vaudreuil set the northeastern bounds of his domain as the Wabash valley up to the mouth of the Vermilion River (near present-day Danville, Illinois); from there, northwest to le Rocher on the Illinois River, and from there west to the mouth of the Rock River (at present-day Rock Island, Illinois).[10] Thus, Vincennes and Peoria were the limit of Louisiana's reach. The outposts at Ouiatenon (on the upper Wabash near present-day Lafayette, Indiana), Chicago, Fort Miamis (near present-day Fort Wayne, Indiana), and Prairie du Chien operated as dependencies of Canada.[10]\\r\\nThis boundary remained in effect through the capitulation of French forces in Canada in 1760 until the Treaty of Paris in 1763, after which France surrendered its remaining territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Although British forces had occupied the \\"Canadian\\" posts in the Illinois and Wabash countries in 1761, they did not occupy Vincennes or the Mississippi River settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia until 1764, after the peace treaty was ratified.[11]) As part of a general report on conditions in the newly conquered Province of Canada, Gen. Thomas Gage (then commandant at Montreal) explained in 1762 that, although the boundary between Louisiana and Canada was not exact, it was understood that the upper Mississippi (above the mouth of the Illinois) was in Canadian trading territory.[12]\\r\\nFollowing the transfer of power (at which time many of the French settlers on the east bank of the Mississippi crossed the river to what had become Spanish Louisiana) the eastern Illinois Country became part of the British Province of Quebec, and later the United States' Northwest Territory.[13] Those fleeing from British control founded outposts such as the important settlement of St. Louis (1764). This became a French fur-trading center, connected to trading posts on the Missouri and Upper Mississippi rivers, leading to later French settlement in that area.\\r\\nIn the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau, France ceded Louisiana west of the Mississippi River to Spain, its ally in the war, as compensation for the loss of Spanish Florida to Britain.[14] Even after France had lost its claim to Louisiana, settlement of Upper Louisiana by French-speakers continued for the next four decades. French explorers and frontiersmen, such as Pedro Vial, were often employed as guides and interpreters by the Spanish and later by the Americans. The Spanish lieutenant governors at St. Louis maintained the traditional \\"Illinois Country\\" nomenclature, using titles such as \\"commander in chief of the western part and districts of Illinois\\" and administrators commonly referred to their capital St. Louis \\"of the Ylinuses\\".[10]\\r\\nIn 1800 Spain returned its part of Louisiana to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso, but France sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.[15] Through this time, but especially following the Louisiana Purchase, French Creoles, as they called themselves, began to move further into the Missouri Ozarks, where they formed mining communities such as Mine  Breton and La Vieille Mine (Old Mines).[7]\\r\\nA unique dialect, known as Missouri French, developed in Upper Louisiana. It is distinguished from both Louisiana French and the various forms of Canadian French, such as Acadian. The dialect continued to be spoken around the Midwest, particularly in Missouri, through the 20th century. It is nearly extinct today, with only a few elderly speakers still able to use it.[3]\\r\\nIn 1660, France started a policy of expansion into the interior of North America from what is now eastern Canada. The objectives were to locate a Northwest Passage to China; to exploit the territory's natural resources, such as fur and mineral ores; and to convert the native population to Catholicism. Fur traders began exploring the pays d'en haut (upper country around the Great Lakes) at the time. In 1659, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Mdard Chouart des Groseilliers reached the western end of Lake Superior. Priests founded missions, such as the Mission of Sault Sainte Marie in 1668. On May 17, 1673, Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette began the exploration of the Mississippi River, which they called the Sioux Tongo (the large river) or Michissipi. They reached the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then returned upstream, having learned that the great river ran toward the Gulf of Mexico, not toward the Pacific Ocean as they had presumed. In 1675, Marquette founded a mission in the Native American village of Kaskaskias on the Illinois River. A permanent settlement was made by 1690.\\r\\nIn 1682, Cavelier de La Salle and the Italian Henri de Tonti descended to the Mississippi delta. They left Fort Crvecoeur on the Illinois River, accompanied by 23 Frenchmen and 18 Indians. They built Fort Prud'homme (later the city of Memphis) and claimed French sovereignty on the whole of the valley, which they called Louisiane in honor of the Louis XIV of France. They sealed alliances with the Quapaw Indians. In April 1682, they arrived at the mouth of the Mississippi. La Salle eventually returned to Versailles, where he convinced the Minister of the Marine to grant the command of Louisiana to him. He claimed that Louisiana was close to New Spain by drawing a map showing the Mississippi as much farther west than it really was.\\r\\nWith four ships and 320 emigrants, La Salle set sail for Louisiana. La Salle did not find the river's mouth in the Mississippi River Delta and tried to establish a colony on the Texas coast. La Salle was assassinated in 1687 by members of his exploration party, reportedly near what is now Navasota, Texas.\\r\\nIt was not easy for an absolute monarchy to administer Louisiana, a territory several times larger than Metropolitan France. Louis XIV and his successors tried to impose their absolutist ambitions on the colony, often without giving the colonial administration enough financial means to do its work.\\r\\nIf the leaders of Ancien Rgime took control of, and sometimes encouraged, the colonization of New France, it was for many reasons. The reign of Henry IV gave an important impetus to the colonisation of New France. Henry IV, the first Bourbon king, was personally interested in foreign affairs. In the 17th century, the ministers Richelieu and later Colbert advanced colonial politics. Louis XIV and his ministers were worried about the size of the kingdom, over which they constantly competed with other European nations. European rivalry and a game of political alliances greatly marked the history of Louisiana, in direct and indirect ways. Within those shifting conditions, the French desire to limit British influence in the New World was a constant in royal politics.\\r\\nLouis XIV took care to limit the appearance of intermediary bodies and countervailing powers in North America. He did not want an assembly of notables or parliament. In the 1660s, the colony was royal property. In 1685, Louis XIV banned all publishing in New France. Between 1712 and 1731, the French possession came under the control of Antoine Crozat, a rich businessman, then under that of the Mississippi Company (created by John Law), which recruited immigrants to settle the colony. In 1731, Louisiana reverted to royal rule.\\r\\nIn contrast to Metropolitan France, the government applied a single unified law of the land: the Custom of Paris for civil law (rather egalitarian for the time); the Code Louis, consisting of the 1667 ordinance on civil procedure[18] and 1670 ordinance on criminal procedure; the 1673 Code Savary for trade; and the 1685 Code noir for slavery.[19] This served as an equaliser for a while; riots and revolts against authority were rare. But, the centralised government had difficulty maintaining communications over the long distance and sailing time that separated France from Louisiana. Toward the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 18th, the colonists on the Gulf of Mexico were left almost completely to fend for themselves; they counted far more on the assistance of the Native Americans than on France. The distance had its advantages: the colonists smuggled goods into the colony with impunity.\\r\\nJean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's Minister of the Navy and Trade, was eager to stuff the coffers of the Crown. He dissolved the trading companies and took care to increase the production of the country and the colonies. Being a mercantilist, he believed it was necessary to sell as much as possible and to reduce reliance on imports. He imposed a French monopoly on trade. Colbert wanted to reduce the expenditure of the monarchy. It was, however, necessary to invest much money and to mobilize important human resources retain the American colony. Much work was done on the economic infrastructure (factories, ports) in metropolitan France, but the investment was not enough in Louisiana. No plan to facilitate the movement of goods or men was ever carried out. The French budget was exhausted because of the wars in Europe, but the colonists in Louisiana did not have to pay royal taxes and were free of the hated gabelle.\\r\\nUnder the Ancien Rgime, Louisiana formed part of a larger colonial unit, French American territoryNew France (Nouvelle France), which included a large part of modern-day Canada. New France was initially ruled by a viceroy in 1625, the Duke of Ventadour. The colony was then given a government like the Bourbons' other possessions. Its capital was Quebec city until 1759. A governor general, assisted by a single intendant, was charged with ruling this vast region. In theory, Louisiana was subordinate to Canada, and so it was explored and settled chiefly by French-Canadians rather than colonists from France. Given the enormous distance between New Orleans and Quebec, communications outside cities and forts were limited.\\r\\nFrench settlements were widely dispersed, which afforded them de facto autonomy. The government decided to break up governance of the vast varied colony of New France into five smaller provinces, including Louisiana. The Illinois Country, south of the Great Lakes, was added to Louisiana in 1717 and became known as Upper Louisiana. Mobile served as French Louisiana's first \\"capital\\". The seat of government moved to Biloxi in 1720, and then to New Orleans in 1722, where the governor lived. While the office of governor general was the most eminent, it was not the most powerful. His was a military position that required him to lead the troops and maintain diplomatic relations. The second provincial authority was the commissaire-ordonnateur. His was a civil post with similar functions as that of the intendants in France: the king's administrator and representative, he oversaw justice, the police force, and finances. He managed the budget, set prices, presided the Superior Council (Conseil suprieurthe court of justice), and organized the census. Appointed by the king, Louisiana's commissaire-ordonnateur had broad powers that sometimes conflicted with those of the governor general. The military outposts of the hinterland were directed by commanders.\\r\\nThe French possessions of North America were under the authority of a single Catholic diocese, whose seat was in Quebec. The archbishop, named and paid by the king, was spiritual head of all New France. With loose religious supervision, the fervor of the population was very weak; Louisianans tended to practice their faith much less than did their counterparts in France and Canada. The tithe, a tax by the clergy on the congregations, produced less revenue than in France.\\r\\nThe Church nevertheless played an important part in the exploration of French Louisiana; it sent missions, primarily carried out by Jesuits, to convert Native Americans. It also founded schools and hospitals: by 1720, the Ursulines were operating a hospital in New Orleans. The church and its missionaries established contact with the numerous Amerindian tribes. Certain priests, such as Father Marquette in the 17th century, took part in exploratory missions. The Jesuits translated collections of prayers into numerous Amerindian languages to convert the Native Americans. They also looked for ways to relate Indian practices to Christian worship, and helped show the Natives how these were related. A syncretic religion developed among new Christians. Sincere and permanent conversions were limited in number; many who received missionary instruction tended to assimilate the Holy Trinity into their belief of \\"spirits\\", or rejected the concept outright.\\r\\nIt is difficult to estimate the total population of France's colonies in North America. While historians have relatively precise sources regarding the colonists and enslaved Africans, estimates of Native American peoples is difficult. During the 18th century, the society of Louisiana became quite creolized.\\r\\nFurther information: Colonial French Colonial French (commonly known as Colonial Louisiana French) is a variety of Louisiana French. It is associated with the misnomer the Cajun French dialect and with Louisiana Creole French, a related creole language. Spoken widely in what is now the U.S. state of Louisiana, it is now considered to have been relabeled as \\"Cajun French\\".\\r\\nColonial French is conventionally described as the form of French spoken in Lower French Louisiana prior to the mass arrival of Acadians after the Great Upheaval of the mid-18th century, which resulted in the birth of the Cajun dialect. The prestige dialect still used by Creoles and Cajuns is often identified as deriving from Colonial French, but some linguists differentiate between the two, referring to the latter as Plantation Society French.\\r\\nHistorically spoken by Louisiana Creole population in lower French Louisiana, Colonial French is generally considered to have been adopted by whites, blacks and Cajuns. It is known among the educated that it has been incorrectly relabelled \\"Cajun French\\" by Cajuns and CODOFIL.\\r\\nFollowing the Great Upheaval in 1764, when many Acadians were exiled to French Louisiana, Louisiana French was adopted by the Acadians. Some scholars suggested that it survived as the prestige dialect spoken by Creoles, both white and of color, into the 21st century. There are populations of Creoles and Cajuns among other ethnic groups in the parishes of St. Martin, Avoyelles, Iberia, Pointe-Coupe, St. Charles, St. Landry, St. Mary, St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and other parishes south of Orleans, that still speak this prestige dialect.\\r\\nHowever, linguists have pointed out this prestige dialect is distinct from the pre-Upheaval Colonial French, and is largely derived from the standard French of the mid-19th century, Spanish, African languages, and Native Americans languages. As such, in 1998 linguist Michael Picone of the University of Alabama introduced the term \\"Plantation Society French\\" for the prestige dialect. There is a history of diglossia between Plantation Society French and Louisiana Creole French. Plantation Society French, at any rate, is quite close to the Standard French of the time of its origin, with some possible differences in pronunciation and vocabulary use.\\r\\nIt is still spoken by the Louisiana Indians, such as the Houmas, Avoyelles, Choctaw, and other tribal remnants, all present in pre-Acadian Louisiana and still present in contemporary Louisiana.\\r\\nAccording to the demographer Russel Thornton, North America contained approximately seven million native inhabitants in 1500. The population plummeted from the 16th century onward, primarily because of the new infectious diseases carried by Europeans, to which the Native Americans had no acquired immunity. At the end of the 17th century, there were likely no more than 100,000 to 200,000 Native Americans in Lower Louisiana. French colonists forced a small number of Native Americans into slavery, in spite of official prohibition. These slaves were persons who had been captured by rival tribes during raids and in battle, and sold to French colonists. At the time, many were sent to Saint Domingue in the West Indies for sale as slaves, or to Canada. In Louisiana, planters generally preferred using African slaves, though some had Native American servants.\\r\\nIn 1717, John Law, the French Comptroller General of Finances, decided to import African slaves into Louisiana. His objective was to develop the plantation economy of Lower Louisiana. The Royal Indies Company held a monopoly over the slave trade in the area. It imported approximately 6,000 slaves from Africa between 1719 and 1743. A small portion of these were sent to the Illinois Country to cultivate the fields or to work the lead mines. The economy of Lower Louisiana consequently became slave-dependent. As in other French colonies, the treatment of the slaves was regulated by the Code Noir. The slaves often had a degree of autonomy beyond that suggested by the code. Initially, during public holidays, slaves were permitted to sell a portion of the crops they had cultivated. Some would hunt, cut wood or keep livestock far from the plantation. Lastly, although interracial marriages and regroupings of slaves were prohibited, planters often kept slave mistresses. The life and work of the slaves was difficult, with the intense harvest season and processing of sugar undoubtedly the hardest. The maintenance of canals for rice irrigation and travel also involved much labor.\\r\\nSlave residences and furnishings as supplied by planters were modest. The slaves were given simple straw pallets as beds. They typically had some trunks and kitchen utensils. The condition of the slaves depended on the treatment they received from their masters. When it was excessively cruel, the slaves often fled and hid in the marshes or in New Orleans. The Maroon societies that runaway slaves founded were often short-lived; Louisiana did not have the larger and semi-permanent Maroon villages that developed in the West Indies. Meanwhile, slave revolts were not as frequent in this area as they were in the Caribbean. The possibility of being set free was rather low; the slaves could not purchase their freedom. One of the first slaves to be freed was Louis Congo, who, in 1725, received freedom, land, and compensation in exchange for becoming the public executioner of New Orleans.[20] Some freed slaves (notably women and former soldiers) formed small communities, which suffered from segregation; justice was more severe against them, and they did not have right to possess weapons. Slaves contributed to the creolization of Louisianan society. They brought okra from Africa, a plant common in the preparation of gumbo. While the Code Noir required that the slaves receive a Christian education, many secretly practiced animism and often combined elements of the two faiths.\\r\\nThe commonly accepted definition of Louisiana Creole today is the community whose members are a descendant of the \\"native-born\\" individuals of la Louisiane. Some individuals may not have each ethnic heritage, and some may have additional ancestries. It is estimated that 7,000 European immigrants settled in Louisiana during the 18th centurya number 100 times lower than the number of British colonists on the Atlantic coast. Initially, creole was the term used for Europeans (and sometimes, separately for Africans) born in Louisiana, in contrast to those who immigrated there.\\r\\nLouisiana attracted considerably fewer French colonists than did its West Indian colonies. After the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, which lasted several months, the colonists had several challenges ahead of them. Their living conditions were difficult: uprooted, they had to face a new, often hostile, environment. Many of these immigrants died during the maritime crossing or soon after their arrival. Physical conditions were harsh, and the tropical climate was difficult for colonists. Hurricanes, unknown in France, periodically struck the coast, destroying whole villages. The Mississippi River Delta was plagued with periodic floods and yellow fever epidemics, to which malaria and cholera were added as part of the Eurasian diseases that arrived with the Europeans. These conditions slowed colonization.\\r\\nMoreover, French villages and forts were not necessarily safe from enemy offensives. Attacks by Native Americans represented a real threat to the groups of isolated colonists; in 1729, their attacks killed 250 in Lower Louisiana. Forces of the Native American Natchez people took Fort Rosalie (now Natchez, Mississippi) by surprise, killing, among others, pregnant women. The French responded with warfare during the next two years: some Natchez were captured and deported as slaves to Saint Domingue; others left the area if they escaped.\\r\\nColonists were often young men, volunteers recruited in French ports or in Paris. Many served as indentured servants; they were required to remain in Louisiana for a length of time fixed by the contract of service to pay off their passage. During this time, they were \\"temporary semi-slaves\\". To increase the colonial population, the Crown sent filles  la cassette (\\"casket girls,\\" referring to the small trunks they arrived with), young Frenchwomen, to marry the soldiers. They were given a dowry financed by the King. This practice built upon the 17th-century precedent when Louis XIV paid for transport and dowries for about 800 filles du roi (King's Daughters) to emigrate to New France to encourage marriage and formation of families in the colony.\\r\\nBy contrast, comfort women were described as those women \\"of easy virtue\\", vagrants or outlaws, and those without family, who arrived in Louisiana with a lettre de cachet; they were sent by force to the colony, especially during the Rgence period early in the reign of Louis XV. Their stories inspired the novel Story of the Knight Of Grieux and Manon Lescaut, written by Abb Prvost in 1731. In 1721, the ship La Baleine carried nearly 90 women of childbearing age to Louisiana; they were recruited from the Paris prison of La Salpetrire. Most quickly found husbands among the residents of the colony. These women, many of whom were most likely prostitutes or felons, were known as The Baleine Brides.[21]\\r\\nCommunities of Swiss and German peoples also settled in French Louisiana, but royal authorities always referred to the population as \\"French\\". After the Seven Years' War, in which Britain defeated France, the settlement attracted a variety of groups: Spanish settlers, refugees from Saint Domingue (particularly after 1791 when the slave uprisings began), opponents of the French Revolution, and Acadians. In 1785, 1633 people of Acadian origin were brought from France to New Orleans, 30 years after having been expelled from their homeland by the British. Other Acadians were transported there by the British after they were expelled from Acadia. About 4000 are thought to have settled in Louisiana, gradually forming the Cajun community.\\r\\nSocial mobility was easier in America than in France at the time. The seigneurial system was not imposed on the banks of the Mississippi, although the long lot land division scheme of the seigneurial system was adapted to some of the meandering rivers and bayous there. There were few corporations treated hierarchically and strictly regulated. Certain tradesmen managed to build fortunes rather quickly. The large planters of Louisiana were attached to the French way of life: they imported wigs and clothing fashionable in Paris. In the Country of Illinois, the wealthiest constructed stone-built houses and had several slaves. The largest traders mostly wound up settling in New Orleans.\\r\\nThe King sent the army in the event of conflict with the other colonial powers; in 1717, the colony of Mississippi counted 300 soldiers out of 550 people (Havard G, Vidal C, History of French America, p.?225.). However, the colonial army, like that of France, suffered from desertions. Certain soldiers fled to become coureurs de bois. There were few mutinies because repression was severe. The army held a fundamental place in the control of the territory. Soldiers built forts and frequently negotiated with the Native Americans.\\r\\nThe coureurs des bois (literally \\"runners of the woods\\") played an important part, though not well documented, in the expansion of French influence in North America. By the end of the 17th century, these adventurers had journeyed the length of the Mississippi River. They were motivated by the hope of finding gold or of carrying out a profitable fur trade with the Indians. The fur trade, often practiced without authorization, was a difficult activity, carried on most of the time by young unmarried men. Many ultimately wished to go on to more sedentary agricultural activities. Meanwhile, a good number of them were integrated into native communities, learned the languages, and took native wives. A well-known example is the French Canadian Toussaint Charbonneau, husband to Sacagawea, who gave birth to Jean-Baptiste. They took part in the Lewis and Clark Expedition in 1804ÿ1806.\\r\\nAncien Rgime France wished to make Native Americans subjects of the king and good Christians, but the distance from Metropolitan France and the sparseness of French settlement prevented this. In official rhetoric, the Native Americans were regarded as subjects of the King of France, but in reality, they were largely autonomous due to their numerical superiority. The local authorities (governors, officers) did not have the means of imposing their decisions, and often compromised. The tribes offered essential support for the French in Louisiana: they ensured the survival of the colonists, participated with them in the fur trade, and were used as guides in expeditions. Their alliance was also essential in the fight against the British.\\r\\nThe two peoples influenced each other in many fields: the French learned the languages of the natives, who bought European goods (fabric, alcohol, firearms, etc.), and sometimes adopted their religion. The coureurs des bois and the soldiers borrowed canoes and moccasins. Many of them ate native food such as wild rice and various meats, like bear and dog. The colonists were often dependent on the Native Americans for food. Creole cuisine is the heir of these mutual influences: thus, sagamit, for example, is a mix of corn pulp, bear fat and bacon. Today jambalaya, a word of Seminole origin, refers to a multitude of recipes calling for meat and rice, all very spicy. Sometimes shamans succeeded in curing the colonists thanks to traditional remedies (application of fir tree gum on wounds and Royal Fern on a rattlesnake bite).\\r\\nMany colonists both admired and feared the military power of the Native Americans, but others scorned their culture and regarded them as racially less pure than the Whites. In 1735, interracial marriages without the approval of the authorities were prohibited in Louisiana. The Jesuit priests were often scandalized by the supposedly libertine ways of the Native Americans. In spite of some disagreements (the Indians killed pigs, which devastated corn fields), and sometimes violent confrontations (Fox Wars, Natchez uprisings, and expeditions against the Chicachas), the relationship with the Native Americans was relatively good in Louisiana. French imperialism was expressed through some wars and the slavery of some Native Americans. But most of the time, the relationship was based on dialogue and negotiation.\\r\\nThis comparatively sparsely-settled northern area of French Louisiana was formerly the southern part of French Canada, and was transferred in 1717 by order of the King. It lies along the Mississippi and its tributaries, and was primarily devoted to grain and cereals agriculture. The French farmers lived in villages (such as near Fort de Chartres (the colonial administrative center), Kaskaskia, Prairie du Rocher, and Sainte-Genevive). They cultivated the land with paid and slave laborers, producing mostly corn and wheat. The fields were cleared with ploughs. They raised horses, cows and pigs, and also grew a little tobacco, hemp, flax and grapes (though most wine was still imported from France). Agriculture was seasonal and periodic flooding of the Mississippi took its toll on these communities.\\r\\nThe trading posts in the Illinois Country concentrated mostly on the fur trade. Placed at strategic points, they were modestly fortified. Only a few were made out of stone (e.g., Fort de Chartres). Like their American \\"mountain man\\" counterparts, the coureurs des bois exchanged beaverskin or deer pelts for weapons, cloth or shoddy goods, because the local economy was based on barter. The skins and fur are later sold in the forts and cities of New France. The Illinois Country also produced salt and lead, and provided New Orleans with game.\\r\\nLower Louisiana's plantation economy was based on slave labor. The owners generally had their main residence in New Orleans and entrusted the supervision of the fields to a treasurer.[citation needed]\\r\\nCrops were varied and adapted to the climate and terrain. Part of the production was intended for use by Louisianans (corn, vegetables, rice, livestock), the rest being exported to France (especially tobacco and indigo).\\r\\nNew Orleans was the economic capital of Louisiana, though it remained a village for several decades. The colonists built infrastructure to encourage trade; a canal was dug in 1723.[citation needed] The shops on the banks of the Mississippi also served as warehouses. The city exported pelts from the interior as well as agricultural products from the plantations. It was also, of course, a local hub of commerce.\\r\\nThe rare shipments from France brought food (lard, wheat...), alcohol, and various indispensable finished products (weapons, tools, cloth, and clothing). Exports remained relatively weak on the whole. New Orleans continued to sell wood, rice, and corn to the French West Indies.\\r\\nThe hostility between the French and British flared up again two years before the beginning of the Seven Years' War in Europe. In North America, the war became known as the French and Indian War. After some early victories from 1754 to 1757, thanks to help from their Native American allies, the French suffered several disastrous defeats in Canada from 1758 to 1760, culminating in the surrender of the capital city, Quebec. With the loss of Canada, defense of Louisiana became impossible.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Paris, signed on 10 February 1763, formalized the eviction of the French from North America. Canada and the east bank of the Mississippi were handed over to Great Britain (Province of Quebec (1763ÿ91)). New Orleans and the west bank of the river had been secretly given to Spain the previous year. This decision provoked the departure of a few settlers; however, the Spaniards effectively took control of their new territories, which they named Luisiana, rather late (in 1766), and there was not much Spanish immigration. To the East, the United States foresaw the conquest of the West; commercial navigation on the Mississippi was opened to Americans in 1795.\\r\\nDuring the French Revolution, Louisiana was agitated under Spanish control: certain French-speaking colonists sent petitions to the metropolis and the slaves attempted revolts in 1791 and 1795.\\r\\nThe Treaty of San Ildefonso, signed in secrecy on October 1, 1800, envisaged the transfer of Western Louisiana as well as New Orleans to France in exchange for the Duchy of Parma. However, Napoleon Bonaparte soon decided not to keep the immense territory. The army he sent to take possession of the colony was first required to put down a revolution in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti); its failure to do so, and the rupture of the Treaty of Amiens with the United Kingdom, prompted him to decide to sell Louisiana to the young United States. This was done on April 30, 1803 for the sum of 80 million francs (15 million dollars). American sovereignty was established on December 20, 1803.\\r\\nFrench colonization in Louisiana left a cultural inheritance that has been celebrated significantly in recent decades. The heritage of the French language, Louisiana Creole French, and Cajun French has been most threatened; for this reason, the CODOFIL (Council for the Development of French in Louisiana) was created in 1968. A subject of debate is the variety of French that should be taught: that of France, Canadian French, standard Louisiana French, or Cajun French. Today, many Cajun-dominated areas of Louisiana have formed associations with Acadian communities in Canada, which send French professors to re-teach the language in the schools. In 2003, 7% of Louisianans were French-speaking, though most also spoke English. An estimated 25% of the state's population has some French ancestry, carrying a number of last names of French origin (e.g., LeBlanc, Cordier, Dauthier, Dion, Menard, Pineaux, Hbert, Ardoin, Roubideaux, ).\\r\\nMany cities and villages have names of French origin. They include St. Louis, Detroit, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Lafayette, Mobile, Des Moines, St. Cloud, and Duluth. The flag and the seal of the state of Minnesota carry a French legend. The Iowa state flag uses a variation of the French national flag as its base. The flag of St. Louis has a fleur-de-lis prominently displayed. Historical festivals and commemorations point out the French presence: in 1999, Louisiana celebrated the 300th anniversary of its foundation; in 2001, Detroit did the same. In 2003, the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase was commemorated on numerous occasions as well as by a formal conference to recall its history. Certain places testify to a cultural inheritance left by the French; a prime example is the French Quarter of New Orleans. In 2015, St. Louis celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding by the French in 1764. Many French forts have been rebuilt and opened to visitors.\\r\\nA key part of Louisianan culture finds its roots in the French period: Creole songs influenced the blues and jazz. Cajun music, often sung in French, remains very much alive today. New Orleans' Carnival season, with its height on Mardi Gras Day, testifies to a long-lived Roman Catholic heritage.","input":"How did the french regain control of the louisiana territory?"},{"output":"Africa","context":"","input":"Where do most monkeys live in the world?"},{"output":"to shape a post-war peace that represented not just a collective security order but a plan to give self-determination to the liberated peoples of post-Nazi Europe","context":"The Yalta Conference, also known as the Crimea Conference and code named the Argonaut Conference, held from 4 to 11 February 1945, was the World War II meeting of the heads of government of the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union for the purpose of discussing Germany and Europe's postwar reorganization. The three states were represented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Premier Joseph Stalin, respectively. The conference convened near Yalta in Crimea, Soviet Union, within the Livadia, Yusupov, and Vorontsov Palaces.\\r\\nThe aim of the conference[1] was to shape a post-war peace that represented not just a collective security order but a plan to give self-determination to the liberated peoples of post-Nazi Europe.\\r\\nThe meeting was intended mainly to discuss the re-establishment of the nations of war-torn Europe. However, within a few short years, with the Cold War dividing the continent, Yalta became a subject of intense controversy.\\r\\nYalta was the second of three major wartime conferences among the Big Three. It was preceded by the Tehran Conference in November 1943, and was followed by the Potsdam Conference in July 1945. It was also preceded by a conference in Moscow in October 1944, not attended by President Roosevelt, in which Churchill and Stalin had carved up Europe into Western and Soviet spheres of influence.[2][3] The Potsdam Conference was attended by Stalin, Churchill (who was replaced halfway through by the newly elected British Prime Minister Clement Attlee) and Harry S. Truman, Roosevelt's successor after his death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time of the Yalta Conference, the Western forces consisting of the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the governments-in-exile of France and Belgium, led by British general Bernard Montgomery and American generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and Omar Bradley, had liberated all of France and Belgium and were advancing into Germany, leading to the Battle of the Bulge. In the east, Red Army Marshal Georgy Zhukov's forces were 65?km (40?mi) from Berlin, having already pushed back the Nazis from Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and most of Yugoslavia. By February, Germany only had loose control over the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Austria, Germany, Northern Italy, and Northern Yugoslavia.\\r\\nStalin, insisting that his doctors opposed any long trips, rejected Roosevelt's suggestion to meet at the Mediterranean.[4] He offered instead to meet at the Black Sea resort of Yalta, in the Crimea. Stalin's fear of flying also was a contributing factor in this decision.[5]\\r\\nEach of the three leaders had his own agenda for post-war Germany and liberated Europe. Roosevelt wanted Soviet support in the U.S. Pacific War against Japan, specifically for the planned invasion of Japan (Operation August Storm), as well as Soviet participation in the United Nations; Churchill pressed for free elections and democratic governments in Eastern and Central Europe (specifically Poland); and Stalin demanded a Soviet sphere of political influence in Eastern and Central Europe as an essential aspect of the USSR's national security strategy. Stalin's position at the conference was one which he felt was so strong that he could dictate terms. According to U.S. delegation member and future Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, \\"it was not a question of what we would let the Russians do, but what we could get the Russians to do.\\"[6]\\r\\nPoland was the first item on the Soviet agenda. Stalin stated that \\"For the Soviet government, the question of Poland was one of honor\\" and security because Poland had served as a historical corridor for forces attempting to invade Russia.[7] In addition, Stalin stated regarding history that \\"because the Russians had greatly sinned against Poland\\", \\"the Soviet government was trying to atone for those sins.\\"[7] Stalin concluded that \\"Poland must be strong\\" and that \\"the Soviet Union is interested in the creation of a mighty, free and independent Poland.\\" Accordingly, Stalin stipulated that Polish government-in-exile demands were not negotiable: the Soviet Union would keep the territory of eastern Poland they had already annexed in 1939, and Poland was to be compensated for that by extending its western borders at the expense of Germany. Contrasting with his prior statement, Stalin promised free elections in Poland despite the Soviet sponsored provisional government recently installed by him in Polish territories occupied by the Red Army.\\r\\nRoosevelt wanted the USSR to enter the Pacific War with the Allies. One Soviet precondition for a declaration of war against Japan was an American official recognition of Mongolian independence from China (the Mongolian People's Republic had already been the Soviet satellite state from its own beginnings in 1924, through World War II), and a recognition of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and Port Arthur (but not asking the Chinese to lease), as well as deprivation of Japanese soil (such as Sakhalin and Kuril Islands) to return to Russian custody since the Treaty of Portsmouth; these were agreed without Chinese representation, consultation or consent, with the American desire to end war early thereby reducing American casualties. Stalin agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany. Stalin pledged to Truman to keep the nationality of the Korean Peninsula intact as Soviet Union entered the war against Japan.\\r\\nFurthermore, the Soviets had agreed to join the United Nations, given the secret understanding of a voting formula with a veto power for permanent members of the Security Council, thus ensuring that each country could block unwanted decisions.\\r\\nAt the time, the Red Army had occupied Poland completely and held much of Eastern Europe with a military power three times greater than Allied forces in the West[citation needed]. The Declaration of Liberated Europe did little to dispel the sphere of influence agreements that had been incorporated into armistice agreements.\\r\\nAll three leaders ratified previous agreements about the post-war occupation zones for Germany: three zones of occupation, one for each of the three principal Allies: The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They also agreed to give France a zone of occupation, carved out of the U.S. and UK zones.\\r\\nAlso, the Big Three agreed that all original governments would be restored to the invaded countries (with the exception of France, whose government was regarded as collaborationist; Romania and Bulgaria, where the Soviets had already liquidated most of the governments;[clarification needed] and Poland whose government-in-exile was also excluded by Stalin) and that all civilians would be repatriated.\\r\\nThe Declaration of Liberated Europe is a declaration that was created by Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin during the Yalta Conference. It was a promise that allowed the people of Europe \\"to create democratic institutions of their own choice\\". The declaration pledged, \\"the earliest possible establishment through free elections governments responsive to the will of the people.\\" This is similar to the statements of the Atlantic Charter, which says, \\"the right of all people to choose the form of government under which they will live.\\" Stalin broke the pledge by encouraging Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and many more countries to construct a Communist government, instead of letting the people construct their own. The countries later became known as Stalin's Satellite Nations.[8]\\r\\nThe key points of the meeting are as follows:\\r\\nThe Big Three further agreed that democracies would be established, all liberated European and former Axis satellite countries would hold free elections and that order would be restored.[13] In that regard, they promised to rebuild occupied countries by processes that will allow them \\"to create democratic institutions of their own choice. This is a principle of the Atlantic Charter?ÿ the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live\\".[13] The resulting report stated that the three would assist occupied countries to form interim government that \\"pledged to the earliest possible establishment through free elections of the Governments responsive to the will of the people\\" and to \\"facilitate where necessary the holding of such elections.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe agreement called on signatories to \\"consult together on the measures necessary to discharge the joint responsibilities set forth in this declaration.\\" During the Yalta discussions, Molotov inserted language that weakened the implication of enforcement of the declaration.[14]\\r\\nRegarding Poland, the Yalta report further stated that the provisional government should \\"be pledged to the holding of free and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot.\\"[13] The agreement could not conceal the importance of acceding to pro-Soviet short-term Lublin government control and of eliminating language calling for supervised elections.[14]\\r\\nAccording to President Roosevelt, \\"if we attempt to evade the fact that we placed somewhat more emphasis on the Lublin Poles than on the other two groups from which the new government is to be drawn I feel we will expose ourselves to the charges that we are attempting to go back on the Crimea decision.\\" Roosevelt conceded that, in the words of Admiral William D. Leahy, the language of Yalta was so vague that the Soviets would be able to \\"stretch it all the way from Yalta to Washington without ever technically breaking it.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe final agreement stipulated that \\"the Provisional Government which is now functioning in Poland should therefore be reorganized on a broader democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leaders from Poland and from Poles abroad.\\"[13] The language of Yalta conceded predominance of the pro-Soviet Lublin Government in a provisional government, albeit a reorganized one.[14]\\r\\nBecause of Stalin's strong promises and admission of guilt over Poland, Churchill believed that he would keep his word regarding Poland, remarking \\"Poor Neville Chamberlain believed he could trust Hitler. He was wrong. But I don't think I am wrong about Stalin.\\"[16]\\r\\nAt that time, over 200,000 soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces in the West were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the Kresy region of eastern Poland including cities such as Lw܇w and Vilnius. They had been deported from Kresy to the eastern regions of Russia, or sent to Gulags when the USSR occupied this region of Poland in 1939. Two years later, when Churchill and Stalin formed an alliance against Hitler, the Kresy Poles were released from the Gulags in Siberia, formed the Anders Army and marched to Persia to create the II Corps (Poland) under British high command.\\r\\nThese Polish troops were instrumental to the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa[citation needed] and Italy, and hoped to return to their homes in Kresy in an independent and democratic Poland at the end of the War. But at Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill largely acceded to Stalin's demands to annex[17] the territory which in the Nazi-Soviet Pact he and Hitler had agreed to the Soviet Union controlling, including Kresy, and to carry out Polish population transfers (1944ÿ1946). Consequently, they in effect agreed that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their Kresy homes to the Soviet Union. In reaction, thirty officers and men from the II Corps (Poland) committed suicide.[18]\\r\\nChurchill defended his actions at Yalta in a three-day Parliament army debate starting on February 27, which ended in a vote of confidence. During the debate many MPs criticised Churchill and expressed deep reservations about Yalta and support for Poland, with 25 drafting an amendment protesting the agreement.[18] These members included: Arthur Greenwood; Sir Archibald Southby, 1st Baronet; Sir Alec Douglas-Home; James Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 3rd Earl of Ancaster and Victor Raikes.[18] After the failure of the amendment, Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford, the Member of Parliament for Norwich, resigned his seat in protest at the British treatment of Poland.[18]\\r\\nWhen the Second World War ended, a Communist government was installed in Poland. Many Poles felt betrayed by their wartime allies. Many Polish soldiers refused to return to Poland, because of the Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939ÿ1946), the Trial of the Sixteen and other executions of pro-Western Poles, particularly the former members of the AK (Armia Krajowa). The result was the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain's first mass immigration law.\\r\\nOn March 1, Roosevelt assured Congress that \\"I come from the Crimea with a firm belief that we have made a start on the road to a world of peace.\\"[19] However, the Western Powers soon realized that Stalin would not honour his promise of free elections for Poland. After receiving considerable criticism in London following Yalta regarding the atrocities committed in Poland by Soviet troops, Churchill wrote Roosevelt a desperate letter referencing the wholesale deportations and liquidations of opposition Poles by the Soviets.[19] On March 11, Roosevelt responded to Churchill, writing, \\"I most certainly agree that we must stand firm on a correct interpretation of the Crimean decision. You are quite correct in assuming that neither the Government nor the people of this country will support participation in a fraud or a mere whitewash of the Lublin government and the solution must be as we envisaged it in Yalta.\\"[20]\\r\\nBy March 21, Roosevelt's Ambassador to the USSR Averell Harriman cabled Roosevelt that \\"we must come clearly to realize that the Soviet program is the establishment of totalitarianism, ending personal liberty and democracy as we know it.\\"[21] Two days later, Roosevelt began to admit that his view of Stalin had been excessively optimistic and that \\"Averell is right.\\"[21]\\r\\nFour days later, on March 27, the Soviet Peoples Commissariat for Internal Affairs (NKVD) arrested 16 Polish opposition political leaders that had been invited to participate in provisional government negotiations.[21] The arrests were part of a trick employed by the NKVD, which flew the leaders to Moscow for a later show trial followed by sentencing to a gulag.[21][22] Churchill thereafter argued to Roosevelt that it was \\"as plain as a pike staff\\" that Moscow's tactics were to drag out the period for holding free elections \\"while the Lublin Committee consolidate their power.\\"[21] The Polish elections, held on January 16, 1947, resulted in Poland's official transformation to a communist state by 1949.\\r\\nFollowing Yalta, in Russia, when Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov expressed worry that the Yalta Agreement's wording might impede Stalin's plans, Stalin responded \\"Never mind. We'll do it our own way later.\\"[16] While the Soviet Union had already annexed several occupied countries as (or into) Soviet Socialist Republics,[23][24][25] other countries in eastern Europe that it occupied were converted into Soviet-controlled satellite states, such as the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Hungary,[26] the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic,[27] the People's Republic of Romania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Albania,[28] and later East Germany from the Soviet zone of German occupation.[29] Eventually the United States and the United Kingdom made concessions in recognizing the then Communist-dominated regions, sacrificing the substance of the Yalta Declaration, while it remained in form.[30]\\r\\nAt some point of Spring 1945, Churchill had commissioned a contingency military enforcement operation plan (war on the Soviet Union) to obtain \\"square deal for Poland\\" (Operation Unthinkable), which resulted in a May 22 report stating unfavorable success odds.[31] The report's arguments included geostrategic issues (possible Soviet-Japanese alliance resulting in moving of Japanese troops from continent to Home Islands, threat to Iran/Iraq) and uncertainties concerning land battles in Europe.[32]\\r\\nThe Potsdam Conference was held from July to August 1945, which included the participation of Clement Attlee (who had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister)[33][34] and President Harry S Truman (representing the United States after Roosevelt's death).[35] At Potsdam, the Soviets denied claims that they were interfering in the affairs of Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary.[30] The conference resulted in (1) the Potsdam Declaration regarding the surrender of Japan,[36] and (2) the Potsdam Agreement regarding the Soviet annexation of former Polish territory east of the Curzon Line, and, provisions, to be addressed in an eventual Final Treaty ending World War II, for the annexation of parts of Germany east of the Oder-Neisse line into Poland, and northern East Prussia into the Soviet Union.\\r\\nFour months after the death of Roosevelt, President Truman ordered the dropping of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.\\r\\nTaken by War Office official photographer, United Kingdom\\r\\nFrom left to right: Winston Churchill, Franklin D.

Johnson's State of the Union address to the United States Congress, a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and three days after 31 men of North Korea's KPA Unit 124 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of Pueblo and the abuse and torture of her crew during the subsequent 11-month prisoner drama became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between the western democracies, and the Soviet Union and China.\\r\\nNorth Korea stated that Pueblo deliberately entered their territorial waters 7.6 nautical miles (14?km) away from Ryo Island, and that the logbook shows that they intruded several times.[1] However, the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated.[2]\\r\\nPueblo, still held by North Korea today, officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy.[3] Since early 2013, the ship has been moored along the Potong River in Pyongyang, and used there as a museum ship at the Pyongyang Victorious War Museum.[4] Pueblo is the only ship of the U.S. Navy still on the commissioned roster currently being held captive.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on 16 April 1944, as the United States Army Freight and Passenger (FP) FP-344. The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to FS-344.[6] The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guardÿmanned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945.[7] FS-344 was placed out of service in 1954.\\r\\nFS-344 was transferred to the United States Navy on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS Pueblo (AKL-44) after Pueblo and Pueblo County, Colorado on 18 June of the same year.\\r\\nInitially, she served as a light cargo ship, but shortly after resuming service was converted to an intelligence gathering ship, or what is colloquially known as a \\"spy ship\\", and redesignated AGER-2 on 13 May 1967. \\r\\nOn 5 January 1968, Pueblo left U.S. Navy base Yokosuka, Japan, in transit to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet Navy activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from North Korea.[8] The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on Pueblo during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y.[9] AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and National Security Agency (NSA) program.[10]\\r\\nAt 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style submarine chaser passed within 4,000 yards (3.7?km) of Pueblo, which was about 15.4 nautical miles (28.5?km) southeast of Mayang-do at a position 3947'N and 12828.5'E.[11]\\r\\nIn the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing trawlers Rice Paddy 1 and Rice Paddy 2 passed within 30 yards (27?m) of Pueblo. That day, a North Korean unit made an assassination attempt in the \\"Blue House\\" executive mansion against the South Korean President Park Chung-hee, but the crew of Pueblo were not informed.[11]\\r\\nAccording to the American account, the following day, 23 January, Pueblo was approached by a submarine chaser and her nationality was challenged; Pueblo responded by raising the U.S. flag. The North Korean vessel then ordered Pueblo to stand down or be fired upon. Pueblo attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three torpedo boats appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.[11]\\r\\nThe attackers were soon joined by two MiG-21 fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on Pueblo was stored belowdecks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:\\r\\n(...) Defensive armament (machine guns) should be stowed or covered in such manner so that it does not cause unusual interest by surveyed units. It should be used only in the event of a threat to survival (...)\\r\\nand notes\\r\\nIn practice, it was discovered that, because of the temperamental adjustments of the firing mechanisms, the .50-caliber machine guns took at least ten minutes to activate. Only one crew member, with former army experience, had ever had any experience with such weapons, although members of the crew had received rudimentary instructions on the weapons immediately prior to the ship's deployment.[11]\\r\\nU.S. Navy authorities and the crew of Pueblo insist that before the capture, Pueblo was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea says the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852?m) of that limit. North Korea, however, describes a 50-nautical-mile (93?km) sea boundary even though international standards were 12 nautical miles (22?km) at the time.[12]\\r\\nThe North Korean vessels attempted to board Pueblo, but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. A submarine chaser then opened fire with a 57?mm cannon, killing one member of the crew. The smaller vessels fired machine guns into Pueblo, which then signaled compliance and began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of Pueblo's Naval Security Group Command detachment:\\r\\n(...) we had retained on board the obsolete publications and had all good intentions of getting rid of these things but had not done so at the time we had started the mission. I wanted to get the place organized eventually and we had excessive numbers of copies on board (...)\\r\\nand concludes\\r\\nOnly a small percentage of the total classified material aboard the ship was destroyed.\\r\\nRadio contact between Pueblo and the Naval Security Group in Kamiseya, Japan, had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, Seventh Fleet command was fully aware of Pueblo's situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two to three-hour delay in launching aircraft. USS?Enterprise was located 510 nautical miles (940?km) south of Pueblo, yet her four F-4B aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. Enterprise's captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.[11]\\r\\nPueblo followed the North Korean vessels as ordered, but then stopped immediately outside North Korean waters. She was again fired upon, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed. The ship was finally boarded at 05:55 UTC (2:55 pm local)[13] by men from a torpedo boat and a submarine chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once Pueblo was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier a flight by a CIA A-12 Oxcart aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa flown by pilot Ronald Layton made three high altitude high speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft's films were processed in the United States they showed Pueblo to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.[14]\\r\\nThere was dissent among government officials in the United States, regarding how to handle the situation. Congressman Mendel Rivers suggested that President Johnson issue an ultimatum for the return of Pueblo on penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator Gale McGee said the United States should wait for more information and not make \\"spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents\\".[15] According to Horace Busby, Special Assistant to President Johnson, the president's \\"reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans\\", worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.[16]\\r\\nAlthough American officials at the time assumed the seizure of Pueblo had been directed by the Soviet Union, it has emerged in recent years that North Korea acted alone and the incident actually harmed North Korea's relations with most of the Eastern Bloc.[17]\\r\\nPueblo was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew was moved twice to prisoner of war (POW) camps. The crew reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment allegedly turned worse[18] when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them \\"the finger\\" in staged propaganda photos.[19]\\r\\nCommander Lloyd M. Bucher was psychologically tortured, such as being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to \\"confess to his and the crew's transgression.\\" Bucher wrote the confession since a \\"confession\\" by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said \\"We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung\\".[20][21] (Bucher pronounced \\"paean\\" as \\"pee on.\\")[22]\\r\\nNegotiations for the release of the crew took place at Panmunjom. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the Pueblo negotiations, notes in his oral history:\\r\\nThe South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the Blue House Raid and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.[23]\\r\\nHe also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive, due to the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:\\r\\nAs one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasnt in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didnt have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.[23]\\r\\nEricson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:\\r\\nWhat we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.[23]\\r\\nFollowing an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release.[24] On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and ordered to walk south one by one across the \\"Bridge of No Return\\". Exactly eleven months after being taken prisoner, the Captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge.[25] The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature which read: \\"and this hereby receipts for eighty two crewmen and one corpse\\".[clarification needed]\\r\\nBucher and all the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy Court of Inquiry. A court-martial was recommended for Bucher and the Officer in Charge of the Research Department, Lieutenant Steve Harris for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but the Secretary of the Navy, John Chafee, rejected the recommendation, stating, \\"They have suffered enough.\\" Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.[26]\\r\\nIn 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS Pueblo incident entitled Bucher: My Story.[27] Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76. James Kell, a former sailor under his command, suggested that the injuries suffered by Bucher during his time in North Korea contributed to his death.[28]\\r\\nUSS Pueblo is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of Nampo on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy James Kelly to the capital Pyongyang. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard Pueblo was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the Taedong River near the spot that the General Sherman incident is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 Pueblo was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.[4]\\r\\nToday, Pueblo remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind USS?Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\"). Pueblo is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in Tripoli.\\r\\nReverse engineering of communications devices on Pueblo allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the late 1980s when the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of Pueblo followed soon after US Navy warrant officer John Anthony Walker introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring. It has been argued that the seizure of Pueblo was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.[29][30][31]\\r\\nDocuments released from National Archives of Romania suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.[17] Together with Blue House Raid, the Pueblo incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the Sino-Soviet split. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, Leonid Brezhnev publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.[17] In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the Pueblo incident.[32]\\r\\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the Pueblo incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a 1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene[33] in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the similar treaty they had with China, the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.[34]:12ÿ15\\r\\nGiven that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to Alexei Kosygin on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was personally invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \\"increased defense preparations\\" he had to personally attend to, sending instead his defense minister, Kim Chang-bong, who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.[34]:15ÿ18\\r\\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the United States until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward. Timeline and quotations are taken from Matter of Accountability by Trevor Armbrister.[35]\\r\\nPueblo is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea, since being moved to the Taedong River.[36] Pueblo used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the General Sherman incident took place in 1866. In late November 2012 Pueblo was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Botong river next to the new Fatherland War of Liberation Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video[37] of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013. To commemorate the anniversary of the Korean War, the ship had a new layer of paint added.[38] As of April 2015, the museum is moored and on display at the Pyongyang Victorious War Museum. Visitors are allowed to board the ship and see its secret code room and crew artifacts.[39]\\r\\nThe museum's position is 3902.26 N 12544.23 E\\r\\nDuring an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate Pueblo to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely.[40]\\r\\nFormer Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy, Jr., in Washington, D.C., awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as \\"extensive and shocking.\\"[41] The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.[42]\\r\\nPueblo has earned the following awards ÿ\\r\\nAs for the crew members, they did not receive full recognition for their involvement in the incident until decades later. In 1988, the military announced it would award Prisoner of War medals to those captured in the nations conflicts. While thousands of American prisoners of war were awarded medals, the crew members of Pueblo did not receive them. Instead, they were classified as \\"detainees\\". It was not until Congress passed a law overturning this decision that the medals were awarded; the crew finally received the medals at San Diego in May 1990.[26]\\r\\nOther conflicts:\\r\\nGeneral:\\r\\nCoordinates: 390225N 1254423E? / ?39.04028N 125.73972E? / 39.04028; 125.73972","input":"Who was president when the uss pueblo was captured by north korea?"},{"output":"crust","context":"The interior structure of the Earth is layered in spherical shells. These layers can be defined by their chemical and their rheological properties. Earth has an outer silicate solid crust, a highly viscous mantle, a liquid outer core that is much less viscous than the mantle, and a solid inner core. Scientific understanding of the internal structure of the Earth is based on observations of topography and bathymetry, observations of rock in outcrop, samples brought to the surface from greater depths by volcanoes or volcanic activity, analysis of the seismic waves that pass through the Earth, measurements of the gravitational and magnetic fields of the Earth, and experiments with crystalline solids at pressures and temperatures characteristic of the Earth's deep interior.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe force exerted by Earth's gravity can be used to calculate its mass. Astronomers can also calculate Earth's mass by observing the motion of orbiting satellites. Earths average density can be determined through gravitometric experiments, which have historically involved pendulums.\\r\\nThe mass of Earth is about 7024600000000000000?6G1024?kg.[1]\\r\\nThe structure of Earth can be defined in two ways: by mechanical properties such as rheology, or chemically. Mechanically, it can be divided into lithosphere, asthenosphere, mesospheric mantle, outer core, and the inner core. Chemically, Earth can be divided into the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core. The geologic component layers of Earth[3][not in citation given] are at the following depths below the surface:\\r\\nThe layering of Earth has been inferred indirectly using the time of travel of refracted and reflected seismic waves created by earthquakes. The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel (seismic velocity) is different in other layers. The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to Snell's law, like light bending as it passes through a prism. Likewise, reflections are caused by a large increase in seismic velocity and are similar to light reflecting from a mirror.\\r\\nThe crust ranges from 5ÿ70 kilometres (3.1ÿ43.5?mi) in depth and is the outermost layer. The thin parts are the oceanic crust, which underlie the ocean basins (5ÿ10?km) and are composed of dense (mafic) iron magnesium silicate igneous rocks, like basalt. The thicker crust is continental crust, which is less dense and composed of (felsic) sodium potassium aluminium silicate rocks, like granite. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories ÿ sial and sima (Suess,1831ÿ1914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11?km below the Conrad discontinuity (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the lithosphere. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the seismic velocity, which is most commonly known as the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing plagioclase feldspar (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a chemical discontinuity between ultramafic cumulates and tectonized harzburgites, which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been obducted onto the continental crust and preserved as ophiolite sequences.\\r\\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1G108) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are 4.4 billion (4.4G109) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least that long.[4]\\r\\nEarth's mantle extends to a depth of 2,890?km, making it the thickest layer of Earth. The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle. The upper and lower mantle are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D (pronounced dee-double-prime[5]) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is 140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 1021 and 1024 Pa{s, depending on depth.[6] In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10?3 Pa{s and that of pitch is 107 Pa{s. The source of heat that drives plate tectonics is the primordial heat left over from the planets formation as well as the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earths crust and mantle.[7]\\r\\nThe average density of Earth is 5,515?kg/m3. Because the average density of surface material is only around 3,000?kg/m3, we must conclude that denser materials exist within Earth's core. Seismic measurements show that the core is divided into two parts, a \\"solid\\" inner core with a radius of 1,220?km[8] and a liquid outer core extending beyond it to a radius of 3,400?km. The densities are between 9,900 and 12,200?kg/m3 in the outer core and 12,600ÿ13,000?kg/m3 in the inner core.[9]\\r\\nThe inner core was discovered in 1936 by Inge Lehmann and is generally believed to be composed primarily of iron and some nickel. It is not necessarily a solid, but, because it is able to deflect seismic waves, it must behave as a solid in some fashion. Experimental evidence has at times been critical of crystal models of the core.[10] Other experimental studies show a discrepancy under high pressure: diamond anvil (static) studies at core pressures yield melting temperatures that are approximately 2000?K below those from shock laser (dynamic) studies.[11][12] The laser studies create plasma,[13] and the results are suggestive that constraining inner core conditions will depend on whether the inner core is a solid or is a plasma with the density of a solid. This is an area of active research.\\r\\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about four and a half billion (4.5G109) years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called planetary differentiation (see also the iron catastrophe), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the crust. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with nickel and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as lead and uranium, either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see felsic materials). Some have argued that the inner core may be in the form of a single iron crystal.[14][15]\\r\\nUnder laboratory conditions a sample of ironÿnickel alloy was subjected to the corelike pressures by gripping it in a vise between 2 diamond tips (diamond anvil cell), and then heating to approximately 4000 K. The sample was observed with x-rays, and strongly supported the theory that Earth's inner core was made of giant crystals running north to south.[16][17]\\r\\nThe liquid outer core surrounds the inner core and is believed to be composed of iron mixed with nickel and trace amounts of lighter elements.\\r\\nRecent speculation suggests that the innermost part of the core is enriched in gold, platinum and other siderophile elements.[18]\\r\\nThe matter that comprises Earth is connected in fundamental ways to matter of certain chondrite meteorites, and to matter of outer portion of the Sun.[19][20] There is good reason to believe that Earth is, in the main, like a chondrite meteorite. Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including Francis Birch, built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called enstatite chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\\r\\nDynamo theory suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the Coriolis effect, gives rise to Earth's magnetic field. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see Curie temperature) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5?mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.[21][22]\\r\\nRecent evidence has suggested that the inner core of Earth may rotate slightly faster than the rest of the planet;[23] however, more recent studies in 2011[which?] found this hypothesis to be inconclusive. Options remain for the core which may be oscillatory in nature or a chaotic system.[citation needed] In August 2005 a team of geophysicists announced in the journal Science that, according to their estimates, Earth's inner core rotates approximately 0.3 to 0.5?degrees per year faster relative to the rotation of the surface.[24][25]\\r\\nThe current scientific explanation for Earth's temperature gradient is a combination of heat left over from the planet's initial formation, decay of radioactive elements, and freezing of the inner core.\\r\\n Media related to Structure of the Earth at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the solid outermost layer of the earth?"},{"output":"the third-season episode \\"Blood Fever\\"","context":"The Borg are a fictional alien group that appear as recurring antagonists in the Star Trek franchise. The Borg are a vast collection of \\"drones\\", or cybernetic organisms, linked in a hive mind called \\"the Collective\\" or \\"the Hive\\". The Borg co-opt the technology and knowledge of other alien species to the Collective through the process of \\"assimilation\\": forcibly transforming individual beings into drones by injecting microscopic machines, or nanoprobes, into their bodies and surgically augmenting them with cybernetic components. The Borg's ultimate goal is \\"achieving perfection\\".[1] Aside from being recurring antagonists in The Next Generation television series, they are depicted as the main threat in the film Star Trek: First Contact. In addition, they played major roles in the Voyager series and serve as the way home to the Alpha Quadrant for the isolated Federation starship USS Voyager. The first encounter between humans and the Borg is depicted in the 2nd season of the series Enterprise in the episode \\"Regeneration\\" in which the phrase 'you will be assimilated; resistance is futile' is heard by the crew of Starfleet's starship USS Enterprise for the first time.\\r\\nThe Borg have become a symbol in popular culture for any juggernaut against which \\"resistance is futile\\". TV Guide named the Borg #4 in their 2013 list of the 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the text commentary to the collector's edition of Star Trek: First Contact, Michael Okuda revealed that Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) writers began to develop the idea of the Borg as early as the Season 1 episode, \\"Conspiracy\\", which introduced a coercive, symbiotic life form that took over key Federation personnel. It was thwarted by the Enterprise crew and presumably never heard of again (the 'alien conspiracy' plotline itself was scrapped when it became clear that the concept was too grim for Star Trek's target audience).[citation needed] Plans to feature the Borg as an increasingly menacing threat were subsequently scrapped in favor of a more subtle introduction, beginning with the mystery of missing colonies on both sides of the Neutral Zone in \\"The Neutral Zone\\" and culminating in the encounter between Borg and the Enterprise crew in \\"Q Who?\\".\\r\\nThe Borg represented a new antagonist and regular enemy that was lacking during the first season of TNG; the Klingons were allies and the Romulans mostly absent. The Ferengi were originally intended as the new enemy for the United Federation of Planets, but their comical appearance and devotion to capitalist accumulation by free enterprise failed to portray them as a convincing threat. The Borg, however, with their frightening appearance, their immense power, and their sinister motive, became the signature villains for the TNG and Voyager eras of Star Trek. In Voyager episode \\"Q2\\", even Q tells his son \\"don't provoke the Borg.\\"\\r\\nIndividual Borg rarely speak, though they do send a collective audio message to their targets, stating that \\"resistance is futile\\", generally followed by a declaration that the target in question will be assimilated and its \\"biological and technological distinctiveness\\" will be added to their own. The exact phrasing varies and evolves over the various series episodes and film. One phrase, from TNG, is:\\r\\n\\"We are the Borg. Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own. Resistance is futile.\\"\\r\\nThe complete phrase used in Star Trek: First Contact, as performed by Jeff Coopwood[3] is:\\r\\n\\"We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your ships. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\\"[4]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"resistance is futile\\" became prevalent in popular culture from its use in the television show TNG.[5][6][7][8]\\r\\nThe Borg uttered the phrase in several Star Trek episodes and the film Star Trek: First Contact (which used the phrase as the tagline for the 1996 film). Patrick Stewart's delivery of the line, as Locutus, in \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" was ranked no. 93 in TV Land's list of \\"The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catchphrases\\".[9] It was used as the title for an episode of the TV series Dexter. The phrase appears in several preceding TV series, including Doctor Who episode \\"The Deadly Assassin\\" (1976), where it is used by the Master through the voice of his mouthpiece, Chancellor Goth, and on Space: 1999 (series 2, episode 24, 1976) where it was used by Maya responding to \\"The Dorcons\\", during an attack on Moonbase Alpha.[10] As well as the Borg bearing remarkable resemblance to Lord Dread and the bio-dreads of Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future, the similar phrase \\"resistance was futile\\" was used in reference to Lyman Taggert, the human who became Lord Dread.[11] This comic book also antedates the appearance of the Borg in TNG.\\r\\nThe origin of the Borg is never made clear, though they are portrayed as having existed for hundreds of thousands of years (as attested by Guinan and the Borg Queen). In Star Trek: First Contact, the Borg Queen merely states that the Borg were once much like humanity, \\"flawed and weak\\", but gradually developed into a partially synthetic species in an ongoing attempt to evolve and perfect themselves.\\r\\nIn TNG's \\"Q Who?\\", Guinan mentions that the Borg are \\"made up of organic and artificial life [...] which has been developing for [...] thousands of centuries.\\" In the later episode of Star Trek: Voyager, \\"Dragon's Teeth\\", Gedrin, of the race the Vaadwaur, says that before he and his people were put into suspended animation 892 years earlier (1482), the Borg had assimilated only a few colonies in the Delta Quadrant and were considered essentially a minor nuisance, which suggests the Borg began expansion through space only around 1,000 years ago. Now awake in the 24th century, he is amazed to see that the Borg control a vast area of the Delta Quadrant. Seven of Nine comments that the Borg's collective memories of that time period are fragmentary, though it is never established why that is.\\r\\nThe Star Trek Encyclopedia speculates that a connection could exist between the Borg and V'ger, the vessel encountered in Star Trek: The Motion Picture. In this movie, Spock states, \\"Any show of resistance would be futile, Captain,\\" which could be paraphrased as the Borg's \\"Resistance is futile\\". This idea of a connection is advanced in William Shatner's novel The Return. The connection was also suggested in a letter included in Starlog no. 160 (November 1990). The letter writer, Christopher Haviland, also speculated that the original Borg drones were members of a race called \\"the Preservers\\", which Spock had suggested in the original series episode \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\" might be responsible for why so many humanoids populate the galaxy. It was confirmed in the TNG episode \\"The Chase\\" that an ancient species seeded hundreds, if not thousands of planets with their DNA, creating the Humans, Vulcans, Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians, and many more. Coincidentally, in the novelization of Star Trek: The Motion Picture (written by Gene Roddenberry), the V'ger entity notes that the Ilia probe is resisting the programming given to it because of residual memories and feelings for Captain Decker, from its precise replication of the Deltan lieutenant. When V'ger becomes aware of this, it decides that \\"the resistance was futile, of course\\".\\r\\nThe extra section of the non-canon game Star Trek: Legacy contains the supposed \\"Origin of the Borg\\", which tells the story of V'ger being sucked into a black hole. V'ger was found by a race of living machines which gave it a form suitable to fulfilling its simplistic programming. Unable to determine who its creator could be, the probe declared all carbon-based life an infestation of the creator's universe, leading to assimilation. From this, the Borg were created, as extensions of V'ger's purpose. Drones were made from those assimilated and merged into a collective consciousness. The Borg Queen was created out of the necessity for a single unifying voice. With thoughts and desires of her own, she was no longer bound to serve V'ger.\\r\\nIn the graphic novel Star Trek: The Manga, the Borg resulted from an experiment in medical nanotechnology gone wrong. An alien species under threat of extinction by an incurable disease created a repository satellite containing test subjects infused with body parts, organs, and DNA of multiple species along with cybernetic enhancements put in place by advanced medical technology. The satellite was maintained by nanomachines, which also maintained the medical equipment on board. The medical facility is parked in orbit by a black hole, and along with the anomalous states of time around the black hole, allows long-term research to continue at an accelerated time scale rather than in real-time speed. As the medical facility deteriorates, so does the programming of the nanomachines. The nanomachines began infusing themselves into the patients, interpreting them as part of the satellite in need of repair. Among the patients is the daughter of the head medical researcher of the satellite. The satellite eventually falls apart in an encounter with an away team from the Enterprise under the command of James T. Kirk. In the final moments of the satellite's destruction and the escape of the crew members of the Enterprise with the patients, the subjects display qualities inherently resembling the Borg: injection of nanomachines in a fashion like assimilation, rapid adaptation to weaponry, and a hive mind consciousness, as all the subjects begin following the whim of the daughter. As succumbing to the disease was inevitable, and the corrupt nanomachine programming infused itself into the bodies, the final image of the page of the manga Borg origin is left with the daughter turned Borg Queen, stating, \\"Resistance is futile.\\"\\r\\nIn the novel Lost Souls (the third book in the Star Trek: Destiny trilogy), the Borg are revealed to be the survivors of the Caeliar city Mantilis. Thrown across the galaxy in the Delta Quadrant and back in time to about 4500 BC by the destruction of Erigol at the climax of Gods of Night, the first book in the trilogy, a group of human survivors from the starship Columbia NX-02 and Caeliar scientists try to survive in a harsh arctic climate. Most of the human survivors die of exposure, while several Caeliar are absorbed into their race's gestalt to give life to the others in their group mind.\\r\\nThe Caeliar offer the remaining humans a merging of human and Caeliar, to allow both groups to survive. The human survivors are resistant and as time goes on, the Caeliar called Sedin becomes the sole survivor of her group, her mental processes and her form both degrading as time goes on. When the humans return to Sedin for help, she forces them to merge with her, unwilling to allow herself to die when a union can save her life. The forced merging of the humans and the mostly decayed Caeliar results in the creation of the first Borg, the name being created due to the fragmented thought of the first drone as he was assimilated (his last thought was that he would not become some cyborg, with his individuality ceasing before he could finish thinking the final word). The gestalt group mind is perverted to become the collective, driven by Sedin's desperate hunger and need to add the strength, technology, and life-force of others to her own. Ironically, while the Caeliar wereÿalbeit accidentallyÿinvolved in the creation of the Borg, they also provide the means to end it; in the 24th century, the Caeliar absorb the entire Borg collective back into themselves, ending the cyborgs' centuries-long reign of terror.\\r\\nThough Borg costumes are all unique, they share several common characteristics. Borg commonly have one eye (most often the left eye) replaced with a sophisticated ocular implant which allows them to see beyond the human visual spectrum, though it may not always be added to them. This implant usually projects a red laser beam, particularly in later appearances. They also usually have one arm replaced with a prosthetic one, bearing one of a variety of multipurpose tools in place of a humanoid hand. Since different drones have slightly different roles, the arm may be specialized for medical purposes, or weaponized for tactical usage. Another defining feature is flat white skin, giving them an almost zombie-like appearance. This skin was originally dry and human-looking, but it later had a more \\"slick\\" look to it, with veins showing.\\r\\nDue to their cybernetic enhancements, all Borg are far stronger than humans to varying degrees (depending on the species from which the drone came). Some Borg drones are just able to easily overpower most humans and similar species, while others are strong enough to pick up or lift such species off the ground or shove or toss them across a room. However they rarely, if ever, run to their destination and most species can outpace them. Borg drones are resistant to phaser fire, being completely immune to the stun setting. In addition, all Borg drones possess personal shielding which collectively adapts to phaser fire. In various episodes, phasers tend to become ineffective after a dozen shots at most, depending on the settings and time between shots. Phaser frequencies can be altered to penetrate the shield, but the Borg adapt more quickly with each change in modulation. Due to this, crews have been known to employ a variety of other countermeasures such as holodeck-generated bullets and mle weapons, as demonstrated in Star Trek: First Contact. The Borg hive mind can lead to certain downsides: Borg drones have a weakness in that they usually ignore anything which does not present itself as a direct threat (unless specifically directed to attack), allowing armed but passive Starfleet crew to walk among them relatively unscathed until threatening behavior was observed.\\r\\nThe most important cybernetic component of any Borg is their \\"cortical node\\", which controls every other implanted \\"fixed location\\" cybernetic device within a Borg's body, and is most often implanted in the forehead above the usually retained organic right eye. If the cortical node fails, the afflicted individual Borg eventually dies, as it cannot be replicated or repaired. Successful replacement of the node can be carried out on a Borg vessel if the failure is detected promptly before the afflicted Borg's impending death.\\r\\nThe Borg are a spacefaring race, and their primary interstellar transport is known as a \\"Borg Cube\\" due to its shape. A cube was first seen in the Next Generation episode \\"Q Who?\\" upon the Borg's first contact with the Federation Starfleet in 2365. Common capabilities of cubes include high warp (transwarp) capabilities, self-regeneration and multiple-redundant systems, adaptability to assault, and various beam (tractor beams and cutting beams) and missile weapons. Different types and size of Cube have been observed, as well as Borg Spheres, which are launched from a Cube in similar fashion to an escape pod, as seen in First Contact.\\r\\nAs with most other spacefaring races, the Borg also have transporter capability, and their ability to survive in the vacuum of space means they have no need for environment or hazmat suits.\\r\\nAssimilation is the process by which the Borg integrate beings, cultures, and technology into their collective. \\"You will be assimilated\\" is one of the few on-screen phrases employed by the Borg when communicating with other species. The Borg are portrayed as having found and assimilated thousands of species and billions to trillions of individual life-forms throughout the galaxy. The Borg designate each species with a number assigned to them upon first contact; humanity for example being 'Species 5618'.\\r\\nWhen first introduced, the Borg are said to be more interested in assimilating technology than people, roaming the universe as single-minded marauders that have assimilated starships, planets, and entire societies to collect new technology. They are discriminating in this area, finding certain races, for example the Kazon, to be technologically inferior and not worthy of assimilation. A Borg infant found aboard the first cube introduced (TNG: \\"Q Who?\\") shows that the Borg will even assimilate the children of a conquered race. The Borg then place the assimilated children into maturation chambers, to quickly and fully grow them into mature drones that can be of use.\\r\\nIn their second appearance, \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", they capture and assimilate Captain Jean-Luc Picard into the collective by surgically altering him, creating Locutus of Borg, meaning \\"he who has spoken\\" or \\"he who speaks\\", in Latin, fitting as he speaks to Federation humans for them. After this, life-form assimilation becomes much more prominent in their overall behavior, as they learn about the nuances in tactics, as well as what they consider diplomacy with the human race.\\r\\nThe method of assimilating individual life-forms into the collective has been represented differently over time. The only constant is that the infant, and fetal humanoids have been grown in an accelerated state and surgically receive implants connected directly into the brain (cannot be removed without death), as well as ocular devices, tool-enhanced limbs, armor, and other prosthetics. In Star Trek: First Contact, the method of adult assimilation is depicted with the more efficient injection of nanoprobes into the individual's bloodstream through a pair of tubules that spring forth from the drone's hand (while in \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" and Star Trek: Borg, at least some Borg were shown with a syringe like prosthetic that also acted as a data port that allowed them to interface directly with technology and share data between each other). Assimilation by tubules is depicted on-screen as being a usually fast-acting process, with the victim's skin pigmentation turning gray and mottled with visible dark tracks forming within moments of contact, though it seems that the longer the victim is being injected, the quicker they can be fully transformed. The individual is then taken away for complete assimilation by drones. The tubules can also allow for direct interfacing with technology, while they are also shown to be able to reconfigure and enhance such technology into Borg technology. Sometimes assimilated Borg have been noted to be neither male nor female.[12] One theory could be that their reproductive systems have been removed upon assimilation, yet drones such as Captain Picard and Seven of Nine are easily identified as male and female. The other reason may be that the species from whence they came was gender-less. Drones who have escaped the collective have also been shown to have a gender. The individual has all traces of individuality removed and implants are attached to the new drone so it can become an integrated part of the collective. This method of assimilation is also shown to be much more surgical in nature.[1] In Star Trek: First Contact a captured crew member is shown to have a forearm and an eye physically removed and replaced with cybernetic implants.\\r\\nBecause assimilation depends on nanoprobes, species with extremely advanced immune systems are able to resist assimilation. Thus far, Species 8472 is the only race shown to be capable of completely rejecting assimilation attempts, but other species, such as the Hirogen, have also proved more than a match, both physically and technologically against the Borg.[13] Phlox was able to partially resist the assimilation process in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\".\\r\\nNanoprobes are microscopic machines that inhabit a Borg's body, bloodstream, and many cybernetic implants. The probes perform the function of maintaining the Borg cybernetic systems, as well as repairing damage to the organic parts of a Borg. They generate new technology inside a Borg when needed, as well as protecting them from many forms of disease. Borg nanoprobes, each about the size of a human red blood cell, travel through the victim's bloodstream and latch on to individual cells. The nanoprobes rewrite the cellular DNA, altering the victim's biochemistry, and eventually form larger, more complicated structures and networks within the body such as electrical pathways, processing and data-storage nodes, and ultimately prosthetic devices that spring forth from the skin, similar to cancers or tumors, which can lead to severe deformation in the skin. In \\"Mortal Coil\\", Seven of Nine states that the Borg assimilated the nanoprobe technology from \\"Species 149\\". In addition, the nanoprobes work to maintain and repair their host's mechanical and biological components on a microscopic level, allowing both sets of components regenerative capabilities.\\r\\nThough used by the Borg to exert control over another being, reprogrammed nanoprobes were used by the crew of the starship Voyager in many instances as medical aids. In one instance, the probes were used to revive crewman Neelix 18 hours, 49 minutes, and 13 seconds after death by repairing his body, and are used to treat various visitors' ailments. The ability to perform such a feat was thanks to a species that the Borg had previously assimilated.\\r\\nThe capability of nanoprobes to absorb improved technologies they find into the Borg collective is shown in the Voyager episode \\"Drone\\", where Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter which uses technology from the 29th century of the history line of the Federation, creating an individual 29th-century drone existing outside the collective, with capabilities far surpassing that of late 24th-century drones. The attempt by the Borg to assimilate this drone is unsuccessful, so its enhanced capabilities are not disseminated throughout the collective.\\r\\nThe Borg do not try to immediately assimilate any being with which it comes to contact; in fact, Borg drones tend to completely ignore beings that are identified as too weak to be a threat and too inferior to be worth assimilating. Captain Picard and his team walk safely past a group of Borg drones in a scene from the film Star Trek: First Contact because they are unarmed, while the drones fulfill a programmed mission. In the Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Mortal Coil\\", Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were \\"unworthy\\" of assimilation and would only detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.\\r\\nThe Borg use maturation chambers as the means of assimilating children that have been captured.\\r\\nThe child is kept in the maturation chamber for a period of 17 cycles.[14] Information conflicts as to how long 17 cycles is. Based on information from Star Trek: Voyager (Mortal Coil) and Star Trek: Voyager (Drone), the time equates to about six months, but in \\"Collective\\", Seven of Nine mentions that she was in her maturation chamber for five years.\\r\\nDuring this time spent in the maturation chamber, nanoprobes are introduced into the child's body along with cybernetic implants which are either surgically implanted or constructed by the nanoprobes. The child's physical age is also accelerated. When the children emerge from the maturation chambers, they have physically grown into adult drones, being no different from a drone that was already an adult when assimilated.\\r\\nThe appearance of maturation chambers has changed over time, originally seen in Star Trek: The Next Generation (\\"Q Who\\") and later in Star Trek: Voyager (Drone) and (Collective).\\r\\nThe Unicomplex is a location in the fictional Star Trek universe that is considered the central base for the Borg pseudo-race. It is located in an unknown area of the Delta Quadrant and is the center of all processing activity for the Borg collective, as well as the home of the Borg Queen. The Unicomplex resembles a patchwork-like collection of thousands of cubes, connected by assorted conduits and transportation hubs. Borg cubes frequently cross into and out of the Unicomplex on their way to other parts of the galaxy, using transwarp conduits. The Unicomplex primarily appears in the episodes leading towards the conclusion of Star Trek: Voyager. The Unicomplex was destroyed in 2378 after the Borg Queen assimilated a neurolytic pathogen from the future by Admiral Kathryn Janeway, who had traveled back in time, as seen in the Star Trek: Voyager series finale, \\"Endgame\\".\\r\\nAlso referred to as the \\"hive mind\\" or \\"collective consciousness\\", the Borg Collective is a civilization with a group mind. Each Borg individual, or drone, is linked to the collective by a sophisticated subspace network that ensures each member is given constant supervision and guidance. The collective is broadcast over a subspace domain similar to that used by the transporter. Being part of the collective offers significant biomedical advantages to the individual drones. The mental energy of the group consciousness can help an injured or damaged drone heal or regenerate damaged body parts or technology. The collective consciousness not only gives them the ability to \\"share the same thoughts\\", but also to adapt with great speed to defensive tactics used against them.[15]\\r\\nBefore the movie Star Trek: First Contact, the Borg exhibited no hierarchical command structure, instead using a structure with no control center and distributed processing. First Contact introduced the Borg Queen, who is not named as such in the film, but is referred to by that name during the credits. The Queen is played by Alice Krige in this film and in the finale of Star Trek: Voyager, \\"Endgame\\". The character also appeared in Voyager's two-part episodes \\"Dark Frontier\\" and \\"Unimatrix Zero\\", but was portrayed by Susanna Thompson (due to Krige's unavailability during the filming of those episodes). Whether or not all of these appearances represent exactly the same Queen is never confirmed.\\r\\nThe Borg Queen is the focal point within the Borg collective consciousness and a unique drone within the collective, who originates from Species 125, who brings \\"order to chaos\\", referring to herself as \\"we\\" and \\"I\\" interchangeably. In First Contact, the Queen's dialogue suggests she is an expression of the Borg Collective's overall intelligence, not a controller but the avatar of the entire Collective as an individual. This sentiment is contradicted by Star Trek: Voyager, where she is seen explicitly directing, commanding, and in one instance even overriding the Collective. She also identified herself as having originally been a member of Species 125. The introduction of the Queen radically changed the canon understanding of the Borg function with the authors of The Computers of Star Trek noting \\"It was a lot easier for viewers to focus on a villain rather than a hive-mind that made decisions based on the input of all its members.\\"[16] First Contact writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore have defended the introduction of the Queen as a dramatic necessity, noting on the film's DVD audio commentary that they had initially written the film with drones, but finding that it was essential for the main characters to have someone to interact with, beyond mindless drones.\\r\\nIn First Contact, the Borg Queen is seen as apparently present during Picard's former assimilation at the start as flashbacks in Picard's mind, and was believed destroyed along with that Borg cube years earlier. Here, she instead directs her attentions to Data. After he is captured by her drones, she tries to tempt him to join her by playing on his desire to be more human. She claims that she desires a semi-independent non-Borg being as an intellectual companion. This Queen is partially destroyed when her organic components are liquefied as a result of Data rupturing one of the Enterprise's warp core plasma coolant conduits. Picard finishes her off by breaking her spinal column with his own hands. The Queen is also destroyed in the Voyager episode \\"Endgame\\".\\r\\nIn the Star Trek: The Experience attraction The Borg Invasion 4-D, the Borg Queen reappears after Voyager returns to the Alpha Quadrant, but as Admiral Janeway attempts to kill her, she activates a transporter, allowing her to survive.\\r\\nIn the post-Star Trek Nemesis novels, the Borg Queen is not a single, irreplaceable entity, but the product of a program called \\"the Royal Protocol\\" that shares its name with a Starfleet document outlining requirements when dealing with foreign royalty. This program is used to create a Borg Queen from any female Borg (though Borg drones supposedly have no gender), commanding the technology within her to alter and adapt to the protocol's specifications. In the relaunch novels, one of the leaders of Starfleet Intelligence gets her hands on the Royal Protocol, and with the use of an emergency medical hologram, turns herself into a new kind of Borg Queen who cares about and loves her drones.\\r\\nAlternatively, in the game Star Trek: Legacy, bonus content unlockable throughout the course of the game offers further information on the role of the queen. It is suggested that the females of a particular species have a natural ability to filter and control the immense 'traffic' of thought present in the collective consciousness of the Borg. These females, in a sense, serve as regulators or signal boosters even assisting in maintaining the complete consciousness over the thousands of lightyears of Borg space. This also presents the possibility of multiple queens, which would be a suitable explanation for why, on more than one occasion, a Starfleet officer has 'killed the queen'. In the illustration accompanying the explanation, all the females distinctly resemble the queen portrayed on screen, suggesting that this is Species 125, mentioned by the Borg Queen as her original species in \\"Dark Frontier\\".\\r\\nIn the novel Before Dishonor by Peter David, Admiral Janeway is assimilated while exploring a supposedly \\"dead\\" Borg supercube and is later transformed into the Borg Queen. She is later stopped by Seven of Nine, who introduced a virus into the Borg ship. This leads to the events of the Destiny trilogy.\\r\\nIn the Mirror Universe novella The Worst of Both Worlds by Greg Cox, the Borg are led by a king.\\r\\nThe Borg first appear in the Star Trek: The Next Generation second-season episode \\"Q Who?\\", when the omnipotent life-form Q hurls the Enterprise-D across the galaxy to challenge Jean-Luc Picard's assertion that his crew is ready to face the unexplored galaxy's unknown dangers and mysteries. The Enterprise crew is quickly overwhelmed by the relentless Borg, and Picard eventually begs for and receives Q's help in returning the ship to its previous coordinates in the Alpha Quadrant. At the episode's conclusion, Picard suggests to Guinan that Q did \\"the right thing for the wrong reason\\" by showing the dangers they will eventually face. It is suggested that the Borg may have been responsible for the destruction of Federation and Romulan colonies in the final episode of season one, \\"The Neutral Zone\\".[17]\\r\\nThe Borg next appear in The Next Generation's third-season finale and fourth-season premiere, \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\". In the third-season cliffhanger, Picard is abducted and subsequently assimilated by the Borg and transformed into Locutus, the Latin term for \\"he who has spoken\\" or \\"he who speaks\\". \\"Locutus\\" is the Borg method of describing the former Picard as the representative of the Borg in all future contacts related to humanity. Picard's knowledge of Starfleet is gained by the collective, and the single cube easily wipes out all resistance in its path, notably the entire Starfleet armada at Wolf 359, which consisted of 40 starships, some of which were sent from the Klingon Empire. The Enterprise crew manages to capture Locutus and gain information through him which allows them to destroy the cube. Picard is later \\"deassimilated\\", a process quite different from what happened to Seven of Nine in Star Trek: Voyager (Seven of Nine had to be completely \\"re-schooled\\" on humanity, while Picard merely needed to be reminded of humanity. This could be because unlike Seven of Nine, Picard was assimilated for only a short while, while Seven of Nine was assimilated as a child).\\r\\nIn the fifth-season episode \\"I, Borg\\", the Enterprise crew rescues a solitary adolescent Borg who is given the name \\"Hugh\\" by Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge. The crew faces the moral decision of whether or not to use Hugh (who begins to develop a sense of independence as a result of a severed link to the collective consciousness of the Borg) as an apocalyptic means of delivering a devastating computer virus, in the form of a topological paradox problem, that would theoretically destroy the Borg, or to humanely allow him to return to the Borg with his individuality intact.[18] They decide to return him without the virus. This is followed up in the sixth-season cliffhanger \\"Descent\\", which depicts a group of rogue Borg who had \\"assimilated\\" individuality through Hugh. These rogue Borg fell under the control of the psychopathic android Lore, the \\"older brother\\" of Data.\\r\\nIn cult leader-like fashion, Lore had manipulated them into following him by appealing to their restored emotions and exploiting their new-found senses of individuality and fear, hoping to turn them on the Federation. Lore also corrupts Data through the use of the emotion chip he had stolen from Noonien Soong (Data and Lore's creator). In the end, Data's ethical subroutines are restored (having been suppressed by Lore through use of the emotion chip) and he manages to deactivate Lore after a battle in which a renegade Borg faction led by Hugh attacks the main complex. Data reclaims the emotion chip, Lore is mentioned as needing to be dismantled (for safety) and the surviving Borg fall under the leadership of Hugh. The fate of these deassimilated Borg is not revealed, though non-canon material suggests that they remained on the planet and established a permanent colony.\\r\\nThe Borg return as the antagonists in one of the Next Generation films, Star Trek: First Contact. After again failing to assimilate Earth by a direct assault in the year 2373, the Borg travel back in time to the year 2063 to try to stop Zefram Cochrane's first contact with the Vulcans, which would have erased the Federation from history. The Enterprise-E crew follows the Borg back in time, and restores the original timeline. First Contact introduces the Borg Queen, a recurring character on Star Trek: Voyager.\\r\\nParts of this destroyed Borg sphere, along with at least two drones, are shown to have crash landed in the Arctic in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\".\\r\\nThe only appearance the Borg made on this series was in the premiere episode Emissary. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) was an officer on the USS Saratoga, one of the ships in the Starfleet armada dispatched to Wolf 359. The Saratoga was hailed by the Borg cube with Locutus speaking as their representative. The Borg opened fire on the Saratoga, leading to the deaths of most of the ship's personnel, including Sisko's wife Jennifer. This created great resentment in Sisko when dealing with Picard; for Sisko, Picard was the living embodiment of the suffering the Borg inflicted at Wolf 359, making their meeting in \\"Emissary\\" tense when Picard gave Sisko his orders for taking over the station. Sisko found it hard to separate Jean-Luc Picard from the Borg drone who was responsible for his wife's death.\\r\\nDespite their absence for the vast majority of the series beyond the pilot, references to the Borg, as well as the Wolf 359 massacre, are made occasionally throughout the series. In fact, the USS Defiant, a primary starship setting from the third season onwards, is explicitly stated to have been designed as a countermeasure against the Borg though it is later used against the Dominion.[19] In addition, the battle from Star Trek: First Contact is used as a plot point in Season 5 as Starfleet is spread thin to deal with a Dominion incursion.\\r\\nIn First Contact, the Defiant is heavily damaged during a battle with the Borg; the ship is later declared 'adrift, but salvageable', which allowed Deep Space Nine's producers to retain their signature starship.\\r\\nThe Borg make frequent appearances in Star Trek: Voyager, which takes place in the Delta Quadrant, the region of the galaxy from which the Borg are believed to have originated. The Borg are first discovered by Voyager in the third-season episode \\"Blood Fever\\". Chakotay discovers the body of what the local humanoids refer to as \\"the Invaders\\"; which turns out to be the Borg. In \\"Scorpion\\", the Borg are engaged in a war of attrition against Species 8472, whose biological defences, developed as a feature of their evolution in fluidic space, are a match for the Borg's nanoprobes. In one of the few instances of the Borg negotiating, in exchange for safe passage through Borg space, the Voyager crew devises a way to destroy the otherwise invulnerable Species 8472. A Borg drone, Seven of Nine, is dispatched to Voyager to facilitate this arrangement as Captain Janeway refuses to allow the Borg to use neural implants for communication with the Voyager crew.\\r\\nAfter successfully driving Species 8472 back into their fluidic space, Seven of Nine attempts to assimilate Voyager but is severed from the hive mind and stripped of most of her Borg implants, becoming a member of Voyager's crew. Seven of Nine's rediscovery of her individuality becomes a recurring theme throughout the series. Flashbacks and allusions in several episodes, such as \\"The Raven\\", establish that before her assimilation, Seven of Nine was Annika Hansen, the child of scientists who studied the Borg in the Delta Quadrant independent of the Federation. Unfortunately her parents were assimilated into the collective with her, but her father makes a temporary appearance in the final episode of Voyager.\\r\\nIn \\"Drone\\", an advanced Borg drone is created when Seven of Nine's nanoprobes are fused with the Doctor's mobile emitter in a transporter accident. The drone, who adopts the moniker \\"One\\", involuntarily sends a signal to the collective, bringing a sphere to Voyager. One destroys the Borg ship and lets himself die to protect Voyager from further Borg pursuits.\\r\\nIn \\"Infinite Regress\\" it was revealed that all Borg starships have a device called a vinculum which connects all the minds of the drones, eliminates individual thoughts, and disseminates information to the Borg Collective.\\r\\nIn \\"Dark Frontier\\", Captain Kathryn Janeway decides to attack the Borg in the hopes of stealing a transwarp coil to aid Voyager's journey home. The Borg Queen learns of the plot and offers Seven of Nine a deal to spare Voyager in exchange for her rejoining the collective. Voyager recovers the transwarp coil and uses it, with the Delta Flyer, to save Seven from the Queen. Voyager uses the transwarp coil to travel 20,000 light-years before it burns out.\\r\\nIn \\"Collective\\", the crew of Voyager stumble upon a severely damaged cube that is holding Tom Paris, Neelix, Harry and Chakotay hostage. The crew later finds out that the ship is run by five Borg children who left their maturation chambers early. There are no living adult drones on board the ship due to a pathogen that somehow infected the entire vessel. The children sent a message to the collective that they were attacked. The collective replied and told them they were irrelevant. Seven of Nine is sent to assist in repairs and negotiate a trade for the prisoners. Voyager is soon attacked by the cube when the Borg children attempt to rip the main deflector off of the hull so they can rejoin the collective. When the cube's leader dies, Seven takes the children onto Voyager, has their non-essential Borg components removed. Most of the deassimilated children were returned to their home planets; one chose to remain with Voyager, and was eventually given the provisional rank of Cadet.\\r\\nIn \\"Q2\\", Q's son places Voyager in danger and brings Borg onto the ship. Q intercedes, saves Voyager and angrily warns his son about provoking the Borg.\\r\\nIn the Voyager finale, \\"Endgame\\", an elderly Admiral Janeway from the future travels back in time, to aid in Voyager's return to the Alpha Quadrant through the use of a Borg transwarp hub. This hub is one of six such structures scattered across the galaxy, which allow Borg ships to traverse galactic distances in mere minutes. The future Janeway uses the hub and travels to Unicomplex 1, the primary control center of the Borg and the residence of the Queen. She deliberately infects herself with a neurolytic pathogen, and when she was assimilated, the pathogen rapidly spreads and infects a majority of the collective and kills the Queen. With the Queen dead, the hive mind is fractured and Borg technology ceases to adapt to weapons fire. Without the adaptations against transphasic torpedoes, Voyager fires the torpedoes at the transwarp conduits holding the transwarp network together and they are easily destroyed. On the way, a Borg sphere pursues and captures Voyager, but upon arrival at Earth, it is destroyed from the inside by Voyager's transphasic torpedo.\\r\\nThe Borg make their last canon appearance in the Star Trek: Enterprise episode \\"Regeneration\\", the remnants of the destroyed sphere from Star Trek: First Contact are discovered in the Arctic along with two frozen drones. Once unearthed, the Borg quickly revive and assimilate the human scientists who found them before stealing an unarmed research ship, modifying it to match Starfleet technology in a matter of hours. The drones manage to send a transmission toward the Delta Quadrant before they are destroyed. According to dialogue, their transmission would reach its destination in 200 years, essentially establishing a closed time loop with the events of \\"Q Who\\", explaining why the cube in the latter episode was already en route to Earth[citation needed]. Although the Borg never identify themselves as such in dialogue, the episode's events prompt characters to allude to Zefram Cochrane's claims that \\"strange cybernetic creatures from the future\\" tried to interfere with First Contact.\\r\\nWriters Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens developed an unproduced idea for an episode which would have featured Alice Krige as a Starfleet medical technician who encounters the Borg and is assimilated ÿ thereby becoming the Borg Queen.[20]\\r\\nIn the non-canonical Star Trek: The Manga story 'Side Effects' written by Chris Dows, the crew of the Enterprise under James T. Kirk discovers an alien station operating near a black hole. The commander of the station appears to be abducting races in a desperate attempt to cure a strange plague among his people. Using his own daughter as a guinea pig, he is able to create a cure for the plague, though the end result is always assimilation into the consciousness of his daughter, the future Borg Queen, for those cured.\\r\\nIn the Star Trek novel Probe, which takes place following the events of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, the Borg are mentioned obliquely in communication with the whale-probe as spacefaring \\"mites\\" (the whale-probe's term for humanoid races) who traveled in cubical and spherical spacefaring vessels; the Borg apparently attacked the whale-probe and damaged its memory in some fashion before the events of the film.\\r\\nIn the Star Trek Game Star Trek: Legacy, the Borg are featured midway through the TOS era as \\"Assimilated Klingon ships\\". In the final mission, once the player has completed the primary objective, a confrontation with T'urell ensues; she departs, and the player must destroy a Borg Sphere.\\r\\nThe Peter David novel Vendetta reveals that the planet killer weapon from the Original Series episode \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" is a prototype for a weapon against the Borg, with a woman whose race were destroyed by the Borg trying to use the weapon against them despite the damage she will cause on her journey due to its need to consume planets. David revisited this concept in a 2007 sequel novel, Before Dishonor, which features the Enterprise-E working with Spock and Seven of Nine to reactivate the original planet killer to stop the Borg.\\r\\nIn William Shatner's novel The Return, Spock is nearly assimilated by the Borg, but is saved because he mind-melded with V'ger, an earlier form of the Borg, causing the Borg to register an \\"imprint\\" of the Collective already in Spock's mind and spare him as they assume that he is already a Borg. Using the information he subconsciously acquired in the meld, Spock is able to lead a crew of Enterprise officers- consisting of the Enterprise-D senior staff, himself, Admiral McCoy, and the resurrected Kirk- in a Defiant-class ship to destroy the Borg central node, severing all branches of the Collective from each other and limiting their future threat.\\r\\nIn David Mack's novel trilogy Star Trek: Destiny, set over a year after Star Trek: Nemesis, the Borg stage a massive invasion of local space using the totality of their forces. Due to Kathryn Janeway crippling their infrastructure in \\"Endgame\\", the Borg fear for their survival and thus attempt to exterminate the Federation and its neighbors. They wipe out the populations of numerous Federation worlds before being dismantled by the Caeliar, the advanced species that spawned them. The crews of the Enterprise-E, the Titan, and the Aventine had made contact with the Caeliar, learned of their role in the creation of the Borg from Erika Hernandez, and convinced them to end the threat of the Borg once and for all.\\r\\nIn the Doctor Who/Star Trek crossover comic, Assimilation2, the Borg join forces with the Cybermen, but the Enterprise-D crew are later forced to work with the Eleventh Doctor and the Borg when the Cybermen subvert the Collective, resulting in them restoring the Borg to full strength and erasing the Borg/Cyberman alliance from existence.[21]\\r\\nIn the video game Star Trek: Armada, the Borg invades a Dominion cloning facility to create a clone of Jean-Luc Picard to assimilate him into Locutus.\\r\\nThe Borg appear as antagonists to the player in the following Star Trek videogame titles:\\r\\nThey also appear as the main characters in one of the Star Trek arcade games, Star Trek: Borg Contact, where players must squeeze two handles without letting go.\\r\\nActivision at one point planned to release Star Trek: Borg Assimilator, in which the player would play a Borg, but later canceled the game.\\r\\nThe depiction of the Borg cube in \\"Q Who\\" garnered the episode an Emmy Award nomination.[22]","input":"When do the borg first appear in voyager?"},{"output":"at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants","context":"The California Gold Rush (1848ÿ1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.[1] The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[2] The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation. By the time it ended, California had gone from a thinly populated ex-Mexican territory to the home state of the first nominee for the Republican Party.\\r\\nThe effects of the Gold Rush were substantial. Whole indigenous societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by the gold-seekers, called \\"forty-niners\\" (referring to 1849). The first to hear confirmed information of the gold rush were the people in Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), and Latin America, and they were the first to start flocking to the state in late 1848. Of the 300,000 people who came to America during the Gold Rush, approximately half arrived by sea and half came overland on the California Trail and the Gila River trail; forty-niners often faced substantial hardships on the trip. While most of the newly arrived were Americans, the Gold Rush attracted tens of thousands from Latin America, Europe, Australia, and China. Agriculture and ranching expanded throughout the state to meet the needs of the settlers. San Francisco grew from a small settlement of about 200 residents in 1846 to a boomtown of about 36,000 by 1852. Roads, churches, schools and other towns were built throughout California. In 1849 a state constitution was written. The new constitution was adopted by referendum vote, and the future state's interim first governor and legislature were chosen. In September, 1850, California became a state.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no law regarding property rights in the goldfields and a system of \\"staking claims\\" was developed. Prospectors retrieved the gold from streams and riverbeds using simple techniques, such as panning. Although the mining caused environmental harm, more sophisticated methods of gold recovery were developed and later adopted around the world. New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service. By 1869 railroads were built across the country from California to the eastern United States. At its peak, technological advances reached a point where significant financing was required, increasing the proportion of gold companies to individual miners. Gold worth tens of billions of today's dollars was recovered, which led to great wealth for a few. However, many returned home with little more than they had started with.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MexicanÿAmerican War ended on February 3, 1848, although California was firmly in American hands before that. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided for, among other things, the formal transfer of Upper California to the United States. The California Gold Rush began at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma.[3] On January 24, 1848, James W. Marshall, a foreman working for Sacramento pioneer John Sutter, found shiny metal in the tailrace of a lumber mill Marshall was building for Sutter on the American River.[4] Marshall brought what he found to John Sutter, and the two privately tested the metal. After the tests showed that it was gold, Sutter expressed dismay: he wanted to keep the news quiet because he feared what would happen to his plans for an agricultural empire if there were a mass search for gold.[5]\\r\\nHowever, rumors soon started to spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan. The most famous quote of the California Gold Rush was by Brannan; after he had hurriedly set up a store to sell gold prospecting supplies,[6] Brannan strode through the streets of San Francisco, holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting \\"Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!\\"[7]\\r\\nOn August 19, 1848, the New York Herald was the first major newspaper on the East Coast to report the discovery of gold. On December 5, 1848, President James Polk confirmed the discovery of gold in an address to Congress.[8] Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the \\"forty-niners,\\" invaded the Gold Country of California or \\"Mother Lode\\". As Sutter had feared, he was ruined; his workers left in search of gold, and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle.[9]\\r\\nSan Francisco had been a tiny settlement before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses,[10] but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco exploded from perhaps about 1,000[11] in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850.[12] Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.[13]\\r\\nIn what has been referred to as the \\"first world-class gold rush,\\"[14] there was no easy way to get to California; forty-niners faced hardship and often death on the way. At first, most Argonauts, as they were also known, traveled by sea. From the East Coast, a sailing voyage around the tip of South America would take five to eight months,[15] and cover some 18,000 nautical miles (33,000 kilometres). An alternative was to sail to the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama, take canoes and mules for a week through the jungle, and then on the Pacific side, wait for a ship sailing for San Francisco.[16] There was also a route across Mexico starting at Veracruz. Many gold-seekers took the overland route across the continental United States, particularly along the California Trail.[17] Each of these routes had its own deadly hazards, from shipwreck to typhoid fever and cholera.[18]\\r\\nTo meet the demands of the arrivals, ships bearing goods from around the world came to San Francisco as well. Ships' captains found that their crews deserted to go to the goldfields. The wharves and docks of San Francisco became a forest of masts, as hundreds of ships were abandoned. Enterprising San Franciscans turned the abandoned ships into warehouses, stores, taverns, hotels, and one into a jail.[19] Many of these ships were later destroyed and used for landfill to create more buildable land in the boomtown.[19]\\r\\nWithin a few years, there was an important but lesser-known surge of prospectors into far Northern California, specifically into present-day Siskiyou, Shasta and Trinity Counties.[20] Discovery of gold nuggets at the site of present-day Yreka in 1851 brought thousands of gold-seekers up the Siskiyou Trail[21] and throughout California's northern counties.[22]\\r\\nSettlements of the Gold Rush era, such as Portuguese Flat on the Sacramento River, sprang into existence and then faded. The Gold Rush town of Weaverville on the Trinity River today retains the oldest continuously used Taoist temple in California, a legacy of Chinese miners who came. While there are not many Gold Rush era ghost towns still in existence, the remains of the once-bustling town of Shasta have been preserved in a California State Historic Park in Northern California.[23]\\r\\nGold was also discovered in Southern California but on a much smaller scale. The first discovery of gold, at Rancho San Francisco in the mountains north of present-day Los Angeles, had been in 1842, six years before Marshall's discovery, while California was still part of Mexico.[24] However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.[24]\\r\\nBy 1850, most of the easily accessible gold had been collected, and attention turned to extracting gold from more difficult locations. Faced with gold increasingly difficult to retrieve, Americans began to drive out foreigners to get at the most accessible gold that remained. The new California State Legislature passed a foreign miners tax of twenty dollars per month ($580 per month as of 2017), and American prospectors began organized attacks on foreign miners, particularly Latin Americans and Chinese.[25]\\r\\nIn addition, the huge numbers of newcomers were driving Native Americans out of their traditional hunting, fishing and food-gathering areas. To protect their homes and livelihood, some Native Americans responded by attacking the miners. This provoked counter-attacks on native villages. The Native Americans, out-gunned, were often slaughtered.[26] Those who escaped massacres were many times unable to survive without access to their food-gathering areas, and they starved to death. Novelist and poet Joaquin Miller vividly captured one such attack in his semi-autobiographical work, Life Amongst the Modocs.[27]\\r\\nThe first gold found in California was made on March 9, 1842. Francisco Lopez, a native California, was searching for stray horses. He stopped on the bank of a small creek in what later was known as Placerita Canyon, about 3 miles (4.8?km) east of the present-day Newhall, California, and about 35 miles (56?km) northwest of Los Angeles. While the horses grazed, Lopez dug up some wild onions and found a small gold nugget in the roots among the onion bulbs. He looked further and found more gold.[28]\\r\\nLopez took the gold to authorities who confirmed its worth. Lopez and others began to search for other steambeds with gold deposits in the area. They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In 1843 he found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846, when the Californios began to agitate for independence from Mexico, and the Bear Flag Revolt caused many Mexicans to leave California.[28]\\r\\nThe first people to rush to the goldfields, beginning in the spring of 1848, were the residents of California themselvesprimarily agriculturally oriented Americans and Europeans living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians).[29] These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.[30]\\r\\nWord of the Gold Rush spread slowly at first. The earliest gold-seekers were people who lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail.[31] Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and from as far away as Chile,[32] both by ship and overland.[33] By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.[33]\\r\\nOnly a small number (probably fewer than 500) traveled overland from the United States that year.[33] Some of these \\"forty-eighters\\",[34] as the earliest gold-seekers were sometimes called, were able to collect large amounts of easily accessible goldin some cases, thousands of dollars worth each day.[35][36] Even ordinary prospectors averaged daily gold finds worth 10 to 15 times the daily wage of a laborer on the East Coast. A person could work for six months in the goldfields and find the equivalent of six years' wages back home.[37] Some hoped to get rich quick and return home, and others wished to start businesses in California.\\r\\nBy the beginning of 1849, word of the Gold Rush had spread around the world, and an overwhelming number of gold-seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent. The largest group of forty-niners in 1849 were Americans, arriving by the tens of thousands overland across the continent and along various sailing routes[38] (the name \\"forty-niner\\" was derived from the year 1849). Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania, poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports, and then travelling in a wagon train along the California Trail. Many others came by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the steamships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Australians[39] and New Zealanders picked up the news from ships carrying Hawaiian newspapers, and thousands, infected with \\"gold fever\\", boarded ships for California.[40]\\r\\nForty-niners came from Latin America, particularly from the Mexican mining districts near Sonora and Chile.[40][41] Gold-seekers and merchants from Asia, primarily from China,[42] began arriving in 1849, at first in modest numbers to Gum San (\\"Gold Mountain\\"), the name given to California in Chinese.[43] The first immigrants from Europe, reeling from the effects of the Revolutions of 1848 and with a longer distance to travel, began arriving in late 1849, mostly from France,[44] with some Germans, Italians, and Britons.[38]\\r\\nIt is estimated that approximately 90,000 people arrived in California in 1849about half by land and half by sea.[45] Of these, perhaps 50,000 to 60,000 were Americans, and the rest were from other countries.[38] By 1855, it is estimated at least 300,000 gold-seekers, merchants, and other immigrants had arrived in California from around the world.[46] The largest group continued to be Americans, but there were tens of thousands each of Mexicans, Chinese, Britons, Australians[47] French, and Latin Americans,[48] together with many smaller groups of miners, such as African Americans, Filipinos, Basques[49] and Turks.[50][51]\\r\\nPeople from small villages in the hills near Genova, Italy were among the first to settle permanently in the Sierra Nevada foothills; they brought with them traditional agricultural skills, developed to survive cold winters.[52] A modest number of miners of African ancestry (probably less than 4,000)[53] had come from the Southern States,[54] the Caribbean and Brazil.[55]\\r\\nA number of immigrants were from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco.[56] Their distinctive dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, there has been no justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.[57][56]\\r\\nThere were also women in the Gold Rush. However, their numbers were small. Of the 40,000 people who arrived by ship in the San Francisco harbor in 1849, only 700 were women.[58] They held various roles including prostitutes, single entrepreneurs, married women, poor and wealthy women. They were of various ethnicities including Anglo-American, African-American,[59] Hispanic, Native, European, Chinese, and Jewish. The reasons they came varied: some came with their husbands, refusing to be left behind to fend for themselves, some came because their husbands sent for them, and others came (singles and widows) for the adventure and economic opportunities.[60] On the trail many people died from accidents, cholera, fever, and myriad other causes, and many women became widows before even setting eyes on California. While in California, women became widows quite frequently due to mining accidents, disease, or mining disputes of their husbands. Life in the goldfields offered opportunities for women to break from their traditional work.[61][62]\\r\\nThe disproportionate number of men to women in San Francisco created an environment for homosexuality and gay cultures to flourish.[63] The Barbary Coast was a district where men went to gamble and pay for sex from female impersonators and women alike.[63] Described as the \\"city of bachelors\\" [63] men often went to the Barbary Coast district to pay for prostitution and pleasure with other men.[64]\\r\\nWhen the Gold Rush began, the California goldfields were peculiarly lawless places.[65] When gold was discovered at Sutter's Mill, California was still technically part of Mexico, under American military occupation as the result of the MexicanÿAmerican War. With the signing of the treaty ending the war on February 2, 1848, California became a possession of the United States, but it was not a formal \\"territory\\" and did not become a state until September 9, 1850. California existed in the unusual condition of a region under military control. There was no civil legislature, executive or judicial body for the entire region.[66] Local residents operated under a confusing and changing mixture of Mexican rules, American principles, and personal dictates. Lax enforcement of federal laws, such as the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, encouraged the arrival of free blacks and escaped slaves.[67]\\r\\nWhile the treaty ending the MexicanÿAmerican War obliged the United States to honor Mexican land grants,[68] almost all the goldfields were outside those grants. Instead, the goldfields were primarily on \\"public land\\", meaning land formally owned by the United States government.[69] However, there were no legal rules yet in place,[65] and no practical enforcement mechanisms.[70]\\r\\nThe benefit to the forty-niners was that the gold was simply \\"free for the taking\\" at first. In the goldfields at the beginning, there was no private property, no licensing fees, and no taxes.[71][72] The miners informally adapted Mexican mining law that had existed in California.[73] For example, the rules attempted to balance the rights of early arrivers at a site with later arrivers; a \\"claim\\" could be \\"staked\\" by a prospector, but that claim was valid only as long as it was being actively worked.[65][74][75]\\r\\nMiners worked at a claim only long enough to determine its potential. If a claim was deemed as low-valueas most wereminers would abandon the site in search for a better one. In the case where a claim was abandoned or not worked upon, other miners would \\"claim-jump\\" the land. \\"Claim-jumping\\" meant that a miner began work on a previously claimed site.[74][75] Disputes were often handled personally and violently, and were sometimes addressed by groups of prospectors acting as arbitrators.[69][74][75] This often led to heightened ethnic tensions.[76] In some areas the influx of many prospectors could lead to a reduction of the existing claim size by simple pressure.[77]\\r\\nFour hundred million years ago, California lay at the bottom of a large sea; underwater volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra Nevada,[78] and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams.[79][80] The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.[81]\\r\\nBecause the gold in the California gravel beds was so richly concentrated, early forty-niners were able to retrieve loose gold flakes and nuggets with their hands, or simply \\"pan\\" for gold in rivers and streams.[82][83] However, panning cannot take place on a large scale, and industrious miners and groups of miners graduated to placer mining, using \\"cradles\\" and \\"rockers\\" or \\"long-toms\\"[84] to process larger volumes of gravel.[85] Miners would also engage in \\"coyoteing\\",[86] a method that involved digging a shaft 6 to 13 meters (20 to 43?ft) deep into placer deposits along a stream. Tunnels were then dug in all directions to reach the richest veins of pay dirt.\\r\\nIn the most complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice alongside the river, and then dig for gold in the newly exposed river bottom.[87] Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces[88] (370?t) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush (worth over US$16?billion at December 2010 prices).[89]\\r\\nIn the next stage, by 1853, hydraulic mining was used on ancient gold-bearing gravel beds on hillsides and bluffs in the goldfields.[90] In a modern style of hydraulic mining first developed in California, and later used around the world, a high-pressure hose directed a powerful stream or jet of water at gold-bearing gravel beds.[91] The loosened gravel and gold would then pass over sluices, with the gold settling to the bottom where it was collected. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11 million ounces (340?t) of gold (worth approximately US$15?billion at December 2010 prices) had been recovered by \\"hydraulicking\\".[89]\\r\\nA byproduct of these extraction methods was that large amounts of gravel, silt, heavy metals, and other pollutants went into streams and rivers.[92] As of 1999[update] many areas still bear the scars of hydraulic mining, since the resulting exposed earth and downstream gravel deposits do not support plant life.[93]\\r\\nAfter the Gold Rush had concluded, gold recovery operations continued. The final stage to recover loose gold was to prospect for gold that had slowly washed down into the flat river bottoms and sandbars of California's Central Valley and other gold-bearing areas of California (such as Scott Valley in Siskiyou County). By the late 1890s, dredging technology (also invented in California) had become economical,[94] and it is estimated that more than 20?million ounces (620?t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$28?billion at December 2010 prices).[89]\\r\\nBoth during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, gold-seekers also engaged in \\"hard-rock\\" mining, that is, extracting the gold directly from the rock that contained it (typically quartz), usually by digging and blasting to follow and remove veins of the gold-bearing quartz.[95] By 1851, quartz mining had become the major industry of Coloma.[96] Once the gold-bearing rocks were brought to surface, the rocks were crushed and the gold separated, either using separation in water, using its density difference from quartz sand, or by washing the sand over copper plates coated with mercury (with which gold forms an amalgam). Loss of mercury in the amalgamation process was a source of environmental contamination.[97] Eventually, hard-rock mining wound up becoming the single largest source of gold produced in the Gold Country.[89][98] The total production of gold in California from then till now is estimated at 118 million ounces (3700 t).[99]\\r\\nForty-niner panning for gold\\r\\nSluice for separation of gold from dirt with water\\r\\nExcavating a river bed after the water has been diverted\\r\\nCrushing quartz ore prior to washing out gold\\r\\nExcavating a gravel bed with jets, circa 1863\\r\\nRecent scholarship confirms that merchants made far more money than miners during the Gold Rush.[100][101] The wealthiest man in California during the early years of the rush was Samuel Brannan, a tireless self-promoter, shopkeeper and newspaper publisher.[102] Brannan opened the first supply stores in Sacramento, Coloma, and other spots in the goldfields. Just as the rush began he purchased all the prospecting supplies available in San Francisco and re-sold them at a substantial profit.[102]\\r\\nSome gold-seekers made a significant amount of money.[103] On average, half the gold-seekers made a modest profit, after taking all expenses into account; economic historians have suggested that white miners were more successful than black, Indian, or Chinese miners.[104] However, taxes such as the California foreign miners tax passed in 1851, targeted mainly Latino miners[105] and kept them from making as much money as whites, who didn't have any taxes imposed on them. In California Most late arrivals made little or wound up losing money.[106] Similarly, many unlucky merchants set up in settlements which disappeared, or which succumbed to one of the calamitous fires that swept the towns that sprang up. By contrast, a businessman who went on to great success was Levi Strauss, who first began selling denim overalls in San Francisco in 1853.[107]\\r\\nOther businessmen reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging,[108] or transportation.[109] Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, and laundry were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay well for a service done by a woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.[110]\\r\\nBy 1855, the economic climate had changed dramatically. Gold could be retrieved profitably from the goldfields only by medium to large groups of workers, either in partnerships or as employees. By the mid-1850s, it was the owners of these gold-mining companies who made the money. Also, the population and economy of California had become large and diverse enough that money could be made in a wide variety of conventional businesses.[111]\\r\\nOnce extracted, the gold itself took many paths. First, much of the gold was used locally to purchase food, supplies and lodging for the miners. It also went towards entertainment, which consisted of anything from a traveling theater to alcohol, gambling, and prostitutes. These transactions often took place using the recently recovered gold, carefully weighed out.[112][113] These merchants and vendors in turn used the gold to purchase supplies from ship captains or packers bringing goods to California.[114]\\r\\nThe gold then left California aboard ships or mules to go to the makers of the goods from around the world. A second path was the Argonauts themselves who, having personally acquired a sufficient amount, sent the gold home, or returned home taking with them their hard-earned \\"diggings\\". For example, one estimate is that some US$80?million worth of California gold was sent to France by French prospectors and merchants.[115]\\r\\nAs the Gold Rush progressed, local banks and gold dealers issued \\"banknotes\\" or \\"drafts\\"locally accepted paper currencyin exchange for gold,[116] and private mints created private gold coins.[117] With the building of the San Francisco Mint in 1854, gold bullion was turned into official United States gold coins for circulation.[118] The gold was also later sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the booming California economy.[119]\\r\\nThe arrival of hundreds of thousands of new people in California within a few years, compared to a population of some 15,000?Europeans and Californios beforehand,[120] had many dramatic effects.[121]\\r\\nA 2017 study attributes the record-long economic expansion of the United States in the recession-free period of 1841-1856 primarily to \\"a boom in transportation-goods investment following the discovery of gold in California.\\"[122]\\r\\nThe Gold Rush propelled California from a sleepy, little-known backwater to a center of the global imagination and the destination of hundreds of thousands of people. The new immigrants often showed remarkable inventiveness and civic-mindedness. For example, in the midst of the Gold Rush, towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.[123]\\r\\nLarge-scale agriculture (California's second \\"Gold Rush\\"[124]) began during this time.[125] Roads, schools, churches,[126] and civic organizations quickly came into existence.[123] The vast majority of the immigrants were Americans.[127] Pressure grew for better communications and political connections to the rest of the United States, leading to statehood for California on September 9, 1850, in the Compromise of 1850 as the 31st state of the United States.\\r\\nBetween 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.[128] The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855.[129] Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America,[130] ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off the coast of the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.[131][132]\\r\\nThe human and environmental costs of the Gold Rush were substantial. Native Americans, dependent on traditional hunting, gathering and agriculture, became the victims of starvation and disease, as gravel, silt and toxic chemicals from prospecting operations killed fish and destroyed habitats.[92][93] The surge in the mining population also resulted in the disappearance of game and food gathering locales as gold camps and other settlements were built amidst them. Later farming spread to supply the settlers' camps, taking more land away from the Native Americans.[133]\\r\\nIn some areas, systematic attacks against tribespeople in or near mining districts occurred. Various conflicts were fought between natives and settlers.[134]Miners often saw Native Americans as impediments to their mining activities.[135] Ed Allen, interpretive lead for Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park, reported that there were times when miners would kill up to 50 or more Natives in one day.[136] Retribution attacks on solitary miners could result in larger scale attacks against Native populations, at times tribes or villages not involved in the original act.[137] During the 1852 Bridge Gulch Massacre, a group of settlers attacked a band of Wintu Indians in response to the killing of a citizen named J. R. Anderson. After his killing, the sheriff led a group of men to track down the Indians, whom the men then attacked. Only three children survived the massacre that was against a different band of Wintu than the one that had killed Anderson.[138]\\r\\nHistorian Benjamin Madley recorded the numbers of killings of California Indians between 1846 and 1873 and estimated that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians, mostly occurring in more than 370 massacres (defined as the \\"intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise\\").[139] According to demographer Russell Thornton, between 1849 and 1890, the Indigenous population of California fell below 20,000 ÿ primarily because of the killings.[140] According to the government of California, some 4,500 Native Americans suffered violent deaths between 1849 and 1870.[141] Furthermore, California stood in opposition of ratifying the eighteen treaties signed between tribal leaders and federal agents in 1851.[142]\\r\\nThe state government, in support of miner activities funded and supported death squads, appropriating over 1 million dollars towards the funding and operation of the paramilitary organizations.[143] Peter Burnett, California's first governor declared that California was a battleground between the races and that there were only two options towards California Indians, extermination or removal. \\"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\\" For Burnett, like many of his contemporaries, the genocide was part of God's plan, and it was necessary for Burnett's constituency to move forward in California.[144] The Act for the Government and Protection of Indians, passed on April 22, 1850 by the California Legislature, allowed settlers to capture and use Native people as bonded workers, prohibited Native peoples' testimony against settlers, and allowed the adoption of Native children by settlers, often for labor purposes.[145]\\r\\nAfter the initial boom had ended, explicitly anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought to drive out foreignersnot just Native Americansfrom the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile.[56][146] The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.[147]\\r\\nThe Gold Rush stimulated economies around the world as well. Farmers in Chile, Australia, and Hawaii found a huge new market for their food; British manufactured goods were in high demand; clothing and even prefabricated houses arrived from China.[149] The return of large amounts of California gold to pay for these goods raised prices and stimulated investment and the creation of jobs around the world.[150] Australian prospector Edward Hargraves, noting similarities between the geography of California and his home country, returned to Australia to discover gold and spark the Australian gold rushes.[151] Preceding the Gold Rush, the United States was on a bi-metallic standard, but the sudden increase in physical gold supply increased the relative value of physical silver and drove silver money from circulation. The increase in gold supply also created a monetary supply shock.[152]\\r\\nWithin a few years after the end of the Gold Rush, in 1863, the groundbreaking ceremony for the western leg of the First Transcontinental Railroad was held in Sacramento. The line's completion, some six years later, financed in part with Gold Rush money,[153] united California with the central and eastern United States. Travel that had taken weeks or even months could now be accomplished in days.[154]\\r\\nCalifornia's name became indelibly connected with the Gold Rush, and fast success in a new world became known as the \\"California Dream.\\"[155] California was perceived as a place of new beginnings, where great wealth could reward hard work and good luck. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:\\r\\nThe old American Dream?... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin's \\"Poor Richard\\"...?of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream?... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter's Mill.[156]\\r\\nOvernight California gained the international reputation as the \\"golden state\\".[157] Generations of immigrants have been attracted by the California Dream. California farmers,[158] oil drillers,[159] movie makers,[160] airplane builders,[161] and \\"dot-com\\" entrepreneurs have each had their boom times in the decades after the Gold Rush.[162]\\r\\nIncluded among the modern legacies of the California Gold Rush are the California state motto, \\"Eureka\\" (\\"I have found it\\"), Gold Rush images on the California State Seal,[163] and the state nickname, \\"The Golden State\\", as well as place names, such as Placer County, Rough and Ready, Placerville (formerly named \\"Dry Diggings\\" and then \\"Hangtown\\" during rush time), Whiskeytown, Drytown, Angels Camp, Happy Camp, and Sawyers Bar. The San Francisco 49ers National Football League team, and the similarly named athletic teams of California State University, Long Beach, are named for the prospectors of the California Gold Rush.\\r\\nIn addition, the standard route shield of state highways in California is in the shape of a miner's spade to honor the California Gold Rush.[164][165] Today, aptly named State Route 49 travels through the Sierra Nevada foothills, connecting many Gold Rush-era towns such as Placerville, Auburn, Grass Valley, Nevada City, Coloma, Jackson, and Sonora.[166] This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many Gold Rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.\\r\\nThe literary history of the Gold Rush is reflected in the works of Mark Twain (The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County), Bret Harte (A Millionaire of Rough-and-Ready), Joaquin Miller (Life Amongst the Modocs), and many others.[27][167]","input":"How many miners were in the california gold rush?"},{"output":"political initiative","context":"Batho Pele (Sotho: \\"People First\\") is a South African political initiative.

He is currently a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Oxford.[3] He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,[4] and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November the same year.[5][6][7][8][9]\\r\\nBerners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).[10] He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),[11] and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.[12][13] In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.[14] He is a founder and president of the Open Data Institute.\\r\\nIn 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work.[15][16] In April 2009, he was elected a foreign associate of the United States National Academy of Sciences.[17][18] Named in Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century, Berners-Lee has received a number of other accolades for his invention.[19] He was honoured as the \\"Inventor of the World Wide Web\\" during the 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, in which he appeared in person, working with a vintage NeXT Computer at the London Olympic Stadium.[20] He tweeted \\"This is for everyone\\",[21] which instantly was spelled out in LCD lights attached to the chairs of the 80,000 people in the audience.[20] Berners-Lee received the 2016 Turing Award \\"for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBerners-Lee was born in London, England, United Kingdom,[23] one of four children born to Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee. His parents worked on the first commercially built computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973, at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.[1][15] A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.[24] He studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, from 1973 to 1976, where he received a first-class bachelor of arts degree in physics.[1][23]\\r\\nAfter graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[23] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.[23]\\r\\nBerners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.[25] To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.[26]\\r\\nAfter leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.[27] He ran the company's technical side for three years.[28] The project he worked on was a \\"real-time remote procedure call\\" which gave him experience in computer networking.[27] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.[26]\\r\\nIn 1989, CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet:\\r\\n\\"I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the Transmission Control Protocol and domain name system ideas andta-da!the World Wide Web[29] ... Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.\\"[30]\\r\\nBerners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall.[31] He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first Web browser. His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol daemon).\\r\\n\\"Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee].

Despite this being an international organisation hosted by Switzerland, the office that Berners-Lee used was just across the border in France.[33] It was put online on 6 August 1991 for the first time:\\r\\ninfo.cern.ch was the address of the world's first-ever web site and web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext, technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed. You may find a later copy (1992) on the World Wide Web Consortium website.[34]\\r\\nIt provided an explanation of what the World Wide Web was, and how one could use a browser and set up a web server.[35][36][37][38] In a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists, academics, writers, and world leaders, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one, with the entry stating, \\"The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the internet has changed the shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world\\".[39]\\r\\nIn 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.[40]\\r\\nIn 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset.[41] In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the Semantic Web.[42][43]\\r\\nIn a Times article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes (\\"//\\") in a web address were \\"unnecessary\\". He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web addresses without the slashes. \\"There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time\\", he said in his lighthearted apology.[44]\\r\\nIn June 2009, then-British Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced Berners-Lee would work with the UK government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.[45] Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free re-use. Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said that: \\"The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not tonot the other way around.\\" He went on to say: \\"Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.\\"[46]\\r\\nIn November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the World Wide Web Foundation in order to \\"advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change.\\"[47]\\r\\nBerners-Lee is one of the pioneer voices in favour of net neutrality,[48] and has expressed the view that ISPs should supply \\"connectivity with no strings attached\\", and should neither control nor monitor the browsing activities of customers without their expressed consent.[49][50] He advocates the idea that net neutrality is a kind of human network right: \\"Threats to the internet, such as companies or governments that interfere with or snoop on internet traffic, compromise basic human network rights.\\"[51] Berners-Lee participated in an open letter to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC). He and 20 other Internet pioneers urged the FCC to cancel a vote on 14 December 2017 to uphold net neutrality. The letter was adressed to Senator Roger Wicker, Senator Brian Schatz, Representative Marsha Blackburn and Representative Michael F. Doyle.[52]\\r\\nBerners-Lee joined the board of advisors of start-up State.com, based in London.[53] As of May 2012, Berners-Lee is president of the Open Data Institute,[54] which he co-founded with Nigel Shadbolt in 2012.\\r\\nThe Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Berners-Lee is leading the coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Facebook, Intel, and Microsoft. The A4AI seeks to make internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Berners-Lee will work with those aiming to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income.[55]\\r\\nBerners-Lee holds the founders chair in Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he heads the Decentralized Information Group and is leading Solid, a joint project with the Qatar Computing Research Institute that aims to radically change the way Web applications work today, resulting in true data ownership as well as improved privacy.[56] In October 2016, he joined the Department of Computer Science at Oxford University as a professorial research fellow[57] and as a fellow of Christ Church, one of the Oxford colleges.[58]\\r\\nBerners-Lee was married to Nancy Carlson in 1990; they had two children and divorced in 2011. In 2014, Berners-Lee married Rosemary Leith at St. James's Palace in London.[59] Leith is director of the World Wide Web Foundation and a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center. Previously, she was World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council Chair of the Future of Internet Security[60] and now is on the board of YouGov.[61]\\r\\nBerners-Lee was raised as an Anglican, but in his youth, he turned away from religion. After he became a parent, he became a Unitarian Universalist (UU).[62] He has stated: \\"Like many people, I had a religious upbringing which I rejected as a teenager... Like many people, I came back to religion when we had children\\".[63] He and his wife wanted to teach spirituality to his children, and after hearing a Unitarian minister and visiting the UU Church, they opted for it.[64] He is an active member of that church,[65] to which he adheres because he perceives it as a tolerant and liberal belief. He has said: \\"I believe that much of the philosophy of life associated with many religions is much more sound than the dogma which comes along with it. So I do respect them.\\"[63]\\r\\nBerners-Lee has received many awards and honours. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2004 New Year Honours \\"for services to the global development of the internet\\", and was invested formally on 16 July 2004.[15][16]\\r\\nOn 13 June 2007, he was appointed to the Order of Merit (OM), an order restricted to 24 (living) members.[66] Bestowing membership of the Order of Merit is within the personal purview of the Queen, and does not require recommendation by ministers or the Prime Minister. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001.[2] He has been conferred honorary degrees from a number of Universities around the world, including Manchester (his parents worked on the Manchester Mark 1 in the 1940s), Harvard and Yale.[67][68][69]\\r\\nIn 2012, Berners-Lee was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork ÿ the Beatles' Sgt.

It is the band's only album to feature guitarist Dennis Stratton.\\r\\nAlthough Iron Maiden have since criticised the quality of the album's production, the release was met with critical and commercial success, debuting at No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart as well as achieving prominence for the band in mainland Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was the band's only album produced by Will Malone, who Iron Maiden have since claimed lacked interest in the project and effectively left them to produce most of the album themselves, which, according to bassist Steve Harris, was completed in just 13 days.[2] Recording took place at Kingsway Studios, west London in January 1980,[3] with the band taking time out from the 1980 Metal for Muthas Tour to complete the final mixes at Morgan Studios, northwest London in February.[4] Prior to the sessions with Malone, the band made two attempts in December 1979 with two different producers while still a four-piece.[3] Guy Edwards, the first, was dismissed as the band were unhappy with the \\"muddy\\" quality in his production,[3] while Andy Scott was sacked after insisting that Harris use a pick rather than his fingers.[5] After these efforts, the band decided not to sack Malone as Steve Harris describes that they could \\"bypass him and [go] to the engineer.\\"[5] The group criticised the quality of the production, although many fans still prefer the raw quality of the sound recording.[2][6][7] Although AllMusic states that this style was \\"clearly drawing from elements of punk rock,\\"[8] Harris later stated that the band despised everything about punk.[9]\\r\\nThis was also the only studio album with guitarist Dennis Stratton, who, having been brought in as a last-minute placement, was sacked due to \\"musical differences\\" after the band's European tour in support of Kiss.[10] Suspicions were first raised during Iron Maiden's recording, when Stratton added Wishbone Ash-esque harmony guitars and backing vocals reminiscent of Queen to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", of which the rest of the band immediately disapproved and had removed.[11] Although Stratton states that he was not \\"trying to push the band in a new direction,\\"[11] Harris comments that it \\"really pointed up the difference between Den and us,\\"[12] after which he began to notice that \\"Dennis was so much more into playing stuff like \\"Strange World\\" than he was \\"Iron Maiden\\" or \\"Prowler\\", because it was more slow, melodic... when he was soloing on one of the heavier songs, it wasn't with quite the same passion.\\"[11][13]\\r\\nThe 1998 remastered album differs from the original with the addition of the song \\"Sanctuary\\", which had then only been released as a single in the UK in May 1980,[14] although it did also appear in the later US version of Iron Maiden, which was issued in August 1980.[15] The track originally appeared on the Metal for Muthas compilation,[16] but was re-recorded during the Iron Maiden sessions.[14] The re-release also features a different cover; a digital recreation by original artist Derek Riggs, with a portion of the original artwork instead being used on the disc itself.\\r\\nThe band undertook the Iron Maiden Tour in support of the album, during which they played their first ever concerts in mainland Europe,[17] where they were surprised to discover how successful Iron Maiden had been outside the UK, with Steve Harris commenting, \\"The prestige of doing so well in the UK had turned into a sort of word-of-mouth thing, and we'd turn up in places like Leiden, in Holland, places we'd never even heard of, and they'd have these massive banners waiting for us with \\"Iron Maiden Go Over The Top\\" written on them and all this. It was unreal.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\"Running Free\\" was released as a single on 8 February 1980, reaching No. 34 in the UK Singles Chart. The band also performed the song on the UK TV show Top of the Pops, refusing the usual tradition for artists to mime and thus becoming the first group to perform live on the show since The Who in 1972.[19] Vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who wrote the song's lyrics, describes it as \\"a very autobiographical song, though of course I've never spent the night in an LA jail. It's about being 16 and, like it says, just running wild and running free. It comes from my days as a skinhead.\\"[20] According to Classic Rock and Metal Hammer contributor Dave Ling, writing in the Metal for Muthas CD re-issue liner notes, \\"Sanctuary\\" was originally penned by guitarist Rob Angelo, a member of Iron Maiden in 1977, who was paid S300 for the song's rights.[21] The \\"Sanctuary\\" single was released on 7 June 1980 and charted at No. 29,[14] with the censored cover of Eddie, the band's mascot, standing over Margaret Thatcher's body earning the band publicity in the British press.[22] Managers Rod Smallwood and Andy Taylor's management company would be named after the song.[23]\\r\\nAlthough \\"Strange World\\" is credited solely to Harris, Paul Day, the band's original vocalist from 1975-1976, claimed that he also contributed to the song.[24] \\"Charlotte the Harlot\\", their only song to have been written by Dave Murray alone,[6] is the first of four Iron Maiden tracks which make reference to the fictional prostitute 'Charlotte,' although Murray states it was \\"based on a true story.\\"[25] The 7-minute epic \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is also one of Steve Harris's personal favourites and is still performed live relatively frequently. With lots of mood and time-changes, Harris marks it as \\"the first song Id written that was a bit more proggy.\\"[2] \\"Transylvania\\" is an instrumental piece, composed by Harris, which was later covered by Iced Earth on the album Horror Show.[26]\\r\\nOf all the album's songs, \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Running Free\\", \\"Sanctuary\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\" are the most frequently played in the band's concert tours, with the last being played at every show since the band's inception and signalling the arrival of Eddie onstage.[27] All of the record's songs, excluding \\"Strange World\\", have been recorded with Bruce Dickinson on vocals, either on live albums, studio B-Sides or both.[8] \\"Strange World\\" and \\"Transylvania\\" were the only songs not played on the \\"Eddie Rips Up The World Tour\\", 2005.\\r\\nFour songs (\\"Prowler\\", \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", \\"Running Free\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\") were covered for the 2008 tribute album Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine,[28] and an acoustic reinterpretation of \\"Prowler\\" was included in 2012's Across The Seventh Sea by the acoustic Iron Maiden tribute project Maiden uniteD.[29]\\r\\nWhen first issued in 1980, the album received immediate critical acclaim, with Geoff Barton, reviewing the album in Sounds, writing, \\"Heavy metal for the '80s, its blinding speed and rampant ferocity making most plastic heavy rock tracks from the '60s and '70s sound sloth-like and funeral-dirgey by comparison.\\"[6]\\r\\nSince its release, Iron Maiden has continued to receive praise from reviewers, with AllMusic proclaiming that the album \\"would still rank as a landmark even if the Dickinson years had never happened\\" as well as \\"no better place to hear how both punk and prog rock informed the new wave of British heavy metal.\\"[8] In addition, Sputnikmusic describes it as \\"one of the top debut albums in the world of heavy metal,\\" containing \\"the raw, aggressive power [which] defines the early years of the band.\\"[33]\\r\\nIron Maiden is one of two Iron Maiden albums listed in Robert Dimery's book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (The Number of the Beast is the other).[34] In 2017, it was ranked 13th on Rolling Stone's list of \\"100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time\\".[35]\\r\\nAll songs written and composed by Steve Harris, except where noted.\\r\\nProduction and performance credits are adapted from the album liner notes.[1][36][37]","input":"When did iron maiden release their first album?"},{"output":"Charles, Prince of Wales","context":"Succession to the British throne is determined by descent, gender (for people born before October 2011), legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701, restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover that are in \\"communion with the Church of England\\".[1] Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the son of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte. Fifth in line is Prince Henry, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Sixth in line is Prince Andrew, Duke of York, the Queen's second-eldest son. Any of the first six in line marrying without the sovereign's consent would be disqualified from succession.\\r\\nThe first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed Counsellors of State. Counsellors of State perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom is one of the 16 Commonwealth realms. Each of those countries has the same person as monarch and the same order of succession. In 2011, the prime ministers of the realms agreed unanimously to adopt a common approach to amending the rules on the succession to their respective Crowns so that absolute primogeniture would apply for persons born after the date of the agreement, instead of male-preference primogeniture, and the ban on marriages to Roman Catholics would be lifted, but the monarch would still need to be in communion with the Church of England. After the necessary legislation had been enacted in accordance with each realm's constitution, the changes took effect on 26 March 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNo official, complete version of the line of succession is currently maintained. The exact number, in remoter collateral lines, of the persons who would be eligible is uncertain. In 2001 genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner compiled a list of 4,973 living descendants of the Electress Sophia in order of succession, but did so disregarding Roman Catholic status.[3] When updated in January 2011, the number was more than five thousand.[4]\\r\\nThe annotated list below covers the first part of this line of succession, being limited to descendants of the sons of George V (the present Queen's grandfather). Persons named in italics are unnumbered either because they are deceased or because sources report them to be excluded from the succession. The order of the first sixteen numbered in the list is given on the official website of the British Monarchy;[1] other list numbers and exclusions are explained by annotations (\\"Notes and sources\\" below) and footnotes.\\r\\nNotes and sources:\\r\\nThe current succession law in the United Kingdom evolved from succession law in both England and Scotland. Originally in both countries, there were no fixed rules governing succession to the throne. The individual could have relied on inheritance, statute, election (by Parliament or by another body), nomination (by a reigning sovereign in his or her will), conquest or prescription (de facto possession of the Crown). It was often unclear which of these bases should take precedence; often, the outcome depended not on the legal strength of the claims, but on the political or military power of the claimants.\\r\\nHowever, over time, the default rule became male primogeniture: later monarchs coming to the throne by exception to this rule went to great lengths to explain and justify going against these rules, and to prove their rivals illegitimate. Eventually, Parliament asserted control of succession.\\r\\nIn 1485, Henry Tudor, a female-line descendant of a legitimated branch of the royal house of Lancaster, the House of Beaufort, assumed the English crown as Henry VII, after defeating Richard III, who was killed at the battle of Bosworth when leading a charge against Henry's standard. Richard was the last king of the House of York, and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. Henry declared himself king retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before his victory over Richard at Bosworth Field,[6] and caused Richard's Titulus Regius to be repealed and expunged from the Rolls of Parliament.[7] After Henry's coronation in London in October that year, his first parliament, summoned to meet at Westminster in November, enacted that \\"the inheritance of the crown should be, rest, remain and abide in the most royal person of the then sovereign lord, King Henry VII, and the heirs of his body lawfully coming.\\"[8]\\r\\nHenry VII was followed by his son, Henry VIII. Though his father descended from the Lancastrians, Henry VIII could also claim the throne through the Yorkist line, as his mother Elizabeth was the sister and heiress of Edward V. In 1542 Henry also assumed the title King of Ireland; this would pass down with the monarchs of England, and later Great Britain, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate crowns into that of the United Kingdom.\\r\\nHenry VIII's numerous marriages led to several complications over succession. Henry VIII was first married to Catherine of Aragon, by whom he had a daughter named Mary. His second marriage, to Anne Boleyn, resulted in a daughter named Elizabeth. Henry VIII had a son, Edward, by his third wife, Jane Seymour. An Act of Parliament passed in 1533 declared Mary illegitimate; another passed in 1536 did the same for Elizabeth. Though the two remained illegitimate, an Act of Parliament passed in 1544 allowed reinserting them, providing further \\"that the King should and might give, will, limit, assign, appoint or dispose the said imperial Crown and the other premises  by letters patent or last will in writing.\\" Mary and Elizabeth, under Henry VIII's will, were to be followed by descendants of the King's deceased sister Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk (he however excluded his niece Frances Brandon, Duchess of Suffolk). This will also excluded from the succession the descendants of Henry's eldest sister Margaret Tudor, who were the rulers of Scotland.\\r\\nWhen Henry VIII died in 1547, the young Edward succeeded him, becoming Edward VI. Edward VI was the first Protestant Sovereign to succeed to the rule of England. He attempted to divert the course of succession in his will to prevent his Catholic half-sister, Mary, from inheriting the throne. He excluded Mary and Elizabeth, settling on the Duchess of Suffolk's daughter, Lady Jane Grey. Jane was also originally excluded on the premise that no woman could reign over England. Nonetheless, the will, which originally referred to Jane's heirs-male, was amended to refer to Jane and her heirs-male. Upon Edward VI's death in 1553, Jane was proclaimed Queen of England. She was not universally recognised and after nine days she was overthrown by the popular Mary. As Henry VIII's will had been approved by an Act of Parliament in 1544, Edward's contravening will was unlawful and ignored.\\r\\nMary was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth, who broke with the precedents of many of her predecessors, and refused to name an heir. Whilst previous monarchs (including Henry VIII) had specifically been granted authority to settle uncertain successions in their wills, the Treasons Act 1571 asserted that Parliament had the right to settle disputes, and made it treason to deny Parliamentary authority. Wary of threats from other possible heirs, Parliament further passed the Act of Association 1584, which provided that any individual involved in attempts to murder the Sovereign would be disqualified from succeeding. (The Act was repealed in 1863.)\\r\\nThe House of Stewart (later Stuart) had ruled in Scotland since 1371. It had followed strict rules of primogeniture until the deposition and exile of Mary I in 1567; even then she was succeeded by her son, James VI.\\r\\nElizabeth I of England was succeeded by King James VI of Scotland, her first cousin twice removed, even though his succession violated Henry VIII's will, under which Lady Anne Stanley, heiress of Mary Tudor, Duchess of Suffolk, was supposed to succeed. James asserted that hereditary right was superior to statutory provision, and as King of Scotland was powerful enough to deter any rival. He reigned as James I of England, thus effecting the Union of the Crowns, although England and Scotland remained separate sovereign states until 1707. His succession was rapidly ratified by Parliament.[9]\\r\\nJames's eldest surviving son and successor, Charles I, was overthrown and beheaded in 1649. The monarchy itself was abolished. A few years later, it was replaced by the Protectorate under Oliver Cromwell, effectively a monarch with the title of Lord Protector rather than King. Cromwell had the right to name his own successor, which he exercised on his deathbed by choosing his son, Richard Cromwell. Richard was ineffective, and was quickly forced from office. Shortly afterwards, the monarchy was restored, with Charles I's son Charles II as King.\\r\\nJames II and VII, a Roman Catholic, followed his brother Charles II, despite efforts in the late 1670s to exclude him in favour of Charles's illegitimate Protestant son, the Duke of Monmouth. James was deposed when his Protestant opponents forced him to flee from England in 1688. Parliament then deemed that James had, by fleeing the realms, abdicated the thrones and offered the Crowns not to the King's infant son James but to his Protestant daughter Mary and to her husband William, who as James's nephew was the first person in the succession not descended from him. The two became joint Sovereigns (a unique circumstance in British history) as William III of England and Ireland (and II of Scotland) and Mary II of England, Scotland and Ireland. William had insisted on this unique provision as a condition of his military leadership against James.\\r\\nThe English Bill of Rights passed in 1689 determined succession to the English, Scottish and Irish Thrones. First in the line were the descendants of Mary II. Next came Mary's sister Princess Anne and her descendants. Finally, the descendants of William by any future marriage were added to the line of succession. Only Protestants were allowed to succeed to the Thrones, and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nAfter Mary II died in 1694, her husband continued to reign alone until his own death in 1702. The line of succession provided for by the Bill of Rights was almost at an end; William and Mary never had any children, and Princess Anne's children had all died. Therefore, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement. The Act maintained the provision of the Bill of Rights whereby William would be succeeded by Princess Anne and her descendants, and thereafter by his own descendants from future marriages. The Act, however, declared that they would be followed by James I & VI's granddaughter Sophia, Electress and Dowager Duchess of Hanover (the daughter of James's daughter Elizabeth Stuart), and her heirs. As under the Bill of Rights, non-Protestants and those who married Roman Catholics were excluded.\\r\\nUpon William's death, Anne became Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland. Because the Parliament of England settled on Sophia, Electress of Hanover as Anne's heir-presumptive without consulting Scottish leaders, the Estates of Scotland retaliated by passing the Scottish Act of Security. The Act provided that, upon the death of Anne, the Estates would meet to select an heir to the throne of Scotland, who could not be the same person as the English Sovereign unless numerous political and economic conditions were met. Anne originally withheld the Royal Assent, but was forced to grant it when the Estates refused to raise taxes and sought to withdraw troops from the Queen's army. England's Parliament responded by passing the Alien Act 1705, which threatened to cripple Scotland's economy by cutting off trade with them. Thus, Scotland had little choice but to unite with England to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707; the Crown of the new nation (along with the Crown of Ireland) was subject to the rules laid down by the English Act of Settlement.\\r\\nAnne was predeceased by Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and was therefore succeeded by the latter's son, who became George I in 1714.\\r\\nAttempts were made in the risings of 1715 and 1745 to restore Stuart claimants to the Throne, supported by those who recognised the Jacobite succession. The House of Hanover nonetheless remained undeposed, and the Crown descended in accordance with the appointed rules. In 1801, following the Acts of Union 1800, the separate crowns of Great Britain and Ireland were merged and became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Between 1811 and 1820, when George III was deemed unfit to rule, the Prince of Wales (later George IV) acted as his regent. Some years later the Regency Act 1830 made provision for a change in the line of succession had a child been born to William IV after his death, but this event did not come about.\\r\\nThe succession was next called into doubt in 1936, when Edward VIII abdicated in the same year as he succeeded to the throne immediately on his father's death. Edward was proclaimed King in January 1936,[10] and mounted the throne in the House of Lords for the first and last time at the opening of Parliament in November 1936, but he had not yet been crowned when he renounced the throne in December. Edward VIII had desired to marry Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, but the Church of England, of which the British Sovereign is Supreme Governor, would not authorise the marriage of divorcees. Consequently, Parliament passed His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, by which Edward VIII ceased to be Sovereign \\"immediately upon\\" his royal assent as King being signified in Parliament on 11 December. The Act provided that he and his descendants, if any, were not to have any \\"right, title or interest in or to the succession to the Throne\\". (In fact Edward died childless in 1972.)\\r\\nEdward's abdication was \\"a demise of the Crown\\" (in the words of the Act), and the Duke of York, his brother who was then next in the line, immediately succeeded to the throne and to its \\"rights, privileges, and dignities\\", taking the regnal name George VI. He in turn was succeeded in 1952 by his own elder daughter, Elizabeth II. By that time the monarch of the United Kingdom no longer reigned in the greater part of Ireland (which had become a republic in 1949), but was the monarch of a number of independent sovereign states (Commonwealth realms).\\r\\nIn the coronation ceremony the monarch customarily receives homage from peers of the realm, enthroned as sovereign of the United Kingdom on a chair placed for the purpose facing the altar in Westminster Abbey.[11] Each of the Commonwealth realms has the same person as monarch and, to maintain that arrangement, they have agreed to continue the same line of succession; some realms do so through domestic succession laws, while others stipulate whomever is monarch of the United Kingdom will also be monarch of that realm. In February 1952, on her accession, Elizabeth II was proclaimed as sovereign separately throughout her realms. In October 2011, the heads of government of all 16 realms agreed unanimously at a meeting held in Perth, Australia, to proposed changes to the royal succession laws that would see the order of succession for people born after 28 October 2011 governed by absolute primogeniturewherein succession passes to an individual's children according to birth order, regardless of genderinstead of male-preference primogeniture. They also agreed to lift a ban on those who marry Roman Catholics. The ban on Catholics themselves was retained to ensure that the monarch would be in communion with the Church of England.[12] The changes came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, after legislation was made according to each realm's constitution.[13][14]\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement (restated by the Acts of Union) still govern succession to the throne. They were amended in the United Kingdom by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which was passed mainly \\"to make succession to the Crown not depend on gender\\" and \\"to make provision about Royal Marriages\\" (according to its long title), thereby implementing the Perth Agreement in the UK and in those realms that, by their laws, have as their monarch automatically whoever is monarch of the UK. Other realms passed their own legislation.\\r\\nAnyone ineligible to succeed is treated as if they were \\"naturally dead\\". That individual's descendants are not also disqualified, unless they are personally ineligible.\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement 1701 provides that Protestant \\"heirs of the body\\" (that is, legitimate descendants) of Sophia, Electress of Hanover, are eligible to succeed to the throne, unless otherwise disqualified. The meaning of heir of the body is determined by the common law rules of male preference primogeniture (the \\"male-preference\\" criterion is no longer applicable, in respect of succession to the throne, to persons born after 28 October 2011), whereby older children and their descendants inherit before younger children, and a male child takes precedence over a female sibling.[15] Children born out of wedlock and adopted children are not eligible to succeed. Illegitimate children whose parents subsequently marry are legitimated, but remain ineligible to inherit the Crown.[n 3]\\r\\nThe Royal Marriages Act 1772 (repealed by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013) further required descendants of George II to obtain the consent of the reigning monarch to marry. (The requirement did not apply to descendants of princesses who married into foreign families, as well as, from 1936, any descendants of Edward VIII,[n 4] of which there are none.) The Act provided, however, that if a dynast older than twenty-five years notified the Privy Council of his or her intention to marry without the consent of the Sovereign, then he or she may have lawfully done so after one year, unless both houses of Parliament expressly disapproved of the marriage. A marriage that contravened the Royal Marriages Act was void, and the resulting offspring illegitimate and thus ineligible to succeed, though the succession of the dynast who failed to obtain consent was not itself affected. This also had the consequence that marriage to a Roman Catholic without permission was void, so that the dynast was not disqualified from succeeding on account of being married to a Roman Catholic. Thus when the future George IV attempted to marry the Roman Catholic Maria Fitzherbert in 1785 without obtaining permission from George III he did not disqualify himself from inheriting the throne in due course.[2] A marriage voided by the 1772 act prior to its repeal remains void \\"for all purposes relating to the succession to the Crown\\" under the 2013 act.[16]\\r\\nThe constitutional crisis arising from Edward VIII's decision to marry a divorcee in 1936 led to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which provided that Edward VIII and his descendants would have no claim to the throne.[17] The Act is no longer applicable, because Edward died in 1972 without issue.\\r\\nRules relating to eligibility established by the Bill of Rights are retained under the Act of Settlement. The preamble to the Act of Settlement notes that the Bill of Rights provides \\"that all and every person and persons that then [at the time of the Bill of Right's passage] were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the see or Church of Rome, or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded.\\"[18] The Act of Settlement continues, providing \\"that all and every Person and Persons who shall  is, are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the See or Church of Rome or shall profess the Popish religion or shall marry a papist shall be subject to such Incapacities\\"[19] as the Bill of Rights established.\\r\\nThe precise meaning of the aforementioned clauses is subject to contention. Under one interpretation, the religion of an individual at the precise moment of succession is relevant. Under another interpretation, anyone who has been a Roman Catholic at any time since 1689 (\\"then  or afterwards\\") is forever ineligible to succeed. The former interpretation allows a Roman Catholic to convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne just before a vacancy on the throne occurs devolving the crown on the first dynast in the line of succession; the latter does not. In either case, however, other denominations of faith are not affected; it is clear that any non-Catholic may convert to Protestantism and succeed to the Throne. It is a requirement that the monarch must be a Protestant.[1]\\r\\nThe Act of Settlement further provided that anyone who married a Roman Catholic was ineligible to succeed. The Act did not require that the spouse be Protestant; it only barred those who marry Roman Catholics. Since the passage of the Act it has been determined (in the case of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) that an individual is not barred because his or her spouse later converts to Roman Catholicism after their marriage. The Succession to the Crown Act 2013 removed the bar on individuals married to Roman Catholics, though not on Roman Catholics themselves.\\r\\nUnder the Treason Act 1702 and the Treason (Ireland) Act 1703, it is treason to \\"endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding ... to the imperial crown of this realm\\". Since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, the maximum penalty has been life imprisonment.\\r\\nFollowing the Perth Agreement, changes to the line of succession came into effect on 26 March 2015.[13][14] The positions of the first 27 in line remained unchanged, including Princess Anne and her children and grandchildren, until the birth of Princess Charlotte of Cambridge on 2 May 2015. The first to be affected by the changes, on the day they came into effect in March, were the children of Lady Davina Lewisher son Tne (born 2012) and her daughter Senna (born 2010)who were reversed in the order of succession, becoming 29th and 28th in line respectively.[20]\\r\\nUnder the 2013 Succession to the Crown Act, the first six persons in line to the throne must obtain the sovereign's approval before marrying.[16] Marriage without the Sovereign's consent disqualifies the person and the person's descendants from the marriage from succeeding to the Crown,[16] but the marriage is still legally valid.\\r\\nIn the Commonwealth realms, upon the death of a sovereign, the heir apparent or heir presumptive succeeds to the throne immediately, with no need for confirmation or further ceremony.[21][n 6] Nevertheless, the Accession Council meets and decides upon the making of the accession proclamation, which by custom has for centuries been ceremonially proclaimed in public places, in London, York, Edinburgh and other cities. The anniversary is observed throughout the sovereign's reign as Accession Day, including royal gun salutes in the United Kingdom.[23]\\r\\nFormerly, a new sovereign proclaimed his or her own accession. But on the death of Elizabeth I an Accession Council met to proclaim the accession of James I to the throne of England. James was then in Scotland and reigning as King James VI of Scotland. This precedent has been followed since. Now, the Accession Council normally meets in St James's Palace. Proclamations since James I's have usually been made in the name of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, the Privy Council, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and citizens of the City of London and \\"other principal Gentlemen of quality\\", though there have been variations in some proclamations. The proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II was the first to make mention of representatives of members of the Commonwealth.\\r\\nUpon his or her accession, a new sovereign is required by law to make and subscribe several oaths. The Bill of Rights of 1689 first required the sovereign to make a public declaration of non-belief in Roman Catholicism.[n 7] This declaration, known as the Accession Declaration, is required to be taken at either the first meeting of parliament of his or her reign (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation, whichever occurs first. The current wording of this declaration was adopted in 1910 as the previous wording was deemed to be controversial and overtly anti-Catholic. Rather than denouncing Roman Catholicism, the sovereign now declares him or herself to be a Protestant and that he or she will \\"uphold and maintain\\" the Protestant succession.[24] In addition to the Accession Declaration, the new sovereign is required by the Acts of Union 1707 to make an oath to \\"maintain and preserve\\" the Church of Scotland.[25] This oath is normally made at the sovereign's first meeting of the Privy Council following his or her accession. According to the Regency Act 1937, should the sovereign be under the age of 18, such oaths and declarations required to be taken by the sovereign shall be made upon his attainment of that age.[26]\\r\\nAfter a period of mourning,[27] the new sovereign is usually consecrated and crowned in Westminster Abbey. Normally, the Archbishop of Canterbury officiates, though the sovereign may designate any other bishop of the Church of England. A coronation is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet during his short reign was the undoubted king.","input":"Who is the successor to the british throne?"},{"output":"a White Cuban","context":"A White Russian is a cocktail made with vodka, coffee liqueur (e.g., Kahl~a or Tia Maria), and cream served with ice in an Old Fashioned glass.

It is unclear which drink preceded the other.[1][2]\\r\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary[3] refers to the first mention of the word \\"White Russian\\" in the sense of a cocktail as appearing in California's Oakland Tribune on November 21, 1965.[4] It was placed in the newspaper as an insert: \\"White Russian. 1 oz. each Southern, vodka, cream\\",[5] with \\"Southern\\" referring to Coffee Southern, a short-lived brand of coffee liqueur by Southern Comfort.[6]\\r\\nThough long regarded as a boring and unsophisticated drink, the White Russian saw a surge in popularity after the 1998 release of the film The Big Lebowski, throughout which it appears as the protagonist's beverage of choice.[7] Literary critic Craig Owens has examined the drink's role in the film, observing that its name and casual preparation reflect what he saw as the protagonist's New Left politics and \\"castrated masculinity\\".[8][9]\\r\\nAs with all cocktails, various modes of preparation exist, varying according to the recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists. Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur. Shaking the cream in order to thicken it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common. Sometimes the drink is prepared on the stove with hot coffee for a warm treat on cold days.\\r\\nMany variants of the cocktail exist, both localised and widely known, such as a White Canadian (made with goat's milk), an Anna Kournikova (named after the tennis player, made with skimmed milk, i.e. a \\"skinny, low-fat\\" White Russian), a White Cuban (made with rum instead of vodka), or a Dirty Russian (made with chocolate milk instead of cream).[10][11]","input":"What is a white russian with rum called?"},{"output":"Sir H. Rider Haggard","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nKing Solomon's Mines (1885) is a popular novel[1] by the English  Victorian adventure writer and fabulist Sir H. Rider Haggard. It tells of a search of an unexplored region of Africa by a group of adventurers led by Allan Quatermain for the missing brother of one of the party. It is the first English adventure novel set in Africa, and is considered to be the genesis of the Lost World literary genre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book was first published in September 1885 amid considerable fanfare, with billboards and posters around London announcing \\"The Most Amazing Book Ever Written\\". It became an immediate best seller. By the late 19th century, explorers were uncovering ancient civilisations around the world, such as Egypt's Valley of the Kings, and the empire of Assyria. Inner Africa remained largely unexplored and King Solomon's Mines, the first novel of African adventure published in English, captured the public's imagination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"King Solomon\\" of the book's title is the Biblical king renowned both for his wisdom and for his wealth. A number of sites have been suggested as the location of his mines, including the workings at the Timna valley near Eilat. Research published in September 2013 has shown that this site was in use during the 10th century BC as a copper mine possibly by the Edomites,[2][3] who the Bible reports were rivals of and frequently at war with King Solomon.[4][5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nHaggard knew Africa well, having travelled deep within the continent as a 19-year-old during the Anglo-Zulu War and the First Boer War, where he had been impressed by South Africa's vast mineral wealth and by the ruins of ancient lost cities being uncovered, such as Great Zimbabwe. His original Allan Quatermain character was based in large part on Frederick Courtney Selous, the British white hunter and explorer of Colonial Africa.[7][8] Selous's real-life experiences provided Haggard with the background and inspiration for this and many later stories.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaggard also owed a considerable debt to Joseph Thomson, the Scottish explorer whose book Through Masai Land was a hit in January 1885.[citation needed] Thomson claimed he had terrified warriors in Kenya by taking out his false teeth and claiming to be a magician, just as Captain Good does in King Solomon's Mines. Contemporary James Runciman wrote an article entitled King Plagiarism and His Court,[9] interpreted as accusing Haggard of plagiarism for this.[10][11] Thomson was so outraged at Haggard's alleged plagiarism that he published a novel of his own, Ulu: an African Romance, which, however, failed to sell.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllan Quatermain, an adventurer and white hunter based in Durban, in what is now South Africa, is approached by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. He has little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravelling by oxcart, they reach the edge of a desert, but not before a hunt in which a wounded elephant claims the life of a servant. They continue on foot across the desert, almost dying of thirst before finding the oasis shown halfway across on the map. Reaching a mountain range called Suliman Berg, they climb a peak (one of \\"Sheba's Breasts\\") and enter a cave where they find the frozen corpse of Jos Silvestre (also spelt Silvestra), the 16th-century Portuguese explorer who drew the map in his own blood. That night, a second servant dies from the cold, so they leave his body next to Silvestra's, to \\"give him a companion\\".\\r\\nThey cross the mountains into a raised valley, lush and green, known as Kukuanaland. The inhabitants have a well-organised army and society and speak an ancient dialect of IsiZulu. Kukuanaland's capital is Loo, the destination of a magnificent road from ancient times. The city is dominated by a central royal kraal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey soon meet a party of Kukuana warriors who are about to kill them when Captain Good nervously fidgets with his false teeth, making the Kukuanas recoil in fear. Thereafter, to protect themselves, they style themselves \\"white men from the stars\\"sorcerer-godsand are required to give regular proof of their divinity, considerably straining both their nerves and their ingenuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey are brought before King Twala, who rules over his people with ruthless violence. He came to power years before when he murdered his brother, the previous king, and drove his brother's wife and infant son, Ignosi, out into the desert to die. Twala's rule is unchallenged. An evil, impossibly ancient hag named Gagool is his chief advisor. She roots out any potential opposition by ordering regular witch hunts and murdering without trial all those identified as traitors. When she singles out Umbopa for this fate, it takes all Quatermain's skill to save his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nGagool, it appears, has already sensed what Umbopa soon after reveals: he is Ignosi, the rightful king of the Kukuanas. A rebellion breaks out, the Englishmen gaining support for Ignosi by taking advantage of their foreknowledge of a lunar eclipse to claim that they will black out the moon as proof of Ignosi's claim. (In early editions, this was a solar eclipse; Haggard changed it after realising that his description of a solar eclipse was not realistic[12]) The Englishmen join Ignosi's army in a furious battle. Although outnumbered, the rebels overthrow Twala, and Sir Henry lops off his head in a duel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Englishmen also capture Gagool, who reluctantly leads them to King Solomon's Mines. She shows them a treasure room inside a mountain, carved deep within the living rock and full of gold, diamonds, and ivory. She then treacherously sneaks out while they are admiring the hoard and triggers a secret mechanism that closes the mine's vast stone door. However, a brief scuffle with a beautiful Kukuana woman named Foulatawho had become attached to Good after nursing him through his injuries sustained in the battlecauses her to be crushed under the stone door, though not before fatally stabbing Foulata. Their scant store of food and water rapidly dwindling, the trapped men prepare to die also. After a few despairing days sealed in the dark chamber, they find an escape route, bringing with them a few pocketfuls of diamonds from the immense trove, enough to make them rich.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Englishmen bid farewell to a sorrowful Ignosi and return to the desert, assuring him that they value his friendship but must return to be with their own people, Ignosi in return promising them that they will be venerated and honoured among his people forever. Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaggard wrote the novel as a result of a five-shilling wager with his brother, who said that he could not write a novel half as good as Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883).[13][14] He wrote it in a short time, somewhere between six[13] and sixteen[12] weeks between January and 21 April 1885. However, the book was a complete novelty and was rejected by one publisher after another.  After six months, King Solomon's Mines was published, and the book became the year's best seller, with printers struggling to print copies fast enough.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the process, King Solomon's Mines created a new genre known as the \\"Lost World\\", which would inspire Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Land That Time Forgot, Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, Rudyard Kipling's The Man Who Would Be King[15] and H. P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness. Lee Falk's The Phantom was initially written in this genre. A much later Lost World novel was Michael Crichton's Congo, which involves a quest for King Solomon's lost mines, supposedly located in a lost African city called Zinj.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in Treasure Island, the narrator of King Solomon's Mines tells his tale in the first person in an easy conversational style. Almost entirely missing (except in the speech of the Kukuanas) is the ornate language usually associated with novels of this era. Haggard's use of the first person subjective perspective also contrasts with the omniscient third-person viewpoint then in vogue among influential writers such as Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy, and George Eliot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book has scholarly value for the colonialist attitudes that Haggard expresses,[16] and for the way that he portrays the relationships between the white and African characters. Haggard portrays some African characters as barbarians, such as Twala and Gagool, but their barbarity has more to do with their roles as antagonists in the story than with their African heritage. He also presents the other side of the coin, showing some black Africans as heroes and heroines (such as Ignosi), and showing respect for their culture. The book expresses much less prejudice than some of the later books in this genre. Indeed, Quatermain states that he refuses to use the word \\"nigger\\" and that many Africans are more worthy of the title of \\"gentleman\\" than the Europeans who settle or adventure in the country.[17] Haggard even includes an interracial romance between a Kukuana woman, Foulata, and the white Englishman Captain Good. The narrator tries to discourage the relationship, dreading the uproar that such a marriage would cause back home in England; however, he has no objection to the lady, whom he considers very beautiful and noble. Haggard eventually kills off Foulata, who dies in Good's arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nKukuanaland is said in the book to be forty leagues north of the Lukanga river in modern Zambia, which would place it in the extreme southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The culture of the Kukuanas shares many attributes with other South African tribes, such as Zulu being spoken and the kraal system being used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel has been adapted to film at least six times. The first version premiered in 1937, King Solomon's Mines, and was directed by Robert Stevenson. The best known version premiered in 1950, King Solomon's Mines, directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton, which was followed by a sequel, Watusi (1959). In 1979 a low-budget version was directed by Alvin Rakoff, King Solomon's Treasure, combining both King Solomon's Mines as well as Allan Quatermain in one story. The 1985 film, King Solomon's Mines, was a more tongue-in-cheek parody of the story, followed by a sequel in the same vein: Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold (1987). Around the same period an Australian animated TV film came out, King Solomon's Mines. In December 2006, the movie, The Librarian: Return to King Solomons Mines was released as the second in a trilogy that follows one mans fantastical adventures. In 2008 a direct-to-video adaptation, Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls was released by Mark Atkins, which bore more resemblance to Indiana Jones than the novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish comics artist Dudley D.

She was Queen of the United Kingdom and the Dominions from her husband's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952, after which she was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother,[2] to avoid confusion with her daughter. She was the last Empress of India.\\r\\nBorn into a family of British nobility, she came to prominence in 1923 when she married the Duke of York, the second son of King George V and Queen Mary. The couple and their daughters embodied traditional ideas of family and public service.[3] She undertook a variety of public engagements and became known for her consistently cheerful countenance.[4]\\r\\nIn 1936, her husband unexpectedly became king when his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated in order to marry the American divorce Wallis Simpson. Elizabeth then became queen. She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of the Second World War. During the war, her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public. In recognition of her role as an asset to British interests, Adolf Hitler described her as \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe\\".[5] After the war, her husband's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51. Her elder daughter, aged 25, became the new queen.\\r\\nFrom the death of Queen Mary in 1953 Elizabeth was viewed as the matriarch of the British royal family. In her later years, she was a consistently popular member of the family, even when other members were suffering from low levels of public approval.[6] She continued an active public life until just a few months before her death at the age of 101, seven weeks after the death of her younger daughter, Princess Margaret.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the youngest daughter and the ninth of ten children of Claude Bowes-Lyon, Lord Glamis (later the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne in the Peerage of Scotland), and his wife, Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. Her mother was descended from British Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, and Governor-General of India Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, who was the elder brother of another Prime Minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.[b]\\r\\nThe location of her birth remains uncertain, but reputedly she was born either in her parents' Westminster home at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, or in a horse-drawn ambulance on the way to a hospital.[9] Other possible locations include Forbes House in Ham, London, the home of her maternal grandmother, Louisa Scott.[10] Her birth was registered at Hitchin, Hertfordshire,[11] near the Strathmores' English country house, St Paul's Walden Bury, which was also given as her birthplace in the census the following year.[12] She was christened there on 23 September 1900, in the local parish church, All Saints, and her godparents included her paternal aunt Lady Maud Bowes-Lyon and cousin Venetia James.[13]\\r\\nShe spent much of her childhood at St Paul's Walden and at Glamis Castle, the Earl's ancestral home in Scotland. She was educated at home by a governess until the age of eight, and was fond of field sports, ponies and dogs.[14] When she started school in London, she astonished her teachers by precociously beginning an essay with two Greek words from Xenophon's Anabasis. Her best subjects were literature and scripture. After returning to private education under a German Jewish governess, K?the Kbler, she passed the Oxford Local Examination with distinction at age thirteen.[15]\\r\\nOn her fourteenth birthday, Britain declared war on Germany. Four of her brothers served in the army. Her elder brother, Fergus, an officer in the Black Watch Regiment, was killed in action at the Battle of Loos in 1915. Another brother, Michael, was reported missing in action on 28 April 1917.[16] Three weeks later, the family discovered he had been captured after being wounded. He remained in a prisoner of war camp for the rest of the war. Glamis was turned into a convalescent home for wounded soldiers, which Elizabeth helped to run. She was particularly instrumental in organising the rescue of the castle's contents during a serious fire on 16 September 1916.[17] One of the soldiers she treated wrote in her autograph book that she was to be \\"Hung, drawn, & quartered?... Hung in diamonds, drawn in a coach and four, and quartered in the best house in the land.\\"[18]\\r\\nPrince Albert, Duke of York\\"Bertie\\" to the familywas the second son of King George V. He initially proposed to Elizabeth in 1921, but she turned him down, being \\"afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to\\".[19] When he declared he would marry no other, his mother, Queen Mary, visited Glamis to see for herself the girl who had stolen her son's heart. She became convinced that Elizabeth was \\"the one girl who could make Bertie happy\\", but nevertheless refused to interfere.[20] At the same time, Elizabeth was courted by James Stuart, Albert's equerry, until he left the Prince's service for a better-paid job in the American oil business.[21]\\r\\nIn February 1922, Elizabeth was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Albert's sister, Princess Mary, to Viscount Lascelles.[22] The following month, Albert proposed again, but she refused him once more.[23] Eventually, in January 1923, Elizabeth agreed to marry Albert, despite her misgivings about royal life.[24] Albert's freedom in choosing Elizabeth, not a member of a royal family, though the daughter of a peer, was considered a gesture in favour of political modernisation; previously, princes were expected to marry princesses from other royal families.[25] They selected a platinum engagement ring featuring a Kashmir sapphire with two diamonds adorning its sides.[26]\\r\\nThey married on 26 April 1923, at Westminster Abbey. Unexpectedly,[27] Elizabeth laid her bouquet at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior on her way into the Abbey,[28] in memory of her brother Fergus.[29] Elizabeth became styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York.[30] Following a wedding breakfast at Buckingham Palace prepared by chef Gabriel Tschumi, the new Duchess and her husband honeymooned at Polesden Lacey, a manor house in Surrey, and then went to Scotland, where she caught \\"unromantic\\" whooping cough.[31]\\r\\nAfter a successful visit to Northern Ireland in July 1924, the Labour government agreed that Albert and Elizabeth could tour East Africa from December 1924 to April 1925.[32] The Labour government was defeated by the Conservatives in a general election in November (which Elizabeth described as \\"marvellous\\" to her mother)[33] and the Governor-General of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated three weeks later. Despite this, the tour went ahead, and they visited Aden, Kenya, Uganda, and Sudan, but Egypt was avoided because of political tensions.[34]\\r\\nAlbert had a stammer, which affected his ability to deliver speeches, and after October 1925, Elizabeth assisted in helping him through the therapy devised by Lionel Logue, an episode portrayed in the 2010 film The King's Speech. In 1926, the couple had their first child, Princess Elizabeth\\"Lilibet\\" to the familywho would later become Queen Elizabeth II. Another daughter, Princess Margaret Rose, was born four years later. Albert and Elizabeth, without their child, travelled to Australia to open Parliament House in Canberra in 1927.[35] She was, in her own words, \\"very miserable at leaving the baby\\".[36] Their journey by sea took them via Jamaica, the Panama Canal and the Pacific; Elizabeth fretted constantly over her baby back in Britain, but their journey was a public relations success.[37] She charmed the public in Fiji when, shaking hands with a long line of official guests, a stray dog walked in on the ceremony and she shook its paw as well.[38] In New Zealand she fell ill with a cold and missed some engagements, but enjoyed the local fishing[39] in the Bay of Islands accompanied by Australian sports fisherman Harry Andreas.[40] On the return journey, via Mauritius, the Suez Canal, Malta and Gibraltar, their transport, HMS?Renown, caught fire and they prepared to abandon ship before the fire was brought under control.[41]\\r\\nOn 20 January 1936, King George V died and Albert's brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, became King Edward VIII. George had expressed private reservations about his successor, saying, \\"I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.\\"[42]\\r\\nJust months into his reign, Edward forced a constitutional crisis by insisting on marrying the American divorce Wallis Simpson. Although legally Edward could have married Simpson, as King he was also head of the Church of England, which at that time did not allow divorced people to remarry. Edward's ministers believed that the people would never accept Simpson as Queen and advised against the marriage. As a constitutional monarch, Edward was obliged to follow ministerial advice.[43]\\r\\nRather than abandon his plans to marry Simpson, he chose to abdicate in favour of Albert,[44] who reluctantly became King in his place on 11 December 1936 under the regnal name of George VI. George VI and Elizabeth were crowned King and Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions, and Emperor and Empress of India in Westminster Abbey on 12 May 1937, the date previously scheduled for Edward VIII. Elizabeth's crown was made of platinum and was set with the Koh-i-Noor diamond.[45]\\r\\nEdward and Simpson married and became the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, but while Edward was a Royal Highness, George VI withheld the style from the Duchess, a decision that Elizabeth supported.[46] Elizabeth was later quoted as referring to the Duchess as \\"that woman\\",[47] and the Duchess referred to Elizabeth as \\"Cookie\\", because of her supposed resemblance to a fat Scots cook.[6] Claims that Elizabeth remained embittered towards the Duchess were denied by her close friends; the Duke of Grafton wrote that she \\"never said anything nasty about the Duchess of Windsor, except to say she really hadn't got a clue what she was dealing with.\\"[48]\\r\\nIn summer 1938, a state visit to France by the King and Queen was postponed for three weeks because of the death of the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. In two weeks, Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning.[49] The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany.[50] The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.[51]\\r\\nNevertheless, Nazi aggression continued, and the government prepared for war. After the Munich Agreement of 1938 appeared to forestall the advent of armed conflict, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was invited onto the balcony of Buckingham Palace with the King and Queen to receive acclamation from a crowd of well-wishers.[52] While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons, which led historian John Grigg to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as \\"the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century\\".[53] However, historians argue that the King only ever followed ministerial advice and acted as he was constitutionally bound to do.[54]\\r\\nIn May and June 1939, Elizabeth and her husband toured Canada from coast to coast and back, and visited the United States, spending time with President Roosevelt at the White House and his Hudson Valley estate.[55][56][57][58] U.S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt said that Elizabeth was \\"perfect as a Queen, gracious, informed, saying the right thing & kind but a little self-consciously regal\\".[59] The tour was designed to bolster trans-Atlantic support in the event of war, and to affirm Canada's status as an independent kingdom sharing with Britain the same person as monarch.[60][61][62][63]\\r\\nAccording to an often-told story, during one of the earliest of the royal couple's repeated encounters with the crowds, a Boer War veteran asked Elizabeth, \\"Are you Scots or are you English?\\" She replied, \\"I am a Canadian!\\"[64] Their reception by the Canadian and U.S. public was extremely enthusiastic,[65] and largely dissipated any residual feeling that George and Elizabeth were a lesser substitute for Edward.[66] Elizabeth told Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, \\"that tour made us\\",[67] and she returned to Canada frequently both on official tours and privately.[68]\\r\\nDuring the Second World War, the King and Queen became symbols of the fight against fascism.[69] Shortly after the declaration of war, The Queen's Book of the Red Cross was conceived. Fifty authors and artists contributed to the book, which was fronted by Cecil Beaton's portrait of the Queen and was sold in aid of the Red Cross.[70] Elizabeth publicly refused to leave London or send the children to Canada, even during the Blitz, when she was advised by the Cabinet to do so. She declared, \\"The children won't go without me. I won't leave the King. And the King will never leave.\\"[71]\\r\\nShe visited troops, hospitals, factories, and parts of Britain that were targeted by the German Luftwaffe, in particular the East End, near London's docks. Her visits initially provoked hostility; rubbish was thrown at her and the crowds jeered,[6] in part because she wore expensive clothes that served to alienate her from people suffering the deprivations of war. She explained that if the public came to see her they would wear their best clothes, so she should reciprocate in kind; Norman Hartnell dressed her in gentle colours and avoided black to represent \\"the rainbow of hope\\".[72] When Buckingham Palace itself took several hits during the height of the bombing, Elizabeth was able to say, \\"I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\\"[73]\\r\\nThough the King and Queen spent the working day at Buckingham Palace, partly for security and family reasons they stayed at night at Windsor Castle about 20 miles (32?km) west of central London with the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. The Palace had lost much of its staff to the army, and most of the rooms were shut.[74] The windows were shattered by bomb blasts, and had to be boarded up.[75] During the \\"Phoney War\\" the Queen was given revolver training because of fears of imminent invasion.[76]\\r\\nAdolf Hitler is said to have called her \\"the most dangerous woman in Europe\\" because he viewed her popularity as a threat to German interests.[5] However, before the war both she and her husband, like most of Parliament and the British public, had supported appeasement and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, believing after the experience of the First World War that war had to be avoided at all costs. After the resignation of Chamberlain, the King asked Winston Churchill to form a government. Although the King was initially suspicious of Churchill's character and motives, in due course both the King and Queen came to respect and admire him.[77][78]\\r\\nIn the 1945 British general election, Churchill's Conservative party was soundly defeated by the Labour party of Clement Attlee. Elizabeth's political views were rarely disclosed,[79] but a letter she wrote in 1947 described Attlee's \\"high hopes of a socialist heaven on earth\\" as fading and presumably describes those who voted for him as \\"poor people, so many half-educated and bemused. I do love them.\\"[80] Woodrow Wyatt thought her \\"much more pro-Conservative\\" than other members of the royal family,[81] but she later told him, \\"I like the dear old Labour Party.\\"[82] She also told the Duchess of Grafton, \\"I love communists\\".[83]\\r\\nDuring the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth's serene public behaviour was broken, exceptionally, when she rose from the royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility.[84] The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg.[85] In summer 1951, Queen Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place. In September, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.[86] After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, went in the King and Queen's place, in January 1952.[87] The King died in his sleep on 6 February 1952 while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London, as queen and prince consort.\\r\\nShortly after George VI's death, Elizabeth began to be styled as Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother because the normal style for the widow of a king, \\"Queen Elizabeth\\", would have been too similar to the style of her elder daughter, now Queen Elizabeth II.[88] Popularly, she became the \\"Queen Mother\\" or the \\"Queen Mum\\".[89] She was devastated by her husband's death and retired to Scotland. However, after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, she broke her retirement and resumed her public duties.[90] Eventually she became just as busy as queen mother as she had been as queen consort. In July 1953, she undertook her first overseas visit since the funeral when she visited the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland with Princess Margaret. She laid the foundation stone of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland ÿ the current University of Zimbabwe.[91] Upon her return to the region in 1957, Elizabeth was inaugurated as the College's President, and attended other events that were deliberately designed to be multi-racial.[92] During her daughter's extensive tour of the Commonwealth over 1953ÿ54, Elizabeth acted as a Counsellor of State and looked after her grandchildren, Charles and Anne.[93]\\r\\nElizabeth oversaw the restoration of the remote Castle of Mey, on the north coast of Scotland, which she used to \\"get away from everything\\"[94] for three weeks in August and ten days in October each year.[95] She developed her interest in horse racing, particularly steeplechasing, which had been inspired by the amateur jockey Lord Mildmay in 1949.[96]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth owned the winners of approximately 500 races. Her distinctive colours of blue with buff stripes were carried by horses such as Special Cargo, the winner of the 1984 Whitbread Gold Cup, and Devon Loch, which spectacularly halted just short of the winning post at the 1956 Grand National[97] and whose jockey Dick Francis later had a successful career as the writer of racing-themed detective stories. Peter Cazalet was her trainer for over 20 years. Although (contrary to rumour) she never placed bets, she did have the racing commentaries piped direct to her London residence, Clarence House, so she could follow the races.[98] As an art collector, she purchased works by Claude Monet, Augustus John and Peter Carl Faberg, among others.[99]\\r\\nIn February 1964, Elizabeth had an emergency appendectomy, which led to the postponement of a planned tour of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji until 1966.[100] She recuperated during a Caribbean cruise aboard the royal yacht, Britannia.[101] In December 1966, she underwent an operation to remove a tumour after she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Contrary to rumours, she did not have a colostomy.[102][103] In 1984, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and a lump was removed from her breast. Her bouts with cancer were never made public during her lifetime.[104]\\r\\nIn 1982, Queen Elizabeth was rushed to hospital when a fish bone became stuck in her throat, and had an operation to remove it. Being a keen angler, she calmly joked afterwards, \\"The salmon have got their own back.\\"[105] Similar incidents occurred at Balmoral in August 1986, when she was hospitalised at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary overnight but no operation was needed,[106] and May 1993, when she was admitted to the Infirmary for surgery under general anaesthetic.[107]\\r\\nIn 1975, Queen Elizabeth visited Iran at the invitation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The British ambassador and his wife, Anthony and Sheila Parsons, noted how the Iranians were bemused by her habit of speaking to everyone regardless of status or importance, and hoped the Shah's entourage would learn from the visit to pay more attention to ordinary people.[108] Between 1976 and 1984, she made annual summer visits to France,[109] which were among 22 private trips to continental Europe between 1963 and 1992.[110]\\r\\nIn her later years, the Queen Mother became known for her longevity. Her 90th birthday4 August 1990was celebrated by a parade on 27 June that involved many of the 300 organisations of which she was patron.[111] In 1995, she attended events commemorating the end of the war fifty years before, and had two operations: one to remove a cataract in her left eye, and one to replace her right hip.[112] In 1998, her left hip was replaced after it was broken when she slipped and fell during a visit to Sandringham stables.[113]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth's 100th birthday was celebrated in a number of ways: a parade that celebrated the highlights of her life included contributions from Sir Norman Wisdom and Sir John Mills;[114] her image appeared on a special commemorative S20 note issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland;[115] and she attended a lunch at the Guildhall, London, at which George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, accidentally attempted to drink her glass of wine. Her quick admonition of \\"That's mine!\\" caused widespread amusement.[116] In November 2000, she broke her collarbone in a fall that kept her recuperating at home over Christmas and the New Year.[117]\\r\\nOn 1 August 2001, Queen Elizabeth had a blood transfusion for anaemia after suffering from mild heat exhaustion, though she was well enough to make her traditional appearance outside Clarence House three days later to celebrate her 101st birthday.[118][119] Her final public engagements included planting a cross at the Field of Remembrance on 8 November 2001;[120] a reception at the Guildhall, London, for the reformation of the 600 Squadron, Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 15 November;[121] and attending the re-commissioning of HMS?Ark Royal on 22 November.[122]\\r\\nIn December 2001, aged 101, Elizabeth fractured her pelvis in a fall. Even so, she insisted on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year.[123] Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed.[124] She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week,[125] even though the Queen and the rest of the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor;[126] she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be takenshe insisted that she be shielded from the press[126]she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blackedÿout windows,[127][128] which had been previously used by Margaret.[126][129]\\r\\nOn 5 March 2002, Queen Elizabeth was present at the luncheon of the annual lawn party of the Eton Beagles, and watched the Cheltenham Races on television; however, her health began to deteriorate precipitately during her last weeks after retreating to Royal Lodge for the final time.[130]\\r\\nOn 30 March 2002, at 15:15 (GMT), the Queen Mother died in her sleep at the Royal Lodge, Windsor Great Park, with her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, at her bedside. She had been suffering from a cold for the previous four months.[124] At 101?years and 238?days old she was the longest-lived member of the royal family in British history. Her last surviving sister-in-law Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester,[131] exceeded that, dying aged 102 on 29 October 2004.[132]\\r\\nElizabeth grew camellias in every one of her gardens, and before her flag-draped coffin was taken from Windsor to lie in state at Westminster Hall, an arrangement of camellias from her own gardens was placed on top.[133] An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster.[134] Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respectan honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying in state of King George V.[135][136]\\r\\nOn the day of her funeral, 9 April, the Governor General of Canada issued a proclamation asking Canadians to honour Elizabeth's memory that day.[137] In Australia, the Governor-General read the lesson at a memorial service held in St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney.[138]\\r\\nIn London, more than a million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the 23-mile (37?km) route from central London to Elizabeth's final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[139] At her request, after her funeral the wreath that had lain atop her coffin was placed on the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior, in a gesture that echoed her wedding-day tribute 79 years before.[140]\\r\\nElizabethknown for her personal and public charm[19]was one of the most popular members of the royal family,[141] and helped to stabilise the popularity of the monarchy as a whole.[142][143]\\r\\nCritics included Kitty Kelley, who falsely alleged that during the Second World War Elizabeth did not abide by the rationing regulations.[144][145] This, however, was contradicted by the official records,[146][147] and Eleanor Roosevelt during her wartime stay at Buckingham Palace reported expressly on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted.[148][149]\\r\\nFurther allegations that Elizabeth used racist slurs to refer to black people[144] were strongly denied by Major Colin Burgess.[150] Major Burgess was the husband of Elizabeth Burgess, a mixed-race secretary who accused members of the Prince of Wales's Household of racial abuse.[151] Queen Elizabeth made no public comments on race, but according to Robert Rhodes James in private she \\"abhorred racial discrimination\\" and decried apartheid as \\"dreadful\\".[152] Woodrow Wyatt records in his diary that when he expressed the view that non-white countries have nothing in common with \\"us\\", she told him, \\"I am very keen on the Commonwealth. They're all like us.\\"[153] However, she did distrust Germans; she told Woodrow Wyatt, \\"Never trust them, never trust them.\\"[154] While she may have held such views, it has been argued that they were normal for British people of her generation and upbringing, who had experienced two vicious wars with Germany.[155]\\r\\nIn 1987, Queen Elizabeth was criticised when it emerged that two of her nieces, Katherine and Nerissa Bowes-Lyon, had both been committed to a psychiatric hospital because they were severely handicapped. However, Burke's Peerage had listed the sisters as dead, apparently because their mother, Fenella (the Queen Mother's sister-in-law), \\"was 'extremely vague' when it came to filling in forms and might not have completed the paperwork for the family entry correctly\\".[156] When Nerissa died the year before, her grave was originally marked with a plastic tag and a serial number. The Queen Mother said that the news of their institutionalisation came as a surprise to her.[157]\\r\\nSir Hugh Casson said Elizabeth was like \\"a wave breaking on a rock, because although she is sweet and pretty and charming, she also has a basic streak of toughness and tenacity.?... when a wave breaks on a rock, it showers and sparkles with a brilliant play of foam and droplets in the sun, yet beneath is really hard, tough rock, fused, in her case, from strong principles, physical courage and a sense of duty.\\"[158] Sir Peter Ustinov described her during a student demonstration at the University of Dundee in 1968:\\r\\nAs we arrived in a solemn procession the students pelted us with toilet rolls. They kept hold of one end, like streamers at a ball, and threw the other end. The Queen Mother stopped and picked these up as though somebody had misplaced them. [Returning them to the students she said,] 'Was this yours? Oh, could you take it?' And it was her sang-froid and her absolute refusal to be shocked by this, which immediately silenced all the students. She knows instinctively what to do on those occasions. She doesn't rise to being heckled at all; she just pretends it must be an oversight on the part of the people doing it. The way she reacted not only showed her presence of mind, but was so charming and so disarming, even to the most rabid element, that she brought peace to troubled waters.[159]\\r\\nElizabeth was well known for her dry witticisms. On hearing that Edwina Mountbatten was buried at sea, she said: \\"Dear Edwina, she always liked to make a splash.\\"[105] Accompanied by the gay writer Sir No?l Coward at a gala, she mounted a staircase lined with Guards. Noticing Coward's eyes flicker momentarily across the soldiers, she murmured to him: \\"I wouldn't if I were you, No?l; they count them before they put them out.\\"[160]\\r\\nAfter being advised by a Conservative Minister in the 1970s not to employ homosexuals, the Queen Mother observed that without them, \\"we'd have to go self-service\\".[160] On the fate of a gift of a nebuchadnezzar of champagne (20 bottles' worth) even if her family did not come for the holidays, she said, \\"I'll polish it off myself.\\"[161] Emine Saner of The Guardian suggests that with a gin and Dubonnet at noon, red wine with lunch, a port and martini at 6?pm and two glasses of champagne at dinner, \\"a conservative estimate puts the number of alcohol units she drank at 70 a week\\".[162] Her lifestyle amused journalists, particularly when it was revealed she had a multi-million pound overdraft with Coutts Bank.[163]\\r\\nHer habits were parodied by the satirical 1980s television programme Spitting Image.[164] She was portrayed by Juliet Aubrey in Bertie and Elizabeth, Sylvia Syms in The Queen, Natalie Dormer in W.E., Olivia Colman in Hyde Park on Hudson, Victoria Hamilton in The Crown, and in The King's Speech by Helena Bonham Carter, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal.[165][166]\\r\\nThe Cunard White Star Line's RMS Queen Elizabeth was named after her. She launched the ship on 27 September 1938 in Clydebank, Scotland. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before Elizabeth could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach.[167] In 1954, Queen Elizabeth sailed to New York on her namesake.[168]\\r\\nA statue of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother by sculptor Philip Jackson was unveiled in front of the George VI Memorial, off The Mall, London, on 24 February 2009, creating the George VI and Queen Elizabeth Memorial.[169]\\r\\nIn March 2011, her eclectic musical taste was revealed when details of her small record collection kept at the Castle of Mey were made public. Her records included ska, local folk, Scottish reels and the musicals Oklahoma! and The King and I, and artists such as yodeller Montana Slim, Tony Hancock, The Goons and No?l Coward.[170]\\r\\nEight years before her death, she had reportedly placed two-thirds of her money into trusts, for the benefit of her great-grandchildren. She left the bulk of her estate, estimated to be worth S70?million, including paintings, Faberg eggs, jewellery, and horses, to her surviving daughter, Queen Elizabeth II.[171] As property passing from monarch to monarch is exempt from Inheritance Tax, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch, a tax liability estimated at S28?million (40 percent of the value of the estate) was not incurred.[172] The most important pieces of art were transferred to the Royal Collection by Elizabeth II.[171]\\r\\nQueen Elizabeth's coat of arms was the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom (in either the English or the Scottish version) impaled with the arms of her father, the Earl of Strathmore; the latter being: 1st and 4th quarters, Argent, a lion rampant Azure, armed and langued Gules, within a double tressure flory-counter-flory of the second (Lyon); 2nd and 3rd quarters, Ermine, three bows stringed paleways proper (Bowes).[173] The shield is surmounted by the imperial crown, and supported by the crowned lion of England and a lion rampant per fess Or and Gules.[174]","input":"What is the queen mother's full name?"},{"output":"Kalawao County","context":"Loving County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. With a population of 113 as of a 2016[update] estimate by the United States Census Bureau, Loving County is the second least populous county in the United States, being above Kalawao County, Hawaii with a population of 88.[1] Loving County has no incorporated communities; its county seat and only community is Mentone.[2] The county was originally created in 1887, although after being disorganized, it was finally reorganized in 1931.[3]\\r\\nPart of the Haley Ranch, founded by the father of Texas historian J. Evetts Haley, is in Loving County, with another portion in neighboring Winkler County.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrehistorically, the area had many springs with potable water that supported wildlife and nomadic hunters. Antonio de Espejo visited the area in 1583 and crossed the Pecos River. Having surveyed the area in 1854 for a railroad company, John Pope returned in 1855 to start a camp in northwestern Loving County and establish artesian wells in the area, but the venture was unsuccessful and was abandoned in 1861.\\r\\nFrom 1837 to 1874, the area of modern Loving County was part of the Bexar land district. In 1874 it was separated from Bexar County, becoming a part of Tom Green County.\\r\\nLoving County is named for Oliver Loving,[4] a cattle rancher and pioneer of the cattle drive who, along with Charles Goodnight, developed the Goodnight-Loving Trail. He was mortally wounded by members of the Comanche nation while on a cattle drive in 1867 in the vicinity of the county.\\r\\nLoving is the only county in Texas to be incorporated twice, first in 1893 and again in 1931. Its initial organization was effected by a canal company founded in Denver, Colorado, and appears to have been based upon fraud and willful misrepresentations made by the founders to state officials.[5] After a local landowner hired a New York City firm to investigate alleged improprieties in county government, the company's organizers fled, taking with them all the county records. The state legislature subsequently disincorporated Loving in 1897, attaching it to Reeves County.\\r\\nOil was discovered in 1921, leading to a population increase in Loving County. By 1930, there were 195 residents, mostly living in what would become the town of Mentone, which became the county seat when Loving was reconstituted in 1931. By 1933, the population had peaked at 600, only to begin a steady decline which had continued until recently.\\r\\nLoving County was the home of the first elected female sheriff in Texas, Edna Reed Clayton Dewees. Dewees was appointed to the job in January 1945, then won an election to continue in the office through 1947. She never carried a firearm, and reported only two arrests during her entire term. Later she would return as a county district clerk, a job she held from 1965 to 1986. After retirement she lived on a ranch near Mentone[6] until 22 January 2009 when she died in Del Rio.[7]\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 677 square miles (1,750?km2), of which 669 square miles (1,730?km2) is land and 7.8 square miles (20?km2) (1.1%) is water.[8]\\r\\nThe Pecos River is the county's western boundary, forming the Red Bluff Reservoir along its northwestern border with Reeves County, Texas and Eddy County, New Mexico. The terrain of Loving County is described as flat desert, with a few low hills. Desert shrubs, range grass and cacti abound, with salt cedars along the river. Elevations vary from 2,686 to 3,311 feet (1,009?m) above sea level.\\r\\nLoving is the smallest county by area in the Permian Basin region.\\r\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 67 people, 31 households, and 19 families living in the county. The population density was 0.1 people per square mile (0.03/km2). There were 70 housing units at an average density of 0.1 per square?mile (0.04/km2). Of the 67 residents, 60 identified as White, no person identified themselves as Black, African American, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander. 6 identified as \\"some other race\\", and 1 person identified as belonging to two or more races. In addition, 7 people identified as being of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin of any race.

Ten households were made up of individuals and 2 consisted of someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. Average household size was 2.16, while the average family size was 2.65.\\r\\nIn the county, the population was spread out with 13 people under the age of 18, one between 18 and 24, 18 from 25 to 44, 24 from 45 to 64, and 11 who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 10 females there are 11.61 males. For every 10 females age 18 and over, there are 12.50 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the county was $40,000, and the median income for a family was $53,750. Males had a median income of $25,833 versus $0 for females.

In humans and some other mammals the secretion is alpha-amylase, also known as ptyalin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salivary glands are detailed below:\\r\\nThe two parotid glands are major salivary glands wrapped around the mandibular ramus in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to facilitate mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the ptyalin. It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity.\\r\\nThe submandibular glands are a pair of major salivary glands located beneath the lower jaws, superior to the digastric muscles. The secretion produced is a mixture of both serous fluid and mucus, and enters the oral cavity via the submandibular duct or Wharton duct. Approximately 65-70% of saliva in the oral cavity is produced by the submandibular glands, even though they are much smaller than the parotid glands.You can usually feel this gland, as it is in the superficial cervical region and feels like a rounded ball. It is located about two fingers above the Adam's apple (laryngeal prominence) and about two inches apart under the chin.\\r\\nThe sublingual glands are a pair of major salivary glands located inferior to the tongue, anterior to the submandibular glands. The secretion produced is mainly mucous in nature; however, it is categorized as a mixed gland. Unlike the other two major glands, the ductal system of the sublingual glands does not have intercalated ducts and usually does not have striated ducts either, so saliva exits directly from 8-20 excretory ducts known as the Rivinus ducts. Approximately 5% of saliva entering the oral cavity comes from these glands.\\r\\nThere are 800-1000 minor salivary glands located throughout the oral cavity within the submucosa[1] of the oral mucosa in the tissue of the buccal, labial, and lingual mucosa, the soft palate, the lateral parts of the hard palate, and the floor of the mouth or between muscle fibers of the tongue.[2] They are 1-2mm in diameter and unlike the major glands, they are not encapsulated by connective tissue, only surrounded by it. The gland has usually a number of acini connected in a tiny lobule. A minor salivary gland may have a common excretory duct with another gland, or may have its own excretory duct. Their secretion is mainly mucous in nature (except for Von Ebner glands- see next section) and have many functions such as coating the oral cavity with saliva. Problems with dentures are sometimes associated with minor salivary glands if there is dry mouth present (see further discussion).[1] The minor salivary glands are innervated by the seventh cranial or facial nerve.[2]\\r\\nVon Ebner's glands are glands found in a trough circling the circumvallate papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue near the terminal sulcus. They secrete a purely serous fluid that begins lipid hydrolysis. They also facilitate the perception of taste through secretion of digestive enzymes and proteins.[1] The arrangement of these glands around the circumvallate papillae provides a continuous flow of fluid over great number of taste bud along the sides of the papillae. It is important for dissolving the food particles to be tested.\\r\\nSalivary glands are innervated, either directly or indirectly, by the parasympathetic and sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic stimulation evokes a copious flow of saliva. In contrast, sympathetic stimulation produces either a small flow, which is rich in protein, or no flow at all.[3]\\r\\nThe gland is internally divided into lobules. Blood vessels and nerves enter the glands at the hilum and gradually branch out into the lobules.\\r\\nSecretory cells are found in a group, or acinus (plural, acini). Each acinus is located at the terminal part of the gland connected to the ductal system, with many acini within each lobule of the gland. Each acinus consists of a single layer of cuboidal epithelial cells surrounding a lumen, a central opening where the saliva is deposited after being produced by the secretory cells. The three forms of acini are classified in terms of the type of epithelial cell present and the secretory product being produced: serous, mucoserous and mucous.[5]\\r\\nIn the duct system, the lumina are formed by intercalated ducts, which in turn join to form striated ducts. These drain into ducts situated between the lobes of the gland (called interlobar ducts or secretory ducts). These are found on most major and minor glands (exception may be the sublingual gland).[5]\\r\\nAll of the human salivary glands terminate in the mouth, where the saliva proceeds to aid in digestion. The saliva that salivary glands release is quickly inactivated in the stomach by the acid that is present there but the saliva also contains enzymes that are actually activated by the acid.\\r\\nAbout 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 60% of these genes are expressed in normal, adult salivary glands[6][7]. Less than 100 genes are more specifically expressed in the salivary gland. The salivary gland specific genes are mainly genes that encode for secreted proteins and compared to other organs in the human body, the salivary gland has the highest fraction of secreted genes. The heterogeneous family of proline-rich, human salivary glycoproteins, such as PRB1 and PRH1, are salivary gland specific proteins with highest level of expression. Examples of other specifically expressed proteins include the digestive amylase enzyme AMY1A, the mucin MUC7 and statherin, all of major importance for specific characteristics of saliva.\\r\\nA sialogram is a radiocontrast study of a salivary duct that may be used to investigate its function.\\r\\nA salivary calculus may cause blockage of the ducts, causing pain and swelling of the gland. These are most commonly found in the submandibular gland ducts.\\r\\nSaliva production may be pharmacologically stimulated by sialagogues such as pilocarpine and cevimeline. It can also be suppressed by so-called antisialagogues such as tricyclic antidepressants, SSRIs, antihypertensives, and polypharmacy.[8] Cancer treatments including chemotherapy and radiation therapy may impair salivary flow. Radiation therapy may cause permanent hyposalivation due to injury to the oral mucosa containing the salivary glands, resulting in dry mouth or xerostomia, whereas chemotherapy may cause only temporary salivary impairment.\\r\\nGraft versus host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may manifest as dry mouth and many small mucoceles.\\r\\nTumours of the salivary glands may occur, including mucoepidermoid carcinoma.\\r\\nA unique commensal community of microorganisms, or bacteria, are present in the health salivary glands. During the study of this biome, many new genera of bacteria were discovered that had not been seen before.\\r\\nAging of salivary glands show some structural changes:[9][10][11]\\r\\nIn addition to that, there would be some changes in salivary contents:\\r\\nHowever, there is no overall change in the amount of saliva secreted.\\r\\nThe salivary glands of some species however, are modified to produce proteins; salivary amylase is found in many, but by no means all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands.[8] In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.","input":"What gland is also known as the mixed gland?"},{"output":"Abraham Lincoln","context":"During the history of the United States, eight presidents have died in office.[1] Of those eight, four were assassinated and four died of natural causes.[2] In all eight cases, the Vice President of the United States took over the office of presidency as part of the United States presidential line of succession.[3]\\r\\nWilliam Henry Harrison holds the record for shortest term served, holding the office of presidency for 31 days before dying.

I ask nothing more.\\" Harrison served the shortest term of any American president: March 4?ÿ April 4, 1841, 30 days, 12 hours, and 30 minutes.[15][16]\\r\\nHarrison's funeral took place in the Wesley Chapel in Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 7, 1841.[17] His original interment was in the public vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. He was later buried in North Bend, Ohio. The William Henry Harrison Tomb State Memorial was erected in his honor.[18]\\r\\nOn July 4, 1850, Taylor was known to have consumed copious amounts of ice water, cold milk, green apples, and cherries after attending holiday celebrations and the laying of the cornerstone of the Washington Monument.[19] That same evening, he became severely ill with an unknown digestive ailment. Doctors used popular treatments of the time. Taylor died in the White House at 10:35?p.m. on July 9, five days after becoming ill.[20] Contemporary reports listed the cause of death as \\"bilious diarrhea, or a bilious cholera\\".[21] He was succeeded by Vice President Millard Fillmore.\\r\\nThe cause of Zachary Taylor's death was fully established in 2001.[22] Almost immediately after his death, rumors began to circulate that Taylor was poisoned by pro-slavery Southerners, and similar theories persisted into the twentieth century.[23] The remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner on June?17, 1991. Neutron activation analysis conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory revealed no evidence of poisoning, as arsenic levels were too low.[24][25] The analysis concluded Taylor had contracted \\"cholera morbus, or acute gastroenteritis\\", as Washington had open sewers, and his food or drink may have been contaminated.[26]\\r\\nTaylor was interred in the Public Vault of the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. from July 13, 1850 to October 25, 1850. (It was built in 1835 to hold remains of notables until either the grave site could be prepared or transportation arranged to another city.) His body was transported to the Taylor Family plot where his parents are buried, on the old Taylor homestead plantation known as 'Springfield' in Louisville, Kentucky.[27]\\r\\nThe assassination of Abraham Lincoln took place on Good Friday,[28] on April 14, 1865, as the American Civil War was drawing to a close. The assassination occurred five days after the commanding General of the Army of Northern Virginia, Robert E. Lee, surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant and the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln was the first American president to be assassinated,[29] though an unsuccessful attempt had been made on Andrew Jackson 30 years before in 1835.[30]\\r\\nThe assassination of Lincoln was planned and carried out by the well-known stage actor John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and a strong opponent of the abolition of slavery in the United States.[31] Booth and a group of co-conspirators originally plotted to kidnap Lincoln, but later planned to kill him, Vice President Andrew Johnson, and Secretary of State William H. Seward in a bid to help the Confederacy's cause.[32] (Vice President Johnson's assailant did not carry out his part of the plan, and Johnson succeeded Lincoln as President.)\\r\\nLincoln was shot once in the back of his head while watching the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. at around 10:15 pm on the night of April 14, 1865.[33] An army surgeon who happened to be at Ford's, Doctor Charles Leale, assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal.[34] The unconscious President was then carried across the street from the theater to the Petersen House, where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22?a.m. on April 15.[35][36][37]\\r\\nThe assassination of James A. Garfield took place in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau at 9:30?am, less than four months into Garfield's term as the 20th President of the United States. Garfield died eleven weeks later on September 19, 1881. His Vice President, Chester A. Arthur, succeeded Garfield as President. Garfield also lived the longest after the shooting, compared to other assassinated Presidents. Garfield was scheduled to leave Washington on July 2, 1881 for his summer vacation.[40] On that day, Guiteau lay in wait for the President at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad station, on the southwest corner of present-day Sixth Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C.[41]\\r\\nPresident Garfield came to the Sixth Street Station on his way to his alma mater, Williams College, where he was scheduled to deliver a speech. Garfield was accompanied by two of his sons, James and Harry, and Secretary of State Blaine. Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln waited at the station to see the President off.[42] Garfield had no bodyguard or security detail; with the exception of Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, early U.S. presidents never used any guards.[43]\\r\\nAs President Garfield entered the waiting room of the station Guiteau stepped forward and pulled the trigger from behind at point-blank range. \\"My God, what is that?\\" Garfield cried out, flinging up his arms. Guiteau fired again and Garfield collapsed.[44] One bullet grazed Garfield's shoulder; the other hit him in the back, passing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord before coming to rest behind his pancreas.[45]\\r\\nGarfield, conscious but in shock, was carried to an upstairs floor of the train station.[46] One bullet remained lodged in his body, but doctors could not find it.[47] Young Jim Garfield and James Blaine both broke down and wept. Robert Todd Lincoln, deeply upset and thinking back to the death of his father, said \\"How many hours of sorrow I have passed in this town.\\"[47]\\r\\nGarfield was carried back to the White House. Although doctors told him that he would not survive the night, the President remained conscious and alert.[48] The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery.[49] A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881.[50][51] His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.[52]\\r\\nGarfield had been a regular visitor to the shore town of Long Branch, NJ, one of the nations premier summer vacation spots until World War I. In early September, it was decided to bring him to Elberon, a quiet beach town just to the south of Long Branch, in hopes that the beach air would help him recover. When they heard that the president was being brought to their town, local citizens built more than half a mile of tracks in less than 24 hours, enabling Garfield to be brought directly to the door of the oceanfront Franklyn cottage, rather than being moved by carriage from the local Elberon train station. However, Garfield died 12 days later. A granite marker on Garfield Rd identifies the former site of the cottage, which was demolished in 1950.\\r\\nChester Arthur was at his home in New York City on the night of September 19, when word came that Garfield had died. After first getting the news, Arthur said \\"I hopemy God, I do hope it is a mistake.\\" But confirmation by telegram came soon after. Arthur took the presidential oath of office, administered by a New York Supreme Court judge, then left for Long Branch to pay his respects before going on to Washington.[53] Garfield's body was taken to Washington, where it lay in state for two days in the Capitol Rotunda before being taken to Cleveland, where the funeral was held on September 26.[54]\\r\\nWhen the tracks that had been hastily built to the Franklyn cottage were later torn up, actor Oliver Byron bought the wooden ties, and had local carpenter William Presley build them into a small tea house, in commemoration of the president. The red & white (originally red, white & blue) \\"Garfield Tea House\\" still survives, resting a couple of blocks away from the site of the cottage on the grounds of the Long Branch Historical Museum, a former Episcopal Church. The church is nicknamed \\"The Church of the Presidents\\", as it had been attended by, in addition to Garfield, Presidents Chester A. Arthur, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, Rutherford Hayes, William McKinley, and Woodrow Wilson, during their own visits to Long Branch.\\r\\nWilliam McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. McKinley was shaking hands with the public when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died eight days later on September 14 from gangrene caused by the bullet wounds.[8]\\r\\nMcKinley had been elected for a second term in 1900.[55] He enjoyed meeting the public, and was reluctant to accept the security available to his office.[56] The Secretary to the President, George B. Cortelyou, feared an assassination attempt would take place during a visit to the Temple of Music, and twice took it off the schedule. McKinley restored it each time.[57]\\r\\nCzolgosz had lost his job during the economic Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy whose adherents had killed foreign leaders.[58] Regarding McKinley as a symbol of oppression, Czolgosz felt it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him.[59] Unable to get near McKinley during the earlier part of the presidential visit, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to shake his hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.[8]\\r\\nMcKinley initially appeared to be recovering, but took a turn for the worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him to convey the bad news.[60] After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.[61]\\r\\nWarren G. Harding died from a sudden heart attack in his hotel suite while visiting San Francisco at around 7:35?p.m. on August 2, 1923. His death quickly led to theories that he had been poisoned[62] or committed suicide. Rumors of poisoning were fueled, in part, by a book called The Strange Death of President Harding, in which the author (convicted criminal, former Ohio Gang member, and detective Gaston Means, hired by Mrs. Harding to investigate Warren Harding and his mistress) suggested that Mrs. Harding had poisoned her husband after learning of his infidelity. Mrs. Harding's refusal to allow an autopsy on President Harding only added to the speculation. According to the physicians attending Harding, however, the symptoms in the days prior to his death all pointed to congestive heart failure. Harding's biographer, Samuel H. Adams, concluded that \\"Warren G. Harding died a natural death which, in any case, could not have been long postponed\\".[63]\\r\\nImmediately after President Harding's death, Mrs. Harding returned to Washington, D.C., and briefly stayed in the White House with the new President Calvin Coolidge and First Lady. For a month, former First Lady Harding gathered and destroyed by fire President Harding's correspondence and documents, both official and unofficial. Upon her return to Marion, Mrs. Harding hired a number of secretaries to collect and burn President Harding's personal papers. According to Mrs. Harding, she took these actions to protect her husband's legacy. The remaining papers were held and kept from public view by the Harding Memorial Association in Marion.[64]\\r\\nOn March 29, 1945, Franklin D. Roosevelt went to the Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations. On the afternoon of April 12, Roosevelt said, \\"I have a terrific pain in the back of my head.\\" He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Dr. Howard Bruenn, diagnosed a massive cerebral hemorrhage (stroke).[65] At 3:35?pm that day, Roosevelt died without regaining consciousness. As Allen Drury later said, so ended an era, and so began another. After Roosevelt's death, an editorial by The New York Times declared, \\"Men will thank God on their knees a hundred years from now that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House\\".[66]\\r\\nIn his later years at the White House, when Roosevelt was increasingly overworked, his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also arranged for her father to meet with his former mistress, the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. A close friend of both Roosevelt and Mercer who was present, Elizabeth Shoumatoff, rushed Mercer away to avoid negative publicity and implications of infidelity. When Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Mercer and that Mercer had been with Franklin when he died.[67]\\r\\nOn the morning of April 13, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported back to Hyde Park by train, guarded by four servicemen, one each from the Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard. As was his wish, Roosevelt was buried in the Rose Garden of the Springwood estate, the Roosevelt family home in Hyde Park on April 15. Eleanor died in November 1962 and was buried next to him.[68]\\r\\nRoosevelt's death was met with shock and grief[69] across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public. Roosevelt had been president for more than 12 years, longer than any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and within sight of the defeat of Japan as well.\\r\\nLess than a month after his death, on May 8, the war in Europe ended. President Harry S. Truman, who turned 61 that day, dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory, and kept the flags across the U.S. at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. In doing so, Truman said that his only wish was \\"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day.\\"[70]\\r\\nJohn F. Kennedy was assassinated at 12:30?p.m. Central Standard Time (18:30 UTC) on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas.[71][72] Kennedy was fatally shot while traveling with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and the latter's wife Nellie, in a Presidential motorcade. The ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963ÿ1964 concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a plot or cover-up.[73][74]\\r\\nMost current John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories put forth a criminal conspiracy involving parties as varied as the CIA, the Mafia, anti-Castro Cuban exile groups, the military industrial complex, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban President Fidel Castro, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, the KGB, or some combination of those entities.[75] In an article published prior to the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, author Vincent Bugliosi estimates that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people have been accused in conspiracy theories challenging the \\"lone gunman\\" theory.[76]","input":"Who was the first president killed in office?"},{"output":"3 September 1939","context":"The Declaration of war by France and the United Kingdom was given on 3 September 1939, after German forces invaded Poland.

Yet I cannot believe that there is anything more or anything different that I could have done and that would have been more successful.\\r\\nUp to the very last it would have been quite possible to have arranged a peaceful and honourable settlement between Germany and Poland, but Hitler would not have it.\\r\\nHe had evidently made up his mind to attack Poland whatever happened; and although he now says he put forward reasonable proposals which were rejected by the Poles, that is not a true statement.\\r\\nThe proposals were never shown to the Poles nor to us; and though they were announced in a German broadcast on Thursday night, Hitler did not wait to hear comments on them, but ordered his troops to cross the Polish frontier the next morning.\\r\\nHis action shows convincingly that there is no chance of expecting that this man will ever give up his practice of using force to gain his will. He can only be stopped by force, and we and France are today, in fulfilment of our obligations, going to the aid of Poland, who is so bravely resisting this wicked and unprovoked attack upon her people. We have a clear conscience. We have done all that any country could do to establish peace. The situation in which no word given by Germanys ruler could be trusted and no people or country could feel itself safe has become intolerable.\\r\\nAnd now that we have resolved to finish it, I know that you will all play your part with calmness and courage.\\r\\nAt such a moment as this the assurances of support that we have received from the Empire are a source of profound encouragement to us.\\r\\nWhen I have finished speaking certain detailed announcements will be made on behalf of the Government.

It is the evil things that we shall be fighting against ÿ brute force, bad faith, injustice, oppression and persecution ÿ and against them I am certain that the right will prevail.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of the First World War, the German Empire signed the First Armistice at Compigne on 11 November 1918 as an end to hostilities with France, the British Empire, and the United States during the convoluted German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, which began 29 October 1918.\\r\\nNegotiations between the Allied powers regarding post-war Europe started on 18 January 1919 in the Salle de l'Horloge at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Seventy delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. The opposing nations of the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations. At first a \\"Council of Ten\\" comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan met officially to decide the peace terms. It became the \\"Big Four\\" when Japan dropped out and the top person from each of the other four nations met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions to be ratified by the entire assembly. In June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within 24 hours. On 23 June 1919, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty.\\r\\nOn 28 June 1919, Germany signed the Treaty of Versailles, a peace treaty which ended the formal state of war and imposed various punitive measures upon Germany, including military restriction, loss of territory and colonies, war debt, and effective acceptance of blame for the initiation of hostilities in World War I. At the time of the armistice, an attempted Communist revolution transpired (October 1918-August 1919), resulting in the abdication of the Emperor of Germany in November 1918, and what became known as the Weimar Republic was subsequently established in the wake of the uprising. The transition from monarchy to republic was difficult, and many in the new government were not supportive of the democratic system of government. The officer class gave little support to the Republic, and Germany was forced to borrow money from the United States and others to pay its war debt, imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. In the early 1920s a period of hyperinflation made the Reichsmark almost worthless. In January 1922, one US dollar was worth 191 Marks, but by November of the same year it was equal to 4,200,000,000 Marks.[2]\\r\\nIn 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich following a contentious election. Under Hitler's leadership, the Reichstag turned the government into an effective dictatorship under Hitler's oversight on 21 March 1933 with the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and the economic hardships were significantly diminished via implementation of new economic and social policies. After five years in power, Hitler annexed Austria, former component of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (allies of the former German Empire), into Germany, despite such an act (specifically, \\"prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations\\") being banned by both the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Versailles. In early November 1938, the First Vienna Award was signed, allowing Germany to seize the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia which had been a part of the German Empire-allied Austro-Hungarian Empire. Soon after, Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia and also gained Memelland (part of the former German Empire from 1871-1920) through the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania.\\r\\nWhile some sources claim Hitler still wanted more, to create Lebensraum, or \\"living space\\", for Germany, other sources claim evidence of hostility on behalf of Polish partisans toward ethnic Germans in the Danzig Corridor (territory lost to Germany as a result of the Treaty of Versailles) which may have served as a motivating factor for the German invasion (often portrayed as propaganda to justify German expansionism).\\r\\nTwo Western powers, the United Kingdom and France, gave guarantees to Poland that they would declare war if Polish independence came under threat, as presented in a statement to the House of Commons by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 31 March 1939 (formalized by the British 6 April 1939; not ratified until 4 September 1939 by the French):\\r\\n... in the event of any action which clearly threatened Polish independence, and which the Polish Government accordingly considered it vital to resist with their national forces, His Majesty's Government would feel themselves bound at once to lend the Polish Government all support in their power. They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.\\r\\nI may add that the French Government have authorised me to make it plain that they stand in the same position in this matter as do His Majesty's Government.[3]\\r\\nAlthough they honoured these guarantees by declaring war soon after Germany's Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939,[4] and although the dominions of the British Empire quickly followed suit, so little practical assistance was given to Poland, which was soon defeated, that in its early stages the war declared by Britain and France was described as a \\"Phoney War\\".\\r\\nFurther, neither the British Empire, nor the French, ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, which invaded Poland on 17 September 1939 (17 days after Nazi Germany invaded from the West) and held sway over the former-Polish territory at the war's conclusion, having become a part of the Allied front in the course of World War II. At the insistence of Joseph Stalin, the post-war Yalta Conference in 1945 sanctioned the formation of a new provisional pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the Polish government-in-exile based in London.\\r\\nThe following excerpts of the speech were sampled by the drum and bass artist S.P.Y. in his remix of Black Sun Empire's track \\"Potemkin\\":[5]\\r\\n- \\"that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us\\"\\r\\n- \\"I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany\\",","input":"When did france and britain declare war on germany ww2?"},{"output":"from the original chemical name, hyposulphite of soda","context":"Sodium thiosulfate (sodium thiosulphate) is a chemical and medication. As a medication it is used to treat cyanide poisoning and pityriasis versicolor.[2]\\r\\nIt is an inorganic compound with the formula Na2S2O3.xH2O. Typically it is available as the white or colorless pentahydrate, Na2S2O3{5H2O. The solid is an efflorescent (loses water readily) crystalline substance that dissolves well in water. It is also called sodium hyposulfite or hypo.[3]\\r\\nIt is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn analytical chemistry, the most important use comes because the thiosulfate anion reacts stoichiometrically with iodine in aqueous solution, reducing it to iodide as it is oxidized to tetrathionate:\\r\\nDue to the quantitative nature of this reaction, as well as because Na2S2O3{5H2O has an excellent shelf-life, it is used as a titrant in iodometry. Na2S2O3{5H2O is also a component of iodine clock experiments.\\r\\nThis particular use can be set up to measure the oxygen content of water through a long series of reactions in the Winkler test for dissolved oxygen. It is also used in estimating volumetrically the concentrations of certain compounds in solution (hydrogen peroxide, for instance) and in estimating the chlorine content in commercial bleaching powder and water.\\r\\nSilver halides, e.g., AgBr, typical components of photographic emulsions, dissolve upon treatment with aqueous thiosulfate:\\r\\nThis application as a photographic fixer was discovered by John Herschel. It is used for both film and photographic paper processing; the sodium thiosulfate is known as a photographic fixer, and is often referred to as 'hypo', from the original chemical name, hyposulphite of soda.[12]\\r\\nSodium thiosulfate is a component of an alternative lixiviant to cyanide for extraction of gold.[13] However, it forms a strong soluble complex with gold(I) ions, [Au(S2O3)2]3?. The advantage of this approach is that thiosulfate is essentially not toxic and that ore types that are refractory to gold cyanidation (e.g. carbonaceous or Carlin-type ores) can be leached by thiosulfate. Some problems with this alternative process include the high consumption of thiosulfate, and the lack of a suitable recovery technique, since [Au(S2O3)2]3? does not adsorb to activated carbon, which is the standard technique used in gold cyanidation to separate the gold complex from the ore slurry.\\r\\nIt is used to dechlorinate tap water including lowering chlorine levels for use in aquaria and swimming pools and spas (e.g., following superchlorination) and within water treatment plants to treat settled backwash water prior to release into rivers.[3] The reduction reaction is analogous to the iodine reduction reaction.\\r\\nIn pH testing of bleach substances, sodium thiosulfate neutralizes the color-removing effects of bleach and allows one to test the pH of bleach solutions with liquid indicators. The relevant reaction is akin to the iodine reaction: thiosulfate reduces the hypochlorite (active ingredient in bleach) and in so doing becomes oxidized to sulfate. The complete reaction is:\\r\\nSimilarly, sodium thiosulfate reacts with bromine, removing the free bromine from solution. Solutions of sodium thiosulfate are commonly used as a precaution in chemistry laboratories when working with bromine and for the safe disposal of bromine, iodine, or other strong oxidizers.\\r\\nSodium thiosulfate is also used:\\r\\nTwo polymorphs are known of the pentahydrate. The anhydrous salt exists in several polymorphs.[3] In the solid state, the thiosulfate anion is tetrahedral in shape and is notionally derived by replacing one of the oxygen atoms by a sulfur atom in a sulfate anion. The S-S distance indicates a single bond, implying that the terminal sulfur bears significant negative charge and the S-O interactions have more double-bond character.\\r\\nOn an industrial scale, sodium thiosulfate is produced chiefly from liquid waste products of sodium sulfide or sulfur dye manufacture.[16]\\r\\nIn the laboratory, this salt can be prepared by heating an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite with sulfur or by boiling aqueous sodium hydroxide and sulfur according to this equation:[17]\\r\\nUpon heating to 300?C, it decomposes to sodium sulfate and sodium polysulfide:\\r\\nThiosulfate salts characteristically decompose upon treatment with acids. Initial protonation occurs at sulfur. When the protonation is conducted in diethyl ether at ?78?C, H2S2O3 (thiosulfuric acid) can be obtained. It is a somewhat strong acid with pKas of 0.6 and 1.7 for the first and second dissociations, respectively.\\r\\nUnder normal conditions, acidification of solutions of this salt excess with even dilute acids results in complete decomposition to sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and water:[16]\\r\\nThis reaction is known as a \\"clock reaction\\", because when the sulfur reaches a certain concentration, the solution turns from colourless to a pale yellow. This reaction has been employed to generate colloidal sulfur. This process is used to demonstrate the concept of reaction rate in chemistry classes.\\r\\nSodium thiosulfate is also used in analytical chemistry.[citation needed] It can, when heated with a sample containing aluminium cations, produce a white precipitate:\\r\\nAlkylation of sodium thiosulfate gives S-alkylthiosulfates, which are called Bunte salts.

It is often referred to as the Afghan Persian.[2][3] Both Pashto and Persian are Indo-European languages from the Iranian languages sub-family. Other regional languages, such as Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi and Nuristani are spoken by minority groups across the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nMinor languages may include Hindi-Urdu,[4][5] Punjabi,[6] Ashkunu, Kamkata-viri, Vasi-vari, Tregami and Kalasha-ala, Pamiri (Shughni, Munji, Ishkashimi and Wakhi), Brahui, Qizilbash, Aimaq, and Pashai and Kyrgyz. Linguist Harald Haarmann believes that Afghanistan is home to more than 40 minor languages,[7] with around 200 different dialects.\\r\\n\\r\\nDari is the most spoken language of Afghanistan's official languages[1] and acts as a lingua franca for the country. In 1980, other regional languages were granted official status in the regions where they are the language of the majority.[8] Article 16 of the 2004 Afghan Constitution states that Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi, Nuristani and Pamiri are ÿ in addition to Pashto and Dari ÿ the third official language in areas where the majority speaks them. The practical modalities for implementation of this provision shall be specified by law.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDari is a term long recommended by Afghan authorities to designate the Persian dialects spoken in Afghanistan, in contrast to the dialects spoken in neighboring Iran.[9] Although still widely known as \\"Farsi\\" (\\"Persian\\") to its native speakers, the name was officially changed to Dari in 1964.[10] Dari must not be confused with the dialect of Kabul, which is the dominant Persian dialect in Afghanistan. Apart from a few basics of vocabulary, however (and more Indo-Persian calligraphic styles in the Perso-Arabic script), there is little difference between formal written Persian of Afghanistan and of Iran. The term Dari is often loosely used for the characteristic spoken Persian of Afghanistan ÿ in general the dialect of Kabul ÿ but is best restricted to formal spoken registers (poetry, speeches, newscasts, and other broadcast announcements).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDari functions as the nation's lingua franca and is the native tongue of various Afghan ethnic groups including the Tajiks, Hazaras, and Aimak.[12] Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan.[13] Due to Afghanistan's multi-ethnic character, language variety as well as bilingualism and multilingualism are common phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact figures about the size and composition of the various ethnolinguistic groups are unavailable since no systematic census has been held in Afghanistan in decades.[15] Estimates suggest the following primary languages:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a 2006 opinion poll survey involving 6,226 randomly selected Afghan citizens by the Asia Foundation, Dari was the first language of 49%, with an additional 37% stating the ability to speak Dari as a second language; 42% were able to read Dari. Second, Pashto was the first language of 40% of the polled people, while an additional 28% spoke it as a second language; 33% were able to read Pashto. Uzbek was the first language of 9% and a second language for 6%. Turkmen was the first language of 2% and a second language for 3%. English was spoken by 8% and Urdu by 7%.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nA later study found that Dari was, by a wide margin, the most widely spoken language in urban Afghanistan, with as many as 93% of Afghans claiming to speak it, but only 75% of rural Afghans claiming the same.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sizeable population in Afghanistan, especially in Kabul, can also speak and understand Hindi-Urdu due to the popularity and influence of Bollywood films and songs in the region.[4][5]","input":"What is the most common language spoken in afghanistan?"},{"output":"variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks","context":"In geology, the crust is the outermost solid shell of a rocky planet, dwarf planet or natural satellite, which is chemically distinct from the underlying mantle. The crusts of Earth, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Io, and other planetary bodies have been generated largely by igneous processes, and these crusts are richer in incompatible elements than their respective mantles. The Earth's crust is composed of distinctly different continental crust and oceanic crust, which have different chemical compositions and physical properties, and which were formed by different geological processes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is composed of a great variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The crust is underlain by the mantle. The upper part of the mantle is composed mostly of peridotite, a rock denser than rocks common in the overlying crust. The boundary between the crust and mantle is conventionally placed at the Mohorovi?i? discontinuity, a boundary defined by a contrast in seismic velocity. The crust occupies less than 1% of Earth's volume.[1]\\r\\nThe crust of the Earth is of two distinctive types: oceanic and continental. The oceanic crust is 5?km (3?mi) to 10?km (6?mi) thick[2] and is composed primarily of basalt, diabase, and gabbro. The continental crust is typically from 30?km (20?mi) to 50?km (30?mi) thick and is mostly composed of slightly less dense rocks than those of the oceanic crust. Some of these less dense rocks, such as granite, are common in the continental crust but rare to absent in the oceanic crust.\\r\\nBoth the continental and oceanic crust \\"float\\" on the mantle. Because the continental crust is thicker, it extends both to greater elevations and greater depth than the oceanic crust. The slightly lower density of felsic continental rock compared to basaltic oceanic rock contributes to the higher relative elevation of the top of the continental crust. As the top of the continental crust reaches elevations higher than that of the oceanic, water runs off the continents and collects above the oceanic crust. Because of the change in velocity of seismic waves it is believed that beneath continents at a certain depth continental crust (sial) becomes close in its physical properties to oceanic crust (sima), and the transition zone is referred to as the Conrad discontinuity.\\r\\nThe temperature of the crust increases with depth,[3] reaching values typically in the range from about 200?C (392?F) to 400?C (752?F) at the boundary with the underlying mantle. The crust and underlying relatively rigid uppermost mantle make up the lithosphere. Because of convection in the underlying plastic (although non-molten) upper mantle and asthenosphere, the lithosphere is broken into tectonic plates that move. The temperature increases by as much as 30?C (54?F) for every kilometer locally in the upper part of the crust, but the geothermal gradient is smaller in deeper crust.[4]\\r\\nPartly by analogy to what is known about the Moon, Earth is considered to have differentiated from an aggregate of planetesimals into its core, mantle and crust within about 100 million years of the formation of the planet, 4.6 billion years ago. During the Hadean, the primordial crust was very thin and was probably destroyed by much more vigorous plate tectonics, volcanic activity and significant asteroid impacts,[5] which were much more common in the early stages of the solar system.\\r\\nEarth has probably always had some form of basaltic crust, but the age of the oldest oceanic crust today is only about 200? million years. In contrast, the bulk of the continental crust is much older. The oldest continental crustal rocks on Earth have ages in the range from about 3.7 to 4.28? billion years [6][7] and have been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane in Western Australia, in the Acasta Gneiss in the Northwest Territories on the Canadian Shield, and on other cratonic regions such as those on the Fennoscandian Shield. Some zircon with age as great as 4.3 billion years has been found in the Narryer Gneiss Terrane.\\r\\nThe average age of the current Earth's continental crust has been estimated to be about 2.0?billion years.[8] Most crustal rocks formed before 2.5 billion years ago are located in cratons. Such old continental crust and the underlying mantle asthenosphere are less dense than elsewhere in Earth and so are not readily destroyed by subduction. Formation of new continental crust is linked to periods of intense orogeny; these periods coincide with the formation of the supercontinents such as Rodinia, Pangaea and Gondwana. The crust forms in part by aggregation of island arcs including granite and metamorphic fold belts, and it is preserved in part by depletion of the underlying mantle to form buoyant lithospheric mantle.\\r\\nThe continental crust has an average composition similar to that of andesite.[9] The most abundant minerals in Earth's continental crust are feldspars, which make up about 41% of the crust by weight, followed by quartz at 12%, and pyroxenes at 11%.[10] Continental crust is enriched in incompatible elements compared to the basaltic ocean crust and much enriched compared to the underlying mantle. Although the continental crust comprises only about 0.6 weight percent of the silicate on Earth, it contains 20% to 70% of the incompatible elements.\\r\\nAll the other constituents except water occur only in very small quantities and total less than 1%. Estimates of average density for the upper crust range between 2.69 and 2.74 g/cm3 and for lower crust between 3.0 and 3.25 g/cm3.[11]\\r\\nA theoretical protoplanet named \\"Theia\\" is thought to have collided with the forming Earth, and part of the material ejected into space by the collision accreted to form the Moon. As the Moon formed, the outer part of it is thought to have been molten, a lunar magma ocean. Plagioclase feldspar crystallized in large amounts from this magma ocean and floated toward the surface. The cumulate rocks form much of the crust. The upper part of the crust probably averages about 88% plagioclase (near the lower limit of 90% defined for anorthosite): the lower part of the crust may contain a higher percentage of ferromagnesian minerals such as the pyroxenes and olivine, but even that lower part probably averages about 78% plagioclase.[12] The underlying mantle is denser and olivine-rich.\\r\\nThe thickness of the crust ranges between about 20 and 120?km. Crust on the far side of the Moon averages about 12?km thicker than that on the near side. Estimates of average thickness fall in the range from about 50 to 60?km. Most of this plagioclase-rich crust formed shortly after formation of the moon, between about 4.5 and 4.3 billion years ago. Perhaps 10% or less of the crust consists of igneous rock added after the formation of the initial plagioclase-rich material. The best-characterized and most voluminous of these later additions are the mare basalts formed between about 3.9 and 3.2 billion years ago. Minor volcanism continued after 3.2 billion years, perhaps as recently as 1 billion years ago. There is no evidence of plate tectonics.\\r\\nStudy of the Moon has established that a crust can form on a rocky planetary body significantly smaller than Earth. Although the radius of the Moon is only about a quarter that of Earth, the lunar crust has a significantly greater average thickness. This thick crust formed almost immediately after formation of the Moon. Magmatism continued after the period of intense meteorite impacts ended about 3.9 billion years ago, but igneous rocks younger than 3.9 billion years make up only a minor part of the crust.[13]","input":"What is found in the earth's crust?"},{"output":"54 feet high and 124 feet wide","context":"Minute Maid Park, previously known as The Ballpark at Union Station, Enron Field, and Astros Field, is a ballpark in Downtown Houston, Texas, United States, that opened in 2000 to house the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). The ballpark is Houston's first retractable-roofed stadium, and features a natural grass playing field. The ballpark was built as a replacement of the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium ever built, which opened in 1965. It is named for beverage brand Minute Maid, a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, which acquired naming rights in 2002 for $100 million over 30 years. As of 2016, Minute Maid Park has a seating capacity of 41,168, which includes 5,197 club seats and 63 luxury suites.\\r\\nThe largest entrance to the park is inside what was once Houston's Union Station, and the left-field side of the stadium features a railway as homage to the site's history. The train moves along an 800-foot (240?m) length of track on top of the length of the exterior wall beyond left field when the Astros take the field during the first inning, when an Astros player hits a home run, and when the Astros win a game.[16] The engine's tender is filled with giant oranges in reference to Minute Maid's most famous product, orange juice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1909, during the time when West End Park was Houston's premier ballpark, the Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company commissioned the design of a new union station for the city from New York City-based architects Warren and Wetmore. The location called for the demolition of several structures of Houston prominence. Horace Baldwin Rice's residence and Adath Yeshurun Congregation's synagogue among other structures were removed.[17]\\r\\nWith an original estimated cost of $1 million USD, Union Station was constructed by the American Construction Company for an eventual total of five times that amount.[18] Exterior walls were constructed of granite, limestone, and terracotta, while the interior used an extensive amount of marble. It was completed and opened on March 1, 1911. At the time, Houston, with seventeen railways, was considered the main railroad hub of the Southern United States.[19] This is also evident by the Seal of Houston, which prominently features a locomotive. Two more floors were added the following year.[20]\\r\\nThe station served as the main inter-city passenger terminal for Houston for over seven decades thereafter. Passenger rail declined greatly after World War II, and the last regularly-scheduled train, the Lone Star, moved its service to Houston's current Amtrak station on July 31, 1974. With this move, the building effectively became abandoned. On November 10, 1977, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places by the National Park Service.\\r\\nIn August 1995, Astros owner Drayton McLane, then leasing the Astrodome from Harris County, commented to the Houston Chronicle that he was not in the market for a new ballpark. In reference to Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, McLane noted, \\"[...] I remember when those were built in the 1970s and those were as good a stadiums as there were. They were the most modern stadiums in the world, and now they're saying they're all bad. That they can't make a go of it without a new stadium. It helps, but there are other things involved.\\"[21]\\r\\nLater that year, Houston's NFL franchise and joint-tenant of the Astrodome, the Houston Oilers, announced that they were leaving to Nashville, Tennessee in order to have a new stadium built for the team there. Citing a lack of adequate luxury boxes, in October, Astros Vice-President Bob McClaren claimed that renovations to the Astrodome would help increase revenue.[22] Drayton McLane pointed toward Astrodome renovations as necessary saying \\"It's 30 years old and not a lot of money has been spent to remodel it.\\"[23] According to the organization, the team was in danger of being sold to a Virginia businessman who was expected to move the Astros to Washington D.C. because of poor revenue.\\r\\nIn June 1996, University of Houston alumnus, BMC Software and San Diego Padres owner, John J. Moores, who wanted to own the next NFL franchise in Houston, met with Texas State Senator Mario Gallegos, Jr., and other local Hispanic leaders in regards to the future of a football-only Astrodome and a new baseball-only ballpark in Downtown Houston.[24] Meanwhile, Harris County Judge Robert Eckels pieced together a plan to build a new ballpark next to the Astrodome in the Astrodomain. The Astros echoed the Astrodomain location sentiment because they believed construction time would be shorter.[25] Eckels, who convinced then Mayor Bob Lanier of the lack of viability for the ballpark in a downtown location, was quoted as saying, \\"They keep telling me about these miracles in other cities, but it doesn't work in Houston [...] If we are going to put this stadium some place, let's stick with a proven place.\\"[26] This plan was considered to be nearly finalized when the Astros and Harris County agreed to a $250 million USD county-funded stadium whose overrun costs would be funded by the Astros.[27]\\r\\nIn August 1996, Houston's Union Station received a $2 million USD grant from the Texas Transportation Commission for renovation in a separate project.[28] Plans for the new ballpark's location drastically changed by September mostly in response to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay's input and pledge to substantially contribute to funding if placed downtown.[29] It was at this time that the Union Station location was proposed by Lay. Upon an agreement between all of the leadership entities, the idea of a retractable roof stadium was confirmed for the new ballpark. A November referendum was planned for Harris County residents to approve the deal.\\r\\nThe Harris County referendum that took place on November 5, 1996, to help fund the ballpark passed by a narrow margin of 51% to 49%.[30] In response to the referendum, during the 75th Texas Legislature Texas State Senator John Whitmire of Houston sponsored a bill supported by five of the six area Harris County senators that would create the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority.[31] With companion House Bill 92 authored by Houston-born Representative Kim Brimer voted upon and adopted by both chambers, the authorization for creation of a sports authority was approved.[32] It was signed into law by Governor George W. Bush on June 2, 1997.[33] The Harris County-Houston Sports Authority would assist in financing for the new ballpark as well as allow for renovation of the Astrodome by allowing for special county-wide taxation of rental cars, tickets, parking, and hotel use.\\r\\nIn June 1997, with the ability to create a sports authority signed into law, concurrent votes of the Harris County Commissioners' Court and the Houston City Council to establish the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority on effective September 1, 1997.[34] Its chairman and twelve other directors were jointly appointed by the Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge. The institution remains in existence today.\\r\\nThe ballpark was named \\"Enron Field\\" after a $100 million, 30-year naming rights deal was made with Enron on April 7, 1999.[35]\\r\\nEarly stadium sketches from Kansas City-based Populous (then HOK Sport) using the working title \\"The Ballpark at Union Station\\" were released to the public on October 11, 1996, where Astros President Tal Smith was open about his suggestions for the stadium including the location of the flagpole in center field and a traditional dirt path from the pitcher's mound to home plate.[36][37] While the dirt path was not implemented, the flagpole idea became known as \\"Tal's Hill\\" and remained a signature feature of the ballpark until 2016.\\r\\nUnion Station's main concourse was preserved and renovated as the ballpark's main lobby.\\r\\nIn late 1997, it was announced that local Brown & Root would manage construction of the stadium, while Populous with Walter P. Moore would design it.[38] The electrification of Minute Maid Park's retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.[39]\\r\\nGround broke for The Ballpark at Union Station on October 30, 1997.[40] Its groundbreaking ceremony was attended by Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, Astros owner Drayton McLane, Harris County Judge Robert Eckles, Harris County Commissioner El Franco Lee, and Harris County-Houston Sports Authority Chairman Jack Rains.\\r\\nStatues of longtime Astros players Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio are located in the exterior of the ballpark in a space known as The Plaza at Minute Maid Park. The two former teammates are depicted playing baseball with each other. The plaza also displays pennants for all Astros division and league championships as well as several plaques to commemorate notable Astros and their achievements.\\r\\nThe ballpark was first christened \\"Enron Field\\" on April 7, 2000, with naming rights sold to the Houston energy and financial trading company in a 30-year, $100 million deal. However, Astros management faced a public relations problem when the energy corporation went bankrupt in 2001 due to a financial scandal. Quickly wanting to distance themselves from Enron, Astros ownership asked to prematurely end naming rights, but Enron refused.[41] On February 5, 2002, Astros ownership filed a motion with the court overseeing the company's bankruptcy to force Enron to make an immediate decision on the matter. By February 27, the two entities agreed to end the naming rights, and settled with the Astros paying $2.1 million to Enron. Without a naming rights agreement in place, the ballpark became officially known as \\"Astros Field\\".[42]\\r\\nIn June 2002, it was announced that the Astros had sold naming rights of the ballpark to locally based Coca-Cola subsidiary Minute Maid for $100 million over 30 years.[43] Its official name was then changed to \\"Minute Maid Park\\".\\r\\nDuring its days as Enron Field, it was also dubbed \\"Ten-Run\\" or \\"Home Run\\" Field due to its cozy left-field dimensions. In keeping with this theme while paying homage to its current sponsor, the nickname \\"The Juice Box\\" is colloquially used today.[44] The dubbing of the park as an extreme hitter-friendly park has been called into question in recent years. The 2009 season saw the park ranked 24th out of 30 Major League parks in terms of runs scored in the park and ten other ballparks saw more home runs hit.[45] The long center-field and left-center-field dimensions (before the 2016-17 renovations) neutralized the park, and Minute Maid's batting park factor is consistently very near average. However, in 2014, it was ranked the 12th-most batter-friendly ballpark.[46]\\r\\nIn 2004, the Astros launched Wi-Fi throughout the ballpark, allowing fans to use the Internet while attending a game for a fee.[47] In addition, the ballpark was the first major sports facility to use a separate video board exclusively for closed captioning for the hearing impaired of PA system and video board content, rather than appearing along the bottom of the main board.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Chick-fil-A cows were unveiled on the foul poles, saying EAT MOR FOWL, and the cows have Astros caps on. If an Astros player hits the pole, all fans in attendance get a coupon for a free chicken sandwich from Chick-fil-A. Hunter Pence is the first and second Astro to hit the left field \\"Fowl Pole\\" when he did it twice in the 2007 season. Ty Wigginton became the third Astro to hit the left field pole on September 16, 2007. Kazuo Matsui hit the right field foul pole on August 3, 2009, with a two-run homer in the sixth inning to beat the Giants. Carlos Lee hit the left field pole on July 28, 2010, giving the Astros an 8ÿ1 win against the Cubs. Two days later, Jeff Keppinger hit the left field pole to help the Astros win, 5ÿ0, against the Brewers.\\r\\nAfter the 2008 season, the Astros' groundskeepers began installing 2.3 acres (9,300?m2) of a new turfgrass playing surface at Minute Maid Park.[48] The Astros also became one of the first to use the new Chemgrass, later known as AstroTurf after its first well-publicized use at the Houston Astrodome in 1966.\\r\\nIn honor of longtime Astros broadcaster Milo Hamilton, the City of Houston officially renamed a portion of the Ballpark District to the \\"Hall of Fame District\\", and the portion of Hamilton Avenue that runs within that district to \\"Milo Hamilton Way\\" on April 8, 2009.[49]\\r\\nFor the 2011 season, the park added a large Daktronics HD screen nicknamed \\"El Grande\\" replacing the original one in center field. At 54 feet high and 124 feet wide, it is the fourth largest scoreboard in Major League Baseball, behind Safeco Field (home of the Seattle Mariners), Progressive Field (home of the Cleveland Indians), and Kaufmann Stadium (home of the Kansas City Royals). The old screen was taken out and replaced by billboards. Additionally, a smaller HD screen was added on the far left field wall. The ring of advertisement screens around the park were replaced in favor of HD ribbon boards.[7]\\r\\nAfter the Astros reverted to their original colors and logo in 2013, much of Minute Maid Park was repainted to navy and orange from brick red. Signs with the previous logo and colors were also replaced.[50] More than 4,500 US gallons (17,000?l) of paint were used and over 1,000 signs were replaced.\\r\\nIn June 2015 the Astros announced that Tal's Hill would be removed in a major renovation project during the 2015-2016 offseason, to be replaced with additional seating, concessions, and escalators for fans.[51] This would result in center field dimensions of 436 feet (then the longest in MLB) being reduced to 409 feet. In addition, seating sections 256, 257, and 258 in the outfield mezzanine would be removed. However, the project had to be postponed due to the Astros' unexpected American League Wild Card championship and subsequent postseason appearance, along with the stadium's offseason event schedule.[52] The renovation was completed during the 2016-2017 offseason.[53]\\r\\nWhile primarily a baseball venue, Minute Maid Park can adequately host sports such as soccer and both codes of rugby. The venue can also play host to large-scale music concerts. It is not large enough to comfortably accommodate American football.\\r\\nIts debut as a soccer venue happened during the 2006 edition of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The stadium hosted the first leg of the quarterfinal between Portmore United of Jamaica (the \\"home\\" team) and Club Amrica of Mexico.[59]\\r\\nPaul McCartney, Jay Z, Beyonc, Taylor Swift, Nelly, Tim McGraw, Staind and Madonna have all performed at Minute Maid Park.\\r\\nThe nationally syndicated TV talk show Rachael Ray held a mass wedding at the park following Hurricane Ike for 40 couples who were unable to get married after a company they paid to hold the weddings went bankrupt. Comedian Jeffrey Ross served as best man for all 40 couples. The ceremony was aired as part of a special episode of the talk show on November 21, 2008.[62]\\r\\nThe stadium also is the host of the Houston College Classic college baseball tournament, part of the winter fan festival held in February. The tournament features local schools the University of Houston and Rice University every year, a pair of major conference schools, alternating between Big 12 members University of Texas at Austin, Texas Tech University, Baylor University and SEC member Texas A&M University, as well as two other teams from around the country.\\r\\nOn May 9, 2015, Canelo Alvarez fought James Kirkland in the first boxing match fought in the stadium. Alvarez defeated Kirkland via knockout in the third round.\\r\\nThe University of HoustonÿDowntown also holds their commencement ceremony in Minute Maid Park.[63]\\r\\nMinute Maid Park hosted a cricket match on November 11, 2015, the second in a series of three Cricket All-Stars matches played by retired greats of the game.[64] Shane Warne's Warne's Warriors clinched the series 2-0. Keeping with the naming conventions from the previous match at Minute Maid Park, the ends were named after Nolan Ryan and Jos Cruz, two players that have their numbers retired by the Astros.\\r\\nOn January 30, 2017, the stadium was the site of opening festivities for Super Bowl LI, to be held at nearby NRG Stadium. The event included the popular Media Day where players on the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons conducted interviews.[65]\\r\\nIn April 2017, the park hosted the final rounds of the Houston leg of the FIRST Championship. To avoid damaging the field while the Astros were in season, the competition fields were built on a stage over the infield dirt between first and third base.[66]\\r\\nIn dramatic contrast to the Astrodome, the most pitching-oriented stadium in Major League Baseball for most of its existence, Minute Maid Park is known[by whom?] for being particularly hitter-friendly down the lines, especially in left field where it is only 315?ft (96 m) to the Crawford Boxes, though the wall there is 19 feet (5.8 m) tall. In a challenge to home run hitters, former Astros owner Drayton McLane's office window, located in the old Union Station and directly above the Crawford Boxes, is made of glass and a sign below the window is marked 422?ft (135 m) from home plate.\\r\\nIn contrast to the ease of hitting a home run to the Crawford Boxes, it was quite difficult to hit a ball out in center field, as the deep-centre wall was 436?ft (133 m) from home plate and had held the top spot for active MLB ballparks for the deepest center field of any park in baseball.[67] Fielding is a challenge there as well, due to the 90-foot (27?m) wide center field incline called Tal's Hill, for former team president Tal Smith, an element taken from Crosley Field and other historic ballparks, and the flagpole in play, an element taken from Yankee Stadium before its remodeling in the mid-'70s and Tiger Stadium among others. Milwaukee Brewers player Richie Sexson once hit a ball off the flagpole. There was a mark there until the 2011 season, when the pole was repainted. The hill and the flagpole were scheduled to be removed following the 2015 season,[68] but remained in place due to an unexpected playoff run.[69] The hill and flagpole remained in place until the end of the 2016 season.[70]\\r\\nThe visiting team's bullpen is housed entirely in the exterior left field wall, next to the Crawford Boxes, making it one of the few bullpens in Major League ballparks to be completely indoors. Although windows in the outfield fence offer a view into and from the bullpen, its entrance is actually built into the side of the Crawford Boxes.\\r\\nWhile Crosley Field's infamous left field terrace, which was half as steep (only 15) as Tal's Hill (30), was a natural feature of the site on which the park was located, Tal's Hill is purely decorative. Both features have been held in equal disdain by center fielders. This hill has caused some of the most replayed catches in recent baseball history, and plenty of controversy as well. Lance Berkman said, \\"If the ball rolls onto the hill, it's not steep enough to roll back, so you have to go get it. Then there's the chance of running into the flagpole that's on it and getting hurt.\\" Fans started an online petition to remove the hill and flagpole, though the petition has since been discontinued. On June 4, 2015, the Astros announced that they would be removing Tal's Hill as part of a $15 million renovation for the 2016 season. The center field fence was to be moved in from 436 feet (which from 2000 to 2016 was the longest in baseball) to 409 feet (125?m) from home plate, but the center field renovations were delayed until after the 2016 season, due at least in part to the 2015 playoffs cutting into planned construction time.[71]\\r\\nThe ballpark features 19,201 seats on the lower level,[72] 7,132 seats on the second level,[72] 880 seats on the suite level,[72] and 13,750 seats on the upper level.[72]\\r\\nA concourse above Tal's Hill features the \\"Phillips 66 Home Run Porch\\" in left-center field that is over the field of play, and features a classic petrol pump that displays the total number of Astros home runs hit since the park opened.\\r\\nThe stadium can be fully air-conditioned when required.\\r\\nMinute Maid Park is located in Downtown Houston in a centralized area of the city, and accessible via a short driving distance on Interstate 10 (Katy Freeway/East Freeway), Interstate 69 (Southwest Freeway/Eastex Freeway), and Interstate 45 (Gulf Freeway/North Freeway). Street parking, garage parking, and private lot parking are available, with an estimated 25,000 spots within walking distance to the ballpark. Taxi cabs and pedicabs are also commonly found near the surrounding ballpark area.\\r\\nPublic transportation allows for accessibility via bus or light rail service. The METRORail light rail system has a stop located one block south of Minute Maid Park, Convention District Station, served by the Green and Purple lines. The Red Line also serves the ballpark at Preston Station, six blocks to the west.\\r\\nIn 2017, the park was completely flooded on the ground floor as a result of Hurricane Harvey. The playing surface had to be completely rebuilt before the Astros could return from playing their home games in St. Petersburg, Florida.[73]","input":"How big is the screen at minute maid park?"},{"output":"19th century","context":"The petroleum industry is not of recent origin, but petroleum's current status as the key component of politics, society, and technology has its roots in the early 20th century. The invention of the internal combustion engine was the major influence in the rise in the importance of petroleum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFour thousand years ago, according to Herodotus and confirmed by Diodorus Siculus, asphalt was used in the construction of the walls and towers of Babylon; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on Zacynthus (Ionian islands, Greece).[1] Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river Issus[citation needed], one of the tributaries of the Euphrates. Ancient Persian tablets indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society[citation needed].\\r\\nOil was exploited in the Roman province of Dacia, now in Romania, where it was called picula.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe use of petroleum dates back to ancient China more than 2000 years ago. In I Ching, one of the earliest Chinese writings cites the use of oil in its raw state without refining was first discovered, extracted, and used in China in the first century BCE. In addition, the Chinese were the first to use petroleum as fuel as the early as the fourth century BCE.[2][3][4][5]\\r\\nThe earliest known oil wells were drilled in China in 347 AD or earlier. They had depths of up to about 800 feet (240?m) and were drilled using bits attached to bamboo poles.[6][7][8][9][unreliable source?] The oil was burned to evaporate brine and produce salt. By the 10th century, extensive bamboo pipelines connected oil wells with salt springs. The ancient records of China and Japan are said to contain many allusions to the use of natural gas for lighting and heating. Petroleum was known as burning water in Japan in the 7th century.[1] In his book Dream Pool Essays written in 1088, the polymathic scientist and statesman Shen Kuo of the Song Dynasty coined the word fS (Shy܇u, literally \\"rock oil\\") for petroleum, which remains the term used in contemporary Chinese and Japanese (Sekiy).\\r\\nThe first streets of Baghdad were paved with tar, derived from petroleum that became accessible from natural fields in the region. In the 9th century, oil fields were exploited in the area around modern Baku, Azerbaijan. These fields were described by the Arab geographer Abu al-Hasan 'Alؐ al-Mas'dؐ in the 10th century, and by Marco Polo in the 13th century, who described the output of those wells as hundreds of shiploads. Distillation of Petroleum was described by the Persian alchemist, Muhammad ibn Zakarؐya Rzi (Rhazes).[10][unreliable source] There was production of chemicals such as kerosene in the alembic (al-ambiq),[11] which was mainly used for kerosene lamps.[12] Arab and Persian chemists also distilled crude oil in order to produce flammable products for military purposes. Through Islamic Spain, distillation became available in Western Europe by the 12th century.[13] It has also been present in Romania since the 13th century, being recorded as p?cur?.[14]\\r\\nThe earliest mention of petroleum in the Americas occurs in Sir Walter Raleigh's account of the Trinidad Pitch Lake in 1595; while thirty-seven years later, the account of a visit of a Franciscan, Joseph de la Roche d'Allion, to the oil springs of New York was published in Gabriel Sagard's Histoire du Canada. A Finnish born Swede, scientist and student of Carl Linnaeus, Peter Kalm, in his work Travels into North America published first in 1753 showed on a map the oil springs of Pennsylvania.[1]\\r\\nIn 1710 or 1711 (sources vary) the Russian-born Swiss physician and Greek teacher Eirini d'Eyrinys (also spelled as Eirini d'Eirinis) discovered asphaltum at Val-de-Travers, (Neuchatel). He established a bitumen mine de la Presta there in 1719 that operated until 1986.[15][16][17][18]\\r\\nIn 1745 under the Empress Elizabeth of Russia the first oil well and refinery were built in Ukhta by Fiodor Priadunov. Through the process of distillation of the \\"rock oil\\" (petroleum) he received a kerosene-like substance, which was used in oil lamps by Russian churches and monasteries (though households still relied on candles).[19]\\r\\nOil sands were mined from 1745 in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, Alsace under the direction of Louis Pierre Ancillon de la Sablonnire, by special appointment of Louis XV.[20][21] The Pechelbronn oil field was active until 1970, and was the birthplace of companies like Antar and Schlumberger. The first modern refinery was built there in 1857.[20]\\r\\nThe modern history of petroleum began in the 19th century with the refining of paraffin from crude oil. The Scottish chemist James Young in 1847 noticed a natural petroleum seepage in the Riddings colliery at Alfreton, Derbyshire from which he distilled a light thin oil suitable for use as lamp oil, at the same time obtaining a thicker oil suitable for lubricating machinery. In 1846, Baku (settlement Bibi-Heybat) the first ever well drilled with percussion tools to a depth of 21 meters for oil exploration. In 1848, Young set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorized that it somehow originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought that it might be produced artificially.\\r\\nFollowing up this idea, he tried many experiments and eventually succeeded, by distilling cannel coal at a low heat, a fluid resembling petroleum, which when treated in the same way as the seep oil gave similar products. Young found that by slow distillation he could obtain a number of useful liquids from it, one of which he named \\"paraffine oil\\" because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance resembling paraffin wax.[22]\\r\\nThe production of these oils and solid paraffin wax from coal formed the subject of his patent dated 17 October 1850. In 1850 Young & Meldrum and Edward William Binney entered into partnership under the title of E.W. Binney & Co. at Bathgate in West Lothian and E. Meldrum & Co. at Glasgow; their works at Bathgate were completed in 1851 and became the first truly commercial oil-works and oil refinery in the world, using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite, shale, and bituminous coal to manufacture naphtha and lubricating oils; paraffin for fuel use and solid paraffin were not sold till 1856.\\r\\nAbraham Pineo Gesner, a Canadian geologist developed a process to refine a liquid fuel from coal, bitumen and oil shale. His new discovery, which he named kerosene, burned more cleanly and was less expensive than competing products, such as whale oil. In 1850, Gesner created the Kerosene Gaslight Company and began installing lighting in the streets in Halifax and other cities. By 1854, he had expanded to the United States where he created the North American Kerosene Gas Light Company at Long Island, New York. Demand grew to where his companys capacity to produce became a problem, but the discovery of petroleum, from which kerosene could be more easily produced, solved the supply problem.\\r\\nIn 1848 first modern oil well is drilled in Asia, on the Aspheron Peninsula north-east of Baku, by Russian engineer F.N. Semyenov.[23]\\r\\nIgnacy ?ukasiewicz improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \\"rock oil\\" (\\"petr-oleum\\") seeps, in 1852, and the first rock oil mine was built in B܇brka, near Krosno in central European Galicia (Poland) in 1854. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world, and Meerzoeff built the first modern Russian refinery in the mature oil fields at Baku in 1861. At that time Baku produced about 90% of the world's oil.\\r\\nThe question of what constituted the first commercial oil well is a difficult one to answer. Edwin Drake's 1859 well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, discussed more fully below, is popularly considered the first modern well.[24] Drake's well is probably singled out because it was drilled, not dug; because it used a steam engine; because there was a company associated with it; and because it touched off a major boom. However, the first well ever drilled anywhere in the world, which produced oil, was drilled in 1857 to a depth of 280 feet by the American Merrimac Company in La Brea (Spanish for Pitch) in southeast Trinidad in the Caribbean [25]. Additionally, there was considerable activity before Drake in various parts of the world in the mid-19th century. A group directed by Major Alexeyev of the Bakinskii Corps of Mining Engineers hand-drilled a well in the Baku region in 1848.[26] There were engine-drilled wells in West Virginia in the same year as Drake's well.[27] An early commercial well was hand dug in Poland in 1853, and another in nearby Romania in 1857. At around the same time the world's first, but small, oil refineries were opened at Jas?o, in Poland, with a larger one being opened at Ploie?ti, in Romania, shortly after. Romania is the first country in the world to have its crude oil output officially recorded in international statistics, namely 275 tonnes.[28][29] In 1875, crude oil was discovered by David Beaty at his home in Warren, Pennsylvania. This led to the opening of the Bradford oil field, which, by the 1880s, produced 77 percent of the global oil supply. However, by the end of the 19th century, the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, had taken the lead in production.[30]\\r\\nSamuel Kier established America's first oil refinery in Pittsburgh on Seventh avenue near Grant Street, in 1853. In addition to the activity in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, an important early oil well in North America was in Oil Springs, Ontario, Canada in 1858, dug by James Miller Williams.[31] The discovery at Oil Springs touched off an oil boom which brought hundreds of speculators and workers to the area. New oil fields were discovered nearby throughout the late 19th century and the area developed into a large petrochemical refining centre and exchange.[32] The modern US petroleum industry is considered to have begun with Edwin Drake's drilling of a 69-foot (21?m) oil well in 1859,[33] on Oil Creek near Titusville, Pennsylvania, for the Seneca Oil Company (originally yielding 25 barrels per day (4.0?m3/d), by the end of the year output was at the rate of 15 barrels per day (2.4?m3/d)). The industry grew through the 1800s, driven by the demand for kerosene and oil lamps. It became a major national concern in the early part of the 20th century; the introduction of the internal combustion engine provided a demand that has largely sustained the industry to this day. Early \\"local\\" finds like those in Pennsylvania and Ontario were quickly outpaced by demand, leading to \\"oil booms\\" in Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, and California.\\r\\nBy 1910, significant oil fields had been discovered in the Dutch East Indies (1885, in Sumatra), Persia (1908, in Masjed Soleiman), Peru (1863, in Zorritos District), Venezuela (1914, in Maracaibo Basin), and Mexico, and were being developed at an industrial level. Significant oil fields were exploited in Alberta (Canada) from 1947. First offshore oil drilling at Oil Rocks (Neft Dashlari) in the Caspian Sea off Azerbaijan eventually resulted in a city built on pylons in 1949. Availability of oil and access to it, became of \\"cardinal importance\\" in military power before[34] and after World War I, particularly for navies as they changed from coal, but also with the introduction of motor transport, tanks and airplanes.[35] Such thinking would continue in later conflicts of the twentieth century, including World War II, during which oil facilities were a major strategic asset and were extensively bombed.[36] In 1938, vast reserves of oil were discovered in the Al-Ahsa region along the coast of the Persian Gulf.\\r\\nUntil the mid-1950s coal was still the world's foremost fuel, but after this time oil quickly took over. Later, following the 1973 and 1979 energy crises, there was significant media coverage on the subject of oil supply levels. This brought to light the concern that oil is a limited resource that will eventually run out, at least as an economically viable energy source. Although at the time the most common and popular predictions were quite dire, a period of increased production and reduced demand in the following years caused an oil glut in the 1980s. This was not to last, however, and by the first decade of the 21st century discussions about peak oil had returned to the news.\\r\\nToday, about 90% of vehicular fuel needs are met by oil. Petroleum also makes up 40% of total energy consumption in the United States, but is responsible for only 2% of electricity generation. Petroleum's worth as a portable, dense energy source powering the vast majority of vehicles and as the base of many industrial chemicals makes it one of the world's most important commodities.\\r\\nThe top three oil producing countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States.[37] About 80% of the world's readily accessible reserves are located in the Middle East, with 62.5% coming from the Arab 5: Saudi Arabia (12.5%), UAE, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait. However, with high oil prices (above $100/barrel), Venezuela has larger reserves than Saudi Arabia due to its crude reserves derived from bitumen.\\r\\n29. ^ www.geohelp.net/world.html\\r\\n30. ^ www.azer.com/.../102_oil_chronology.html\\r\\n31. ^ archives.datapages.com/data/phi/v12_2011/yusif.pdf\\r\\n32. ^ www.energy-101.org/non-renewable-energy/petroleum-facts/petroleum-history","input":"When did the modern oil industry come into being?"},{"output":"4 February 2012","context":"This is a list of the last World War I veterans to die by country.

The title is currently held by Brock Lesnar, who is in his first reign and is the longest reigning champion.\\r\\nNamed in honor of the WWE Universe,[5] the championship was established on July 25, 2016 to be the world championship of the Raw brand. Its creation came as a result of the re-introduction of the brand extension and subsequent draft on July 19, 2016, in which the WWE Championship, the promotion's original world title, became exclusive to SmackDown.[6] The inaugural Universal Champion was Finn Blor. Since its inception, matches for the championship have headlined several of the Raw brand's pay-per-view events, including SummerSlam 2017, which is one of WWE's \\"Big Four\\" pay-per-views,[7] as well as a dual-branded event.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the reintroduction of the WWE brand extension,[9][10] a draft took place on the SmackDown Live premiere episode on July 19, 2016 and then-WWE Champion Dean Ambrose was drafted to the SmackDown brand.[6] At Battleground on July 24, Ambrose successfully defended the title in a triple threat match against Raw draftees Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns.[11] When Ambrose retained the title, Raw was left without a world title.[12] On the following episode of Raw, Raw commissioner Stephanie McMahon and then-Raw general manager Mick Foley created the WWE Universal Championship to serve as the brand's top championship.[5] According to Foley, the title was named in honor of the WWE Universe, the name WWE uses to refer to its fan base. In response, the WWE Championship was subsequently renamed to WWE World Championship before reverting to the former name in December 2016.[5]\\r\\nThe inaugural champion was crowned at SummerSlam on August 21, 2016 in a singles match. Seth Rollins was automatically set for that match as he was Raw's number one draft pick and was not pinned in the WWE Championship match at Battleground. His opponent was determined by two fatal four-way matches on Raw, with the winners wrestling each other in a singles match.[5] Finn Blor won the first fatal four-way by defeating Cesaro, Kevin Owens, and Rusev, while Roman Reigns won the second by defeating Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn, and Sheamus.[5] Blor then defeated Reigns and was added to the title match.[13] At SummerSlam, Blor defeated Rollins to become the inaugural champion, and as a result, Blor became the first WWE wrestler to win a world title in their pay-per-view debut, as well as winning his first world title in less than a month of his debut on WWE's main roster.[14]\\r\\nThe title belt was unveiled at SummerSlam and is similar in appearance to the WWE Championship, with a few notable differences. The strap is red, to symbolize its exclusivity to the Raw brand, with the underline of the WWE logo in the center plate being black to make it visible (essentially the reverse of the WWE Championship belt). As the championship belt is similar to the WWE Championship, the center plate is a large cut out of the WWE logo with diamonds sitting inside an irregular heptagonal plate, with the capital words \\"Universal Champion\\" in small print sitting underneath the logo. Each side plate, sitting on the other side of gold divider bars, features the same default side plates of the WWE Championship, with the champion's logo able to be customized for the side plates as a similarity of the name plate feature.[15]\\r\\nThe Universal Championship design was heavily criticized;[16] Jason Powell of Pro Wrestling Dot Net referred to it as \\"a title belt that no one likes\\".[17] Adam Silverstein of CBS Sports described it as \\"ugly\\",[18] while the SummerSlam audience gave derisive chants including \\"This belt sucks\\"[19] ÿ an assessment with which New England Sports Network reporters agreed.[20] That site's Ricky Doyle wrote that the crowd response turned what should have been a \\"landmark moment for the company\\" into an \\"awkward experience\\".[21] Mike Johnson of PWInsider felt the title looked like a \\"xerox\\" of the WWE Championship, and did not blame the audience for reacting negatively.[22] The design was also unpopular with online wrestling fans.[19]\\r\\nWWE employees responded in the aftermath of the title's debut. Seth Rollins chastised the SummerSlam crowd's reaction, writing on Twitter: \\"More important than a title's appearance is what it represents for the men fighting over it. You really let me down tonight, Brooklyn\\".[21] Mick Foley, while acknowledging that he himself might have chosen a different belt design, echoed Rollins' response in a lengthy Facebook post. He recalled being presented with the WWF Hardcore Championship, a title belt made of broken metal pieces held together by duct tape, which challengers \\"made... mean something by busting [their] asses\\".[23] In a kayfabe promo on the following episode of Raw, the then-villainous Rollins called the championship belt \\"beautiful\\".[17]\\r\\nLater in 2016, Jim Vorel of Paste ranked the title as the worst of nine then contested in WWE, noting its \\"obnoxious\\" design.[16] On the other hand, Nick Schwartz of Fox Sports wrote: \\"It's really not as bad as fans made it seem at SummerSlam. It's fine.\\"[24]\\r\\nAs of November 6, 2017, there have been 4 reigns and 1 vacancy. Finn Blor was the inaugural champion, but was forced to vacate the title due to suffering a legitimate injury in winning the title. Due to this, his reign is the shortest at 22 hours, while Brock Lesnar has the longest reign at 7002218000000000000?218+ days. Kevin Owens is the youngest champion, winning the title at 32 years old, while Goldberg is the oldest when he won it at 50.\\r\\nBrock Lesnar is the current champion in his first reign. He won the championship by defeating Goldberg at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, 2017 in Orlando, Florida.

The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian subcontinent and Tibet, with some peaks in Central Asia. Only those summits are included that, by an objective measure, may be considered individual mountains as opposed to subsidiary peaks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see also Highest unclimbed mountain). A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called topographic prominence or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the \\"parent peak\\"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with 300?m (980?ft) prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7ÿ8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least 500?m (1,640?ft) prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, such as Eiger or Nuptse. A few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in this list.\\r\\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723?m (25,338?ft) to 7,754?m (25,440?ft), but appears to be only 6,973?m (22,877?ft) to 6,987?m (22,923?ft). Some mountains differ by > 100?m (330?ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840?m (29,003?ft) to 8,850?m (29,035?ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\\r\\nThough some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because synthetic aperture radar can and has been used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights and/or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even \\"new\\" mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200?m (23,622?ft) peaks.\\r\\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali, Mount Kilimanjaro and Nanga Parbat are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207?m (13,802?ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203?m (33,474?ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. Ojos del Salado has the greatest rise on Earth13,420?m (44,029?ft) from the summit[citation needed] to the bottom of the Atacama Trench about 560?km (350?mi) away, though most of this rise is not part of the mountain.\\r\\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa (4,169?m or 13,678?ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000?sq?mi or 5,200?km2) and volume (about 10,000?cu?mi or 42,000?km3), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mt. Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245?sq?mi or 635?km2) and volume (1,150?cu?mi or 4,793?km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120?sq?mi or 311?km2).\\r\\nThe highest mountains above sea level are also not those with peaks farthest from the centre of the Earth, because the figure of the Earth is not spherical. Sea level closer to the equator is several kilometres farther from the centre of the Earth. The summit of Chimborazo, Ecuador's tallest mountain, is usually considered to be the farthest point from the Earth's centre, although the southern summit of Peru's tallest mountain, Huascarn, is another contender.[1] Both have elevations above sea level more than 2?km less than that of Everest.\\r\\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. In fact, all 7,000?m (23,000?ft) peaks in the world are located in the centre of Asia (East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia) in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492?m or 24,580?ft) on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in the West, Jengish Chokusu, (Tum'r Fng) (7,439?m or 24,406?ft) on the Kyrgyzstan ÿ Xinjiang border to the North, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka) (7,556?m or 24,790?ft) in Sichuan to the East, and Kabru (7,412?m or 24,318?ft) on the Sikkim (India) ÿ Nepal border to the South.\\r\\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,962?m or 22,841?ft), which one list has ranking 189th in the world amongst mountains with a 500?m or 1,640?ft prominence cutoff.[2]\\r\\nThe following graph ranks the countries by number of mountain peaks over 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) above sea level.

It was set in the 1870s and 1880s in the fictional town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory. The show was filmed in black and white, in half-hour episodes. The Rifleman aired on ABC from September 30, 1958, to April 8, 1963, as a production of Four Star Television. It was one of the first prime time series on American television to show a widowed parent raising a child.\\r\\nThe program was titled to reflect McCain's use of a Winchester rifle, customized to allow repeated firing by cycling its lever action. He demonstrated this technique in the opening credits of every episode, as well as a second modification that allowed him to cycle the action with one hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series centers on Lucas McCain, a Union Civil War veteran and widower. McCain had been a lieutenant in the 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, and he had received a battlefield commission at the Battle of Five Forks just before the end of the war.[2] Having previously been a homesteader, McCain buys a ranch outside the fictitious town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory, in the pilot episode. He and his son Mark had come from Enid, Oklahoma, following the death of his wife when his son was six years old.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe series was set during the 1880s; a wooden plaque next to the McCain home states that the home was rebuilt by Lucas McCain and his son Mark in August 1881.[citation needed]\\r\\nA common thread in the series is that people deserve a second chance; Marshal Micah Torrance is a recovering alcoholic, and McCain gives a convict a job on his ranch in \\"The Marshal\\". Royal Dano appeared in \\"The Sheridan Story\\" as a former Confederate soldier who is given a job on the McCain ranch and encounters General Philip Sheridan, the man who cost him his arm in battle. Learning why the man wants him dead, Sheridan arranges for medical care for his wounded former foe, quoting Abraham Lincoln's last orders to \\"... bind up the nation's wounds\\".[3]\\r\\nMcCain has human foibles. In \\"Death Trap\\", an episode with Philip Carey as former gunman (and old adversary) Simon Battles, he is unwilling to believe the man has changed and become a doctor. It takes a gunfight (with Battles fighting alongside him) to make him admit he is wrong. In \\"Two Ounces Of Tin\\", with Sammy Davis Jr. as Tip Corey (a former circus trick-shot artist turned gunman), McCain angrily orders him off the ranch when he finds him demonstrating his skills to Mark. McCain has a reputation in the Indian Territory of Oklahoma, where he first acquired the nickname \\"the Rifleman\\", and where his wife had died in a smallpox epidemic.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeven actors played the town doctor during the series (usually known as \\"Doc Burrage\\"): Edgar Buchanan, Fay Roope, Rhys Williams, Jack Kruschen, Robert Burton, Ralph Moody and Bert Stevens. Several actors also played blacksmith Nels Swenson.\\r\\nMore than 500 actors made guest appearances in more than 970 credited roles during the five-year run of the series.[4] Guest stars included veteran actors: John Anderson, Richard Anderson, Whit Bissell, John Carradine, Lon Chaney, Jr., Ellen Corby, Sammy Davis, Jr., John Dehner, Jack Elam, Med Flory, Dabbs Greer, Rodolfo Hoyos, Jr., L.Q. Jones, John Milford, Rex Holman, Agnes Moorehead, Denver Pyle, and Lee Van Cleef, most appearing multiple times in different roles. Several then-newcomers also appeared in the series, including Claude Akins, James Coburn (credited as \\"Jim\\") Mark Goddard, Dan Blocker, Dennis Hopper, Michael Landon, Warren Oates, Harry Dean Stanton, Robert Vaughn, and Robert Culp. Notable people in other fields also made cameo appearances such as future baseball Hall of Famers Duke Snider and Don Drysdale, comedian Buddy Hackett and writer, director and producer Paul Mazursky.[4]\\r\\nThe series was created by Arnold Laven and developed by Sam Peckinpah, who would become a director of Western movies. Peckinpah, who wrote and directed many early episodes, based many characters and plots on his own childhood on a ranch. His insistence on violent realism and complex characterizations, as well as his refusal to sugarcoat the lessons he felt the Rifleman's son needed to learn about life, put him at odds with the show's producers at Four Star. Peckinpah left the show and created a short-lived series, The Westerner, with Brian Keith.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe opening theme at the beginning of each episode depicted McCain walking down the street of a town while rapid-firing his Winchester 44-40 1892 model rifle that had been modified at the trigger and lever. The rifle's modification allowed McCain to fire the rifle only by hand pumping the lever, which had a pin imbedded in it to trip the weapon's trigger.[5] At various points during the series, episodes would show McCain deftly handling and shooting the rifle ambidextrously.[6]\\r\\nWesterns were popular when The Rifleman premiered, and producers tried to find gimmicks to distinguish one show from another. The Rifleman's gimmick was a modified Winchester Model 1892 rifle, with a large ring lever drilled and tapped for a set screw. The lever design allowed him to cock the rifle by spinning it around his hand. In addition, the screw could be positioned to depress the trigger every time he worked the lever, allowing for rapid fire, emptying the magazine in under five seconds during the opening credits on North Fork's main street.\\r\\nThe #8-32 UNC trigger-trip screw pin was used in two configurations: with the screw head turned inside (close to the trigger) or, more often, outside the trigger guard with a locknut on the outside (to secure its position). In some episodes, the screw was removed, when rapid-fire action was not required. When properly adjusted, the screw squeezed the trigger when the lever was fully closed. The rapid-fire mechanism was originally designed to keep Connors from puncturing his finger with the trigger as he quickly cycled the action of the rifle. With this modification, it was not necessary for Connors to pull the trigger for each shot and therefore he did not have to place his finger in harm's way.\\r\\nThe rifle may have appeared in every episode, but it was not always fired; some plots did not require violent solutions (for example, one involving Mark's rigid new teacher). McCain attempts to solve as many problems as possible without resorting to shooting, yet still manages to kill 120 villains over the show's five-year run. It is notable that McCain almost never carried a pistol.\\r\\nThe rifle was an anachronism, as the show was set 12 years before John Browning designed any such rifle.\\r\\nThe rifle used on the set of The Rifleman, an 1892 Winchester caliber .44-40 carbine with a standard 20-inch barrel, appeared with two different types of lever. The backwards, round-D-style loop was used in the early episodes. Sometimes the rifle McCain uses has a saddle ring (the purpose of this ring is to allow the rider to tie the gun with a lanyard, to secure it in the scabbard). The lever style later changed to a flatter lever (instead of the large loop) with no saddle ring.\\r\\nMcCain fires 12 shots from his rifle during the opening credits: seven shots in the first close-up and five more as the camera switches to another view. The blank cartridges are shorter than standard cartridges, so the magazine will hold more of the blanks. The soundtrack contained a dubbed 13th shot, to allow the firing to end with a section of the theme music. The rifle was chambered for the .44/40 W.C.F. (Winchester Center Fire) cartridge, which was used in both revolvers and rifles.[7] He could supposedly fire off his first round in three-tenths of a second, which certainly helped in a showdown.\\r\\nGunsmith James S. Stembridge modified two Model 1892s for use in regular and close-up filming.[8] In addition, a Spanish-made Grate y Anit~a \\"El Tigre\\" lever action, a near-copy of the Model 1892, was modified for use as a knockabout gun. The El Tigre is seen in scenes where the rifle is in a saddle scabbard and is not drawn; and in stunts where the rifle was thrown to the ground, used as a club, or in any stunt where there was the possibility of damage to the original Winchester 1892s.[9] These three rifles were the only ones used by Connors during the run of the series.\\r\\nThe now-defunct Stembridge Gunsmiths provided the rifles and ammunition. Ammunition was quarter-load 5-in-1 blank cartridges containing smokeless powder, which did not produce the thick clouds of smoke the genuine black powder cartridges of the 1880s did. Most (if not all) of the sound effects for the rifle shots were dubbed, which is why the rifle sounded so different from the other gunshots on the show.\\r\\nThe 1892 Winchester is a top-eject rifle (opening the action by pushing the finger-lever forward moves the bolt rearward and thereby opens the top of the receiver). Loaded rounds or empty cases from the chamber eject straight up when the lever is pushed fully open (forward). When Connors cycled the action by spinning the rifle to his side, the cartridge in the action could fall out. Therefore, the rifle was modified with a plunger, which would hold the round in place.\\r\\nThe Winchester Model 1892 rifle was designed by John Moses Browning and, other than general appearance, it has nothing in common with earlier lever-action rifles using the same class of cartridges. The significant improvement was the addition of vertical lugs that securely lock the bolt and receiver when the gun fires. Winchester originally produced this gun from 1892 to 1941; total production was slightly over 1,000,000. 27 variations in five chamberings were made over the course of production, but the basic design was largely unaltered. As with the earlier Model 1873, the light and handy Model 1892 was chambered for handgun cartridges, favored by many Westerners to simplify ammunition supply problems by using the same cartridge in both a handgun and a rifle. The Model 1892 was replaced by the Browning-designed Model 1894, which also had an impressive manufacturing history, with over 7,000,000 produced; it is still being produced to this day by a successor to Winchester. The Model 94's popularity and long production history may be related to its being the first Winchester to be designed for the then-new \\"smokeless\\" powder.\\r\\nThe pilot episode, \\"The Sharpshooter\\", was originally telecast on CBS as part of Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre on March 7, 1958; it was repeated (in edited form) as the first episode of the series on ABC. The episode was written by Sam Peckinpah, and guest starred Dennis Hopper.\\r\\nRegulars on the program included Marshal Micah Torrance (R. G. Armstrong was the original marshal for two episodes, the first and the fourth), Sweeney the bartender (Bill Quinn), and a half-dozen other residents of North Fork (played by Hope Summers, Joan Taylor, Patricia Blair, John Harmon, and Harlan Warde).\\r\\nFifty-one episodes of the series were directed by Joseph H. Lewis (director of 1950s Gun Crazy and known for his film noir style). Ida Lupino directed one episode, \\"The Assault\\".\\r\\nConnors wrote several episodes. Robert Culp (of CBS's Trackdown, another Four Star-produced series), wrote one two-part episode, and Frank Gilroy wrote \\"End of a Young Gun\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nMPI Home Video has released The Rifleman on DVD in Region 1 in a number of versions. It has released single-disc DVDs with five episodes; from 2002ÿ2006 it released six sets, each with 20 episodes. The releases are random collections of episodes, rather than the original broadcast order. These releases are out of print, since MPI Home Video no longer owns the rights to the series. Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions, the original producer, is again the sole copyright owner of The Rifleman series.[11]\\r\\nIn late 2013, Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions, Inc. announced it would be the only authorized outlet to offer for the very first time all 168 episodes of The Rifleman, the original series, newly restored and assembled in DVD box sets. The episodes will be released in sequential order, by season, in high quality boxed sets with exclusive special features. The first boxed set of all Season 1 episodes were made available on December 4, 2013 for $69.95.[12] The second season was released on November 28, 2014.[13] Season 3 was released on December 2, 2015.[14] Season 4 was released on December 4, 2016.[15][16] Season 5 was released on November 27, 2017.[17]\\r\\nThe February 17, 1959 episode of The Rifleman was a pilot for an NBC series, Law of the Plainsman, starring Michael Ansara as Marshal Sam Buckhart. In the episode \\"The Indian\\", Buckhart comes to North Fork to look for Indians suspected of murdering a Texas Ranger and his family.[18] He subsequently reappeared in \\"The Raid\\".\\r\\nChuck Connors briefly played the same character again in 1991's The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw, which featured a number of 1950s and 1960s television Western series leads reprising their roles in quick cameo appearances (Gene Barry as Bat Masterson, Hugh O'Brian as Wyatt Earp, Jack Kelly as Bart Maverick, Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie, David Carradine as Kung Fu's Caine).\\r\\nIn late 2011, CBS announced plans to remake the original Rifleman series.[19] Chris Columbus was slated to be the executive producer and direct, with Robert Levy, Steven Gardner, and Arthur Gardner (related to original producers Levy-Gardner-Laven) as executive producers.[20] The remake project was canceled a few months later, without a pilot episode being made.[21]\\r\\nThe TV show was also adapted into a comic book by Dan Spiegle, distributed by Dell Comics.[22]","input":"What caliber of rifle did the rifleman use?"},{"output":"Dilawar Khan Ghuri","context":"The Malwa Sultanate was a late medieval kingdom presumably of Turkic origin, in the Malwa region of the present day Madhya Pradesh state in India in 1392ÿ1562.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sultanate of Malwa was founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, the governor of Malwa for the Delhi Sultanate, who asserted his independence in 1392, but did not actually assume the ensigns of royalty till 1401. Initially Dhar was the capital of the new kingdom, but soon it was shifted to Mandu, which was renamed Shadiabad (the city of joy). After his death, he was succeeded by his son Alp Khan, who assumed the title of Hoshang Shah. The Ghurid dynasty, founded by Dilawar Khan Ghuri, was replaced by Mahmud Shah I, who proclaimed himself king on May 16, 1436. The Khalji dynasty, founded by him, ruled over Malwa till 1531. Mahmud Khalji I was succeeded by his eldest son Ghiyas-ud-Din. The last days of Ghiyas-ud-Din were embittered by a struggle for throne between his two sons, with Nasir-ud-Din emerging victorious over Ala-ud-Din and ascending the throne on October 22, 1500, Before Ghiyas ud din dead a group of saint going to Hajj their leader Imam mahdi Syed Muhammad Jaunpuri Alaisalam come to Mandu the capital city of that time history know about his followers number & Ghiyas-ud-Din also belief him has a imam mahdi & become Mahdavia. The last ruler Mahmud Shah II surrendered to Bahadur Shah, the sultan of Gujarat after the fort of Mandu fell to Bahadur on May 25, 1531.[1]\\r\\nDuring 1531 ÿ 1537 the kingdom was under the control of Bahadur Shah, though the Mughal padshah (emperor) Humayun captured it for a short period during 1535-36. In 1537, Qadir Shah, an ex-officer of the previous Khalji dynasty rulers, regained control over a part of the erstwhile kingdom. But in 1542, Sher Shah Suri conquered the kingdom, defeating him and appointed Shuja'at Khan as the governor. His son, Baz Bahadur, declared himself independent in 1555. In 1561, Akbar the Great's Mughal army, led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan, attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March 1561. Akbar soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur, but he was defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar Sultanate and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa. Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a short period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army, led by Abdullah Khan, an Uzbeg, which finally defeated Baz Bahadur. He fled to Chittor.[2] It became the Malwa Subah (top-level province) of the Mughal empire, with seat at Ujjain and Abdullah Khan became its first governor.\\r\\nMany remarkable illustrated manuscripts were prepared during the period of the sultanate. An illustrated manuscript of Kalpa Sutra (1439) (presently in the National Museum, Delhi) was prepared in Mandu during the reign of Mahmud Shah I[3] But the most interesting is a manuscript of the Nimat Nama, a treatise on the art of cooking, which bears many portraits of Ghiyas-ud-Din Shah but the colophon bears the name of Nasir-ud-Din Shah. The other notable illustrated manuscripts of this period are of the Miftah-ul-Fuzala, a dictionary of rare words, the Bustan (1502) painted by Haji Mahmud and the Aja'ib-us-San'ati (1508). Another manuscript of the Anwar-i-Suhaili (now in the National Museum, Delhi) probably also belong to this period.[4]\\r\\nThe monuments built during the sultanate period are almost concentrated in Mandu city. The early monuments were assembled out of the materials of earlier Hindu temples, according to the Islamic plan and convention. But nothing seems to have been done to conceal or alter their essential Hindu appearance. The significant among them are the Kamal Maula Masjid (c.1400), the Lal Masjid (1405), Dilawar Khan's Masjid (c.1405) and the Masjid of Malik Mughis (1452) in Mandu.[5]\\r\\nHoshang Shah laid the foundation of the Mandu fort on the ruins of the original fortification. With him began the second and the classical phase of Malwa architecture. Some of the ten gateways on the 25 miles long wall of the fortress of Mandu were built by the Malwa sultans, the earliest one being the Delhi Darwaza (northern gateway). Within the walls of the fortress, presently only forty structures survive in different stages of preservation. The largest and most impressive of them is Jami Masjid, which according to an inscription was begun by Hoshang Shah and completed by Mahmud Shah I in 1454. The remarkable Durbar hall, known as the Hindola Mahal is also attributed to Hoshang Shah. Opposite to Jami Masjid, the large structural complex known as the Ashrafi Mahal comprises a group of buildings successively built in course of a rather long period. Its original nucleus seems to be a madrasa building erected as an adjunct to the Jami Masjid, probably during the reign of Hoshang Shah. According to Firishta, the tomb of Hoshang Shah was built by Mahmud Shah I. The later mausoleums, such as the tomb of Darya Khan, the Dai ka Mahal and the Chhappan Mahal were built on the same design. A long structural complex situated between two lakes has a curious name, the Jahaz Mahal (ship-palace). Though the date of this monument is not definitely known, its general style is in accord with the character of Ghiyas-ud-Din Khalji. A lonely building on the slope of a hill by the side of Riwa Kund is known by the local people as Baz Bahadur's palace. According to an inscription this monument was actually built by Nasir-ud-Din Shah. The Rani Rupmati Pavilion stands on the southern edge of the plateau and as its situation and form indicate, was, in all probability, designed for military purposes.[5]\\r\\nSilver half tanka of Nasir Shah dated (AH) 915 (= 1509ÿ1510 CE)\\r\\nSilver half tanka of Muhammad Shah II dated (AH) 917 (= 1511ÿ1512 CE)\\r\\nSilver tanka of Baz Bahadur","input":"Who founded the independent muslim kingdom of malwa?"},{"output":"that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce","context":"Darwinism is a theory of biological evolution developed by the English naturalist Charles Darwin (1809ÿ1882) and others, stating that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and reproduce. Also called Darwinian theory, it originally included the broad concepts of transmutation of species or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the Weismann barrier, or the central dogma of molecular biology.[1] Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, creationists have appropriated it to refer to the origin of life, and it has even been applied to concepts of cosmic evolution, both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' workin place of other theories, including divine design and extraterrestrial origins.[2][3]\\r\\nEnglish biologist Thomas Henry Huxley coined the term Darwinism in April 1860.[4] It was used to describe evolutionary concepts in general, including earlier concepts published by English philosopher Herbert Spencer. Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called Lamarckism. The strict neo-Darwinism of German evolutionary biologist August Weismann gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called \\"the eclipse of Darwinism,\\" scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms which eventually proved untenable. The development of the modern synthesis in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with population genetics and Mendelian genetics, revived Darwinism in an updated form.[5]\\r\\nWhile the term Darwinism has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as Olivia Judson and Eugenie Scott that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory.[6][7] For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel,[8] and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of heredity. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of genetic drift, for example.[9][10] In the United States, creationists often use the term \\"Darwinism\\" as a pejorative term in reference to beliefs such as scientific materialism, but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, with evolution by natural selection.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the term Darwinism had been used previously to refer to the work of Erasmus Darwin in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the Westminster Review.[12] Having hailed the book as \\"a veritable Whitworth gun in the armoury of liberalism\\" promoting scientific naturalism over theology, and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's gradualism and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species,[13] Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of Nicolaus Copernicus in explaining planetary motion:\\r\\nWhat if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of \\"The Origin of Species\\" an immense debt of gratitude.... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's \\"Researches on Development,\\" thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.[4]\\r\\nThese are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin.\\r\\nAnother important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist Peter Kropotkin who, in his book Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and sociological arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce competition as the core of evolution, which provided a rationalization for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:\\r\\nIn the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sensenot as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.[14]\\r\\n\\"Darwinism\\" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase \\"survival of the fittest\\" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck than to that of Darwin, and predated the publication of Darwin's theory in 1859. What is now called \\"Social Darwinism\\" was, in its day, synonymous with \\"Darwinism\\"the application of Darwinian principles of \\"struggle\\" to society, usually in support of anti-philanthropic political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin Francis Galton, was that \\"Darwinism\\" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on \\"civilized\\" people, it was possible for \\"inferior\\" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the gene pool) to overwhelm the \\"superior\\" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirablethe foundation of eugenics.\\r\\nIn Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term \\"Darwinism,\\" and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and Ernst Haeckel developed what was known as Darwinismus in Germany, although, like Spencer's \\"evolution,\\" Haeckel's \\"Darwinism\\" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.[15] In 1886, Alfred Russel Wallace went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called \\"Darwinism\\" without any problems.[16]\\r\\nIn his book Darwinism (1889), Wallace had used the term pure-Darwinism which proposed a \\"greater efficacy\\" for natural selection.[17][18] George Romanes dubbed this view as \\"Wallaceism\\", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a \\"pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory.\\"[19][20] Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist.[21] Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.[22]\\r\\nThe term Darwinism is often used in the United States by promoters of creationism, notably by leading members of the intelligent design movement, as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an \\"ism\\") of philosophical naturalism, or atheism.[23] For example, UC Berkeley law professor and author Phillip E. Johnson makes this accusation of atheism with reference to Charles Hodge's book What Is Darwinism? (1874).[24] However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist Asa Gray who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: \\"It is Atheism.\\"[25][26] Creationists use the term Darwinism, often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as dogmatic and inflexible in their belief.[27] In the 2008 documentary film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, which promotes intelligent design (ID), American writer and actor Ben Stein refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for Scientific American, John Rennie says \\"The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to Marxism.\\" [28]\\r\\nHowever, Darwinism is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called \\"neo-Darwinism,\\" from those first proposed by Darwin. Darwinism also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, Darwinism may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and gene flow. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the history of evolutionary thoughtparticularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.\\r\\nIn political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. \\"It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like 'Maoism,'\\" says Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson. He adds, \\"Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'.\\"[29] In the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins wrote in his collection of essays A Devil's Chaplain, published in 2003, that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.[30]\\r\\nIn his 1995 book Darwinian Fairytales, Australian philosopher David Stove[31] used the term \\"Darwinism\\" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some \\"Ultra-Darwinists.\\" Stove alleged that by using weak or false ad hoc reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid (e.g., Stove suggested that sociobiological explanation of altruism as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism). Philosopher Simon Blackburn wrote a rejoinder to Stove,[32] though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegee James Franklin's[33] suggested that Blackburn's response actually \\"confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything.\\"","input":"What is the main premise of darwinian evolution?"},{"output":"Raja Ravi Varma.","context":"Shakuntala or Shakuntala looking for Dushyanta is an epic painting by celebrated Indian painter, Raja Ravi Varma.\\r\\n\\r\\nRavi Varma, depicts Shakuntala, an important character of Mahabaratha, pretending to remove a thorn from her foot, while actually looking for her husband/lover, Dushyantha, while her friends call her bluff.\\r\\n\\r\\nTapati Guha Thakurta, an art historian, wrote;\\r\\n\\r\\n[Category:Indian paintings]","input":"Who is the famous painter who painted shakunthala?"},{"output":"People's Uprising in East Germany","context":"?Soviet Union\\r\\n?East Germany\\r\\nThe Uprising of 1953 in East Germany started with a strike by East Berlin construction workers on 16 June 1953. It turned into a widespread uprising against the German Democratic Republic government the next day. In Germany, the revolt is often called People's Uprising in East Germany (Volksaufstand in der DDR).[4] It involved more than one million people in about 700 localities.[5] 17 June was declared a day of national remembrance in West Germany up until reunification. Strikes and working class networks, particularly relating to the old Social Democratic Party of Germany, anti-fascist resistance networks and trade unions played a key role in the unfolding of the uprising.[6]\\r\\nThe uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany and the Volkspolizei. In spite of the intervention of Soviet troops, the wave of strikes and protests was not easily brought under control. Even after 17 June there were demonstrations in more than 500 towns and villages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 1952 the second party conference of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) took place in East Berlin. In SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht's words, there was to be the \\"systematic implementation of Socialism\\" (planm??iger Aufbau des Sozialismus); it was decided that the process of Sovietization should be intensified and the importance of the state expanded. The party was acting on demands made by Soviet premier Joseph Stalin.[5]\\r\\nThis meant for example the division of the five L?nder into 14 regions (Bezirke) plus East Berlin. This division marked an assault on the remaining middle stratum of the GDR: farmers who owned land, as well as small business owners/tradesmen, who were being forced to give up their independence through raised charges.\\r\\nThis decision was made amid the background of the catastrophic economic situation in the country. In the course of the militarisation pushed by Soviet authorities, direct and indirect military expenditures rose and already made up around 11% of the national budget in 1952. Together with reparation payments, this totalled over 20% of the budget. The economic policies of the SED favoured the development of heavy industry at the expense of the production of food and consumer goods, all of which resulted in a severe crisis in supplying the public with goods. Electricity was turned off in factories and public buildings at the onset of darkness every evening (during peak period).\\r\\nThe dramatic increase of emigration (Republikflucht, brain drain) in the first half of 1953, already high since the establishment of the GDR, constituted a serious economic and social problem. Another factor that contributed to an already complicated political situation was the high number of political prisoners in the GDR. Suppression of the illegal organisation Junge Gemeinde (Young Congregation), wrongly perceived as the central youth organisation of the Evangelical Church, played a role here. Numerous trainee pastors were imprisoned (e.g. Johannes Hamel and Fritz Hoffmann). Ecclesiastic recreation centres were closed and taken over by the FDJ (e.g.: Schloss Mansfeld and Huberhaus Wernigerode). High school students who belonged to a church were often expelled by the school authorities, sometimes even shortly before school graduation.\\r\\nWithin this complicated background, the decision to raise the work norms (in short the principle 'more work for the same salary') was perceived as a provocation, which would conceivably lead to the deterioration of living standards. The Central Committee decided to address the economic difficulties with a package of changes, which included higher taxes and higher prices, andmost significantlyan increase of the work quotas by 10%.[7]\\r\\nThese changes were coming into force by 30 June 1953, Ulbricht's 60th birthday. Issued as a suggestion, it became in effect a direction that was introduced in all the state-owned enterprises (so-called volkseigene Betriebe) and if the new quotas were not met then workers would have to face a reduction of salaries. The decision was taken on 13ÿ14 May 1953, and the Council of Ministers approved it on 28 May.\\r\\nFollowing Stalin's death in March 1953 and the massive increase in emigration the new Soviet government decided to ease the policies Stalin had demanded. On 4 June 1953, the Soviet government, alarmed at reports of unrest, summoned East German leaders to Moscow. Georgy Malenkov warned them that if policy direction were not corrected immediately, there would be a catastrophe.[8] After intense discussion the East German party eased policies and publicly admitted that mistakes had been made. However, according to the historian of East Germany, Manfred Wilke, that admission may have had the unintended effect of inflaming public opinion rather than easing tensions.[5]\\r\\nOn the morning of 16 June, 300 East Berlin construction workers went on strike and marched down Stalinallee, now Karl-Marx-Allee, towards government buildings after their superiors announced a pay cut if they did not meet their work quota. Things started with a discussion by shop stewards as regards how to respond to recent increase in their work quotas. However, this soon turned into a mass demonstration, which gathered more workers from construction sites as they marched first to the headquarters of the Free German Trade Union Federation. However, dissatisfied with the response there, the protest swelled to over ten thousand as they marched to Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus, the home of the House of Ministries in Leipziger Strasse.[6] They bore banners with such slogans as We demand a quota reduction![6] However soon more political demands were developed such as Workers join us! Unity is Strength! We want free elections! and We want to be free, not slaves. [6] They then demanded that Walter Ulbricht come out to speak to them. When a minor official informed the crowd that their original demand about quotas had been met, this failed to satisfy the protestors who started developing other demands until a young engineer made the suggestion that they put out a call for general strike the next day. These events were reported by the West Berlin-based Radio in the American Sector which helped spread news of the intended strike.[9] Also independent networks which had been formed within the old Social Democratic Party of Germany, which had been forcibly merged into the SED, the trade unions and the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime - which had recently been dissolved by the authorities - were an element in this self-organisation.[6]\\r\\nEarly on 17 June 40,000 protesters had gathered in East Berlin, with more arriving throughout the morning. Many protests were held throughout East Germany with at least some work stoppages and protests in virtually all industrial centers and large cities in the country. Joint strike committees were established in Hennigsdorf, G?rlitz, Cottbus and Gera.\\r\\nThe original demands of the protesters, such as the reinstatement of the previous lower work quotas, turned into political demands. SED functionaries took to the streets and began arguing with small groups of protesters. Eventually, the workers demanded the resignation of the East German government. The government decided to violently suppress the uprising and turned to the Soviet Union for military support. In total, around 16 Soviet divisions with 20,000 soldiers as well as 8,000 Kasernierte Volkspolizei members were used to quell the uprising.\\r\\nIn East Berlin, major clashes occurred along Unter den Linden (between the Brandenburger Tor and Marx-Engels-Platz), where Soviet troops and Volkspolizei opened fire,[10] and around Potsdamer Platz, where several people were killed by the Volkspolizei.[11] It is still unclear how many people died during the uprising or were sentenced to death in the aftermath. The number of known victims is 55;[12] other estimates put the number of victims at least 125.[13]\\r\\nEarlier West German estimates of the number of people killed were considerably higher: according to the West German Ministry for Inter-German affairs in 1966, 513 people (including 116 \\"functionaries of the SED regime\\") were killed in the uprising, 106 people were executed under martial law or later condemned to death, 1,838 were injured, and 5,100 were arrested (1,200 of these were later sentenced to an average of 5 years in penal camps). It also was alleged that 17 or 18 Soviet soldiers were executed for refusing to shoot demonstrating workers,[14] but these reports remain unconfirmed by post-1990 research.[15]\\r\\nOn 18 June 1953 Neues Deutschland, the official party publication of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and the daily national newspaper, published an article on its front page titled \\"Was ist in Berlin geschehen? (What occurred in Berlin?)\\" that explained the strike and subsequent uprising to be a direct result of the attempts by \\"western agencies\\" to disrupt the national stability and legitimacy of the SED.[16]\\r\\nOther archived editions of Neues Deutschland document similar comments made by party officials that condemned the influence of American popular culture on German youth. The prominence of American films and music in both East and West Berlin influenced the rise of a subculture of youth commonly known as Halbstarke (lit. half-strengths). American films of the era like The Wild One and Rebel Without a Cause, featuring movie stars Marlon Brando and James Dean, respectively, were viewed by the GDR with romanticizing public disobedience and rebellion, as well as encouraging violent crime. Continued occurrences of crime and uprisings by German youths would eventually lead to the decision by SED party officials to begin construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.[17][page?needed]\\r\\nIn memory of the 1953 East German rebellion, West Germany established 17 June as a national holiday, called \\"Day of German Unity\\". Upon German reunification in October 1990, it was moved to 3 October, the date of formal reunification. The extension of the boulevard Unter den Linden to the west of the Brandenburg Gate, called Charlottenburger Chaussee, was renamed Stra?e des 17. Juni (English: \\"17 June Street\\") following the 1953 rebellion. The event is commemorated in the following poem by Bertolt Brecht:\\r\\nOther prominent GDR authors who dealt with the uprising include Stefan Heym (Fnf Tage im Juni / \\"Five Days in June\\", Munich 1974) and Heiner Mller (Wolokolamsker Chaussee III: Das Duell / \\"Volokolamsk Highway III: The Duel\\", 1985/86).\\r\\nWest German group Alphaville mention the date explicitly as \\"the seventeenth of June\\" but without reference to the year in their 1984 song \\"Summer in Berlin,\\" from the album Forever Young.

It may be the oldest surviving long poem in Old English and is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Old English literature. A date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025.[2] The author was an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the \\"Beowulf poet\\".[3]\\r\\nThe poem is set in Scandinavia. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland (G?taland in modern Sweden) and later becomes king of the Geats. After a period of fifty years has passed, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a tower on a headland in his memory.\\r\\nThe full poem survives in the manuscript known as the Nowell Codex. It has no title in the original manuscript, but has become known by the name of the story's protagonist.[4] In 1731, the manuscript was badly damaged by a fire that swept through Ashburnham House in London that had a collection of medieval manuscripts assembled by Sir Robert Bruce Cotton.[5] The Nowell Codex is currently housed in the British Library.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe events in the poem take place over most of the sixth century, after the Anglo-Saxons had started their journey to England and before the beginning of the seventh century, a time when the Anglo-Saxons were either newly arrived or were still in close contact with their Germanic kinsmen in Northern Germany. The poem may have been brought to England by people of Geatish origins.[6] Many suggest that Beowulf was first composed in the 7th century at Rendlesham in East Anglia, that the Sutton Hoo ship-burial also shows close connections with Scandinavia, and that the East Anglian royal dynasty, the Wuffingas, may have been descendants of the Geatish Wulfings.[7][8] Others have associated this poem with the court of King Alfred the Great or with the court of King Cnut the Great.[9]\\r\\nThe poem deals with legends, was composed for entertainment, and does not separate between fictional elements and real historic events, such as the raid by King Hygelac into Frisia. Though Beowulf himself is not mentioned in any other Anglo-Saxon manuscript,[10] scholars generally agree that many of the other personalities of Beowulf also appear in Scandinavian sources. (Specific works are designated in the following section).[11] This concerns not only individuals (e.g., Healfdene, Hroegar, Halga, Hroeulf, Eadgils and Ohthere), but also clans (e.g., Scyldings, Scylfings and Wulfings) and certain events (e.g., the Battle on the Ice of Lake V?nern). The dating of the events in the poem has been confirmed by archaeological excavations of the barrows indicated by Snorri Sturluson and by Swedish tradition as the graves of Ohthere (dated to c. 530) and his son Eadgils (dated to c. 575) in Uppland, Sweden.[12][13][14]\\r\\nIn Denmark, recent archaeological excavations at Lejre, where Scandinavian tradition located the seat of the Scyldings, i.e., Heorot, have revealed that a hall was built in the mid-6th century, exactly the time period of Beowulf.[15] Three halls, each about 50 metres (160?ft) long, were found during the excavation.[15]\\r\\nThe majority view appears to be that people such as King Hroegar and the Scyldings in Beowulf are based on real historical people from 6th-century Scandinavia.[16] Like the Finnesburg Fragment and several shorter surviving poems, Beowulf has consequently been used as a source of information about Scandinavian personalities such as Eadgils and Hygelac, and about continental Germanic personalities such as Offa, king of the continental Angles.\\r\\n19th-century archaeological evidence may confirm elements of the Beowulf story. Eadgils was buried at Uppsala according to Snorri Sturluson. When Eadgils' mound (to the left in the photo) was excavated in 1874, the finds supported Beowulf and the sagas. They showed that a powerful man was buried in a large barrow, c. 575, on a bear skin with two dogs and rich grave offerings. These remains include a Frankish sword adorned with gold and garnets and a tafl game with Roman pawns of ivory. He was dressed in a costly suit made of Frankish cloth with golden threads, and he wore a belt with a costly buckle. There were four cameos from the Middle East which were probably part of a casket. This would have been a burial fitting a king who was famous for his wealth in Old Norse sources. Ongentheow's barrow has not been excavated.[12][13]\\r\\nThe protagonist Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands and Grendel's mother with a giant's sword that he found in her lair.\\r\\nLater in his life, Beowulf becomes king of the Geats, and finds his realm terrorized by a dragon, some of whose treasure had been stolen from his hoard in a burial mound. He attacks the dragon with the help of his thegns or servants, but they do not succeed. Beowulf decides to follow the dragon to its lair at Earnan?s, but only his young Swedish relative Wiglaf, whose name means \\"remnant of valour\\",[a] dares to join him. Beowulf finally slays the dragon, but is mortally wounded in the struggle. He is cremated and a burial mound by the sea is erected in his honour.\\r\\nBeowulf is considered an epic poem in that the main character is a hero who travels great distances to prove his strength at impossible odds against supernatural demons and beasts. The poem also begins in medias res or simply, \\"in the middle of things,\\" which is a characteristic of the epics of antiquity. Although the poem begins with Beowulf's arrival, Grendel's attacks have been an ongoing event. An elaborate history of characters and their lineages is spoken of, as well as their interactions with each other, debts owed and repaid, and deeds of valour. The warriors form a kind of brotherhood linked by loyalty to their lord. What is unique about \\"Beowulf\\" is that the poem actual begins and ends with a funeral. At the beginning of the poem, the king, hero, Shield Shiefson dies (26-45) and there is a huge funeral for him. At the end of the poem when Beowulf dies, there is also a massive funeral for Beowulf.(3140-3170)\\r\\nBeowulf begins with the story of Hrothgar, who constructed the great hall Heorot for himself and his warriors. In it, he, his wife Wealhtheow, and his warriors spend their time singing and celebrating. Grendel, a troll-like monster said to be descended from the biblical Cain, is pained by the sounds of joy.[19] Grendel attacks the hall and kills and devours many of Hrothgar's warriors while they sleep. Hrothgar and his people, helpless against Grendel, abandon Heorot.\\r\\nBeowulf, a young warrior from Geatland, hears of Hrothgar's troubles and with his king's permission leaves his homeland to assist Hrothgar.[20]\\r\\nBeowulf and his men spend the night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel.[21] When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up to clench Grendel's hand.[22] Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently.[23] Beowulf's retainers draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin.[24] Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies.[25] Beowulf displays \\"the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp\\" for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.[26]\\r\\nThe next night, after celebrating Grendel's defeat, Hrothgar and his men sleep in Heorot. Grendel's mother, angry that her son has been killed, sets out to get revenge. \\"Beowulf was elsewhere. Earlier, after the award of treasure, The Geat had been given another lodging\\" his assistance would be absent in this battle.[27] Grendel's mother violently kills ?schere, who is Hrothgar's most loyal fighter, and escapes.\\r\\nHrothgar, Beowulf and their men track Grendel's mother to her lair under a lake. Unferth, a warrior who had doubted him and wishes to make amends, presents Beowulf with his sword Hrunting. After stipulating a number of conditions to Hrothgar in case of his death (including the taking in of his kinsmen and the inheritance by Unferth of Beowulf's estate), Beowulf jumps into the lake, at the bottom of which he finds a cavern containing Grendel's body and the remains of men that the two have killed. Grendel's mother and Beowulf engage in fierce combat.\\r\\nAt first, Grendel's mother appears to prevail. Beowulf, finding that Hrunting cannot harm his foe, puts it aside in fury. Beowulf is again saved from his opponent's attack by his armour. Beowulf takes another sword from Grendel's mother and slices her head off with it. Travelling further into Grendel's mother's lair, Beowulf discovers Grendel's corpse and severs his head. The blade of Beowulf's sword touches Grendel's toxic blood, and instantly dissolves so that only the hilt remains. Beowulf swims back up to the rim of the pond where his men wait in growing despair. Carrying the hilt of the sword and Grendel's head, he presents them to Hrothgar upon his return to Heorot. Hrothgar gives Beowulf many gifts, including the sword N?gling, his family's heirloom. The events prompt a long reflection by the king, sometimes referred to as \\"Hrothgar's sermon\\", in which he urges Beowulf to be wary of pride and to reward his thegns.[28]\\r\\nBeowulf returns home and eventually becomes king of his own people. One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnan?s. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning everything in sight. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone and that they should wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory. (Beowulf lines 2712ÿ3182).[29]\\r\\nBeowulf was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia; its dating has attracted considerable scholarly attention. The poem has been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries, with some recent scholarship offering what has been called \\"a cohesive and compelling case for Beowulf's early composition.\\"[30][31] However, opinion differs as to whether the composition of the poem is nearly contemporary with its transcription, whether it was first written in the 8th century, or if a proto-version of the poem was perhaps composed at an even earlier time (possibly as one of the Bear's Son Tales) and orally transmitted for many years, then transcribed in its present form at a later date. Albert Lord felt strongly that the manuscript represents the transcription of a performance, though likely taken at more than one sitting.[32] J. R. R. Tolkien believed that the poem retains too genuine a memory of Anglo-Saxon paganism to have been composed more than a few generations after the completion of the Christianisation of England around AD 700,[33] and Tolkien's conviction that the poem dates to the 8th century has been defended by Tom Shippey, Leonard Neidorf, Rafael J. Pascual, and R.D. Fulk, among others.[34][35][36]\\r\\nThe claim to an early 11th-century date depends in part on scholars who argue that, rather than the transcription of a tale from the oral tradition by an earlier literate monk, Beowulf reflects an original interpretation of an earlier version of the story by the manuscript's two scribes. On the other hand, some scholars argue that linguistic, palaeographical, metrical, and onomastic considerations align to support a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century;[31][37][38][39] in particular, the poem's regular observation of etymological length distinctions (Max Kaluza's law) has been thought to demonstrate a date of composition in the first half of the eighth century.[35][36] However, scholars disagree about whether the metrical phenomena described by Kaluza's Law prove an early date of composition or are evidence of a longer prehistory of the Beowulf meter;[40] B.R. Hutcheson, for instance, does not believe Kaluza's Law can be used to date the poem, while claiming that \\"the weight of all the evidence Fulk presents in his book[b] tells strongly in favour of an eighth-century date.\\"[41]\\r\\nBeowulf survives in a single manuscript dated on palaeographical grounds to the late 10th or early 11th century. The manuscript measures 245 G 185?mm.[42]\\r\\nThe poem is known only from a single manuscript, which is estimated to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The Beowulf manuscript is known as the Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is \\"British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library in the middle of the 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. \\"Cotton Vitellius A.XV\\" translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[43]\\r\\nThe earliest extant reference to the first foliation of the Nowell Codex was made sometime between 1628 and 1650 by Franciscus Junius (the younger).[44]:91 The ownership of the codex before Nowell remains a mystery.[44]:120\\r\\nThe Reverend Thomas Smith (1638ÿ1710) and Humfrey Wanley (1672ÿ1726) both catalogued the Cotton library (in which the Nowell Codex was held). Smith's catalogue appeared in 1696, and Wanley's in 1705.[45] The Beowulf manuscript itself is identified by name for the first time in an exchange of letters in 1700 between George Hickes, Wanley's assistant, and Wanley. In the letter to Wanley, Hickes responds to an apparent charge against Smith, made by Wanley, that Smith had failed to mention the Beowulf script when cataloguing Cotton MS. Vitellius A. XV. Hickes replies to Wanley \\"I can find nothing yet of Beowulph.\\"[46] Kiernan theorised that Smith failed to mention the Beowulf manuscript because of his reliance on previous catalogues or because either he had no idea how to describe it or because it was temporarily out of the codex.[47]\\r\\nIt suffered damage in the Cotton Library fire at Ashburnham House in 1731. Since then, parts of the manuscript have crumbled along with many of the letters. Rebinding efforts, though saving the manuscript from much degeneration, have nonetheless covered up other letters of the poem, causing further loss. Kevin Kiernan, in preparing his electronic edition of the manuscript, used fibre-optic backlighting and ultraviolet lighting to reveal letters in the manuscript lost from binding, erasure, or ink blotting.[48]\\r\\nThe Beowulf manuscript was transcribed from an original by two scribes, one of whom wrote the prose at the beginning of the manuscript and the first 1939 lines before breaking off in mid sentence. The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context.[49] While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors.[50] The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him. In the way that it is currently bound, the Beowulf manuscript is followed by the Old English poem Judith. Judith was written by same the scribe that completed Beowulf as evidenced through similar writing style. Worm-holes found in the last leaves of the Beowulf manuscript that aren't present in the Judith manuscript suggest that at one point Beowulf ended the volume. The rubbed appearance of some leaves also suggest that the manuscript stood on a shelf unbound, as is known to have been the case with other Old English manuscripts.[49] From knowledge of books held in the library at Malmesbury Abbey and available as source works, and from the identification of certain words particular to the local dialect found in the text, the transcription may have taken place there.[51]\\r\\nIcelandic scholar Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin made the first transcriptions of the manuscript in 1786 and published the results in 1815, working as part of a Danish government historical research commission. He made one himself, and had another done by a professional copyist who knew no Anglo-Saxon. Since that time, however, the manuscript has crumbled further, making these transcripts a prized witness to the text. While the recovery of at least 2000 letters can be attributed to them, their accuracy has been called into question,[c] and the extent to which the manuscript was actually more readable in Thorkelin's time is uncertain.\\r\\nIn 1805, the historian Sharon Turner translated selected verses into modern English.[53] This was followed in 1814 by John Josias Conybeare who published an edition \\"in English paraphrase and Latin verse translation.\\"[53] In 1815, Grmur J܇nsson Thorkelin published the first complete edition in Latin.[53] N. F. S. Grundtvig reviewed this edition in 1815 and created the first complete verse translation in Danish in 1820.[53] In 1837, John Mitchell Kemble created an important literal translation in English.[53] In 1895, William Morris & A. J. Wyatt published the ninth English translation.[53] Many retellings of Beowulf for children also appeared around the beginning of the 20th century.[54] In 1909, Francis Barton Gummere's full translation in \\"English imitative meter\\" was published,[53] and was used as the text of Gareth Hinds's graphic novel based on Beowulf in 2007.\\r\\nDuring the early 20th century, Frederick Klaeber's Beowulf and The Fight at Finnsburg[55] (which included the poem in Old English, an extensive glossary of Old English terms, and general background information) became the \\"central source used by graduate students for the study of the poem and by scholars and teachers as the basis of their translations.\\"[56]\\r\\nA great number of translations are available, in poetry and prose. Andy Orchard, in A Critical Companion to Beowulf, lists 33 \\"representative\\" translations in his bibliography,[57] and it has been translated into at least 23 other languages.[58]\\r\\nSeamus Heaney's 1999 translation of the poem (referred to by Howell Chickering and many others as \\"Heaneywulf\\"[59]) was widely publicized. Translating Beowulf is one of the subjects of the 2012 publication Beowulf at Kalamazoo, containing a section with 10 essays on translation, and a section with 22 reviews of Heaney's translation (some of which compare Heaney's work with that of Anglo-Saxon scholar Roy Liuzza).[60] R. D. Fulk, of Indiana University, published the first facing-page edition and translation of the entire manuscript in the Dumbarton Oaks Medieval Library series in 2010.[61]\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien's long-awaited translation (edited by his son, Christopher) was published in 2014 as Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary.[62][63] This also includes Tolkien's own retelling of the story of Beowulf in his tale, Sellic Spell.\\r\\nThe question of whether Beowulf was passed down through oral tradition prior to its present manuscript form has been the subject of much debate, and involves more than simply the issue of its composition. Rather, given the implications of the theory of oral-formulaic composition and oral tradition, the question concerns how the poem is to be understood, and what sorts of interpretations are legitimate.\\r\\nScholarly discussion about Beowulf in the context of the oral tradition was extremely active throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The debate might be framed starkly as follows: on the one hand, we can hypothesise a poem put together from various tales concerning the hero (the Grendel episode, the Grendel's mother story, and the fire drake narrative). These fragments would have been told for many years in tradition, and learned by apprenticeship from one generation of illiterate poets to the next. The poem is composed orally and extemporaneously, and the archive of tradition on which it draws is oral, pagan, Germanic, heroic, and tribal. On the other hand, one might posit a poem which is composed by a literate scribe, who acquired literacy by way of learning Latin (and absorbing Latinate culture and ways of thinking), probably a monk and therefore profoundly Christian in outlook. On this view, the pagan references would be a sort of decorative archaising.[64][65] There is a third view that sees merit in both arguments above and attempts to bridge them, and so cannot be articulated as starkly as they can; it sees more than one Christianity and more than one attitude towards paganism at work in the poem; it sees the poem as initially the product of a literate Christian author with one foot in the pagan world and one in the Christian, himself perhaps a convert (or one whose forebears had been pagan), a poet who was conversant in both oral and literary composition and was capable of a masterful \\"repurposing\\" of poetry from the oral tradition.\\r\\nHowever, scholars such as D.K. Crowne have proposed the idea that the poem was passed down from reciter to reciter under the theory of oral-formulaic composition, which hypothesises that epic poems were (at least to some extent) improvised by whoever was reciting them, and only much later written down. In his landmark work, The Singer of Tales, Albert Lord refers to the work of Francis Peabody Magoun and others, saying \\"the documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally.\\"[66]\\r\\nExamination of Beowulf and other Old English literature for evidence of oral-formulaic composition has met with mixed response. While \\"themes\\" (inherited narrative subunits for representing familiar classes of event, such as the \\"arming the hero\\",[67] or the particularly well-studied \\"hero on the beach\\" theme[68]) do exist across Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic works, some scholars conclude that Anglo-Saxon poetry is a mix of oral-formulaic and literate patterns, arguing that the poems both were composed on a word-by-word basis and followed larger formulae and patterns.[69]\\r\\nLarry Benson argued that the interpretation of Beowulf as an entirely formulaic work diminishes the ability of the reader to analyse the poem in a unified manner, and with due attention to the poet's creativity. Instead, he proposed that other pieces of Germanic literature contain \\"kernels of tradition\\" from which Beowulf borrows and expands upon.[70][71] A few years later, Ann Watts argued against the imperfect application of one theory to two different traditions: traditional, Homeric, oral-formulaic poetry and Anglo-Saxon poetry.[71][72] Thomas Gardner agreed with Watts, arguing that the Beowulf text is of too varied a nature to be completely constructed from set formulae and themes.[71][73]\\r\\nJohn Miles Foley wrote, referring to the Beowulf debate,[74] that while comparative work was both necessary and valid, it must be conducted with a view to the particularities of a given tradition; Foley argued with a view to developments of oral traditional theory that do not assume, or depend upon, ultimately unverifiable assumptions about composition, and instead delineate a more fluid continuum of traditionality and textuality.[75][76][77][67]\\r\\nFinally, in the view of Ursula Schaefer, the question of whether the poem was \\"oral\\" or \\"literate\\" becomes something of a red herring.[78] In this model, the poem is created, and is interpretable, within both noetic horizons. Schaefer's concept of \\"vocality\\" offers neither a compromise nor a synthesis of the views which see the poem as on the one hand Germanic, pagan, and oral and on the other Latin-derived, Christian, and literate, but, as stated by Monika Otter: \\"...?a 'tertium quid', a modality that participates in both oral and literate culture yet also has a logic and aesthetic of its own.\\"[79]\\r\\n|B?dvar Bjarki|Grettir}} Neither identified sources nor analogues for Beowulf can be definitively proven, but many conjectures have been made. These are important in helping historians understand the Beowulf manuscript, as possible source-texts or influences would suggest time-frames of composition, geographic boundaries within which it could be composed, or range (both spatial and temporal) of influence (i.e. when it was \\"popular\\" and where its \\"popularity\\" took it).\\r\\nThere are Scandinavian sources, international folkloric sources, and Celtic sources.[d][80]\\r\\n19th century studies proposed that Beowulf was translated from a lost original Scandinavian work, but this idea was quickly abandoned. But Scandinavian works have continued to be studied as a possible source.[81] Proponents included Gregor Sarrazin?(de) writing in 1886 that an Old Norse original version of Beowulf must have existed,[82] but that view was later debunked by Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) who pointed out that Beowulf is fundamentally Christian and written at a time when any Norse tale would have most likely been pagan.[83]\\r\\nThe epic's possible connection to Grettis saga was made early on by Guebrandur Vigf~sson (1878).[84]\\r\\nGrettis saga is a family saga, and a story about Grettir smundarson?(is), a great-grandson of an Icelandic settler, cannot be comparably as old as Beowulf. Axel Olrik (1903) claimed that on the contrary, this saga was a reworking of Beowulf, and others had followed suit.[82]\\r\\nHowever, Friedrich Panzer?(de) (1910) wrote a thesis in which both Beowulf and Grettis saga drew from a common folkloric source, and this encourage even a detractor such W. W. Lawrence to reposition his view, and entertain the possibility that certain elements in the saga (such as the waterfall in place of the mere) retained an older form.[82]\\r\\nThe viability of this connection has enjoyed enduring support, and was characterized as one of the few Scandinavian analogues to receive a general consensus of potential connection by Theodore M. Andersson?(de) (1998).[85] But that same year, Magn~s Fjalldal published a volume challenging the perception that there is a close parallel, and that tangential similarities were being overemphasized as analogies.[86]\\r\\nAnother candidate for a cogener analogue or possible source is the story of Hrolf kraki and his servant, the legendary bear-shapeshifter Bodvar Bjarki. The story survives in Old Norse Hr܇lfs saga kraka and Saxo's Gesta Danorum. Hrolf kraki, one of the Skj?ldungs, even appears as \\"Hrothulf\\" in the Anglo-Saxon epic. Hence a story about him and his followers may have developed as early as the 6th century.[87]\\r\\nFriedrich Panzer (1910) wrote a thesis that the first part of Beowulf (the Grendel Story) incorporated preexisting folktale material, and that the folktale in question was of the Bear's Son Tale (B?rensohnm?rchen) type, which has surviving examples all over the world.[88][82]\\r\\nThis tale type was later catalogued as international folktale type 301, now formally entitled \\"The Three Stolen Princesses\\" type in Hans Uther's catalogue, although the \\"Bear's Son\\" is still used in Beowulf criticism, if not so much in folkloristic circles.[82]\\r\\nHowever, although this folkloristic approach was seen as a step in the right direction, \\"The Bear's Son\\" tale has later been regarded by many as not a close enough parallel to be a viable choice.[89] Later, Peter J?rgensen, looking for a more concise frame of reference, coined a \\"two-troll tradition\\" that covers both Beowulf and Grettis saga: \\"a Norse 'ecotype' in which a hero enters a cave and kills two giants, usually of different sexes\\";[90] which has emerged as a more attractive folk tale parallel, according to an 1998 assessment by Andersson?(Andersson|de).[91][92]\\r\\nSimilarity of the epic to the Irish folktale of the \\"The Hand and the Child\\" had already been noted by Albert S. Cook (1899), and others even earlier,[e][93][83][f] Swedish folklorist Carl Wilhelm von Sydow?(de) (1914) then made a strong argument for the case of parallelism in \\"The Hand and the Child\\", because the folktale type demonstrated a \\"monstrous arm\\" motif that corresponded with Beowulf wrenching off Grendel's arm. For no such correspondence could be perceived in the Bear's Son Tale or Grettis saga.[g][94][93]\\r\\nJames Carney and Martin Puhvel also agree with this \\"Hand and the Child\\" contextualisation.[h] Puhvel supported the \\"Hand and the Child\\" theory through such motifs as (in Andersson's words) \\"the more powerful giant mother, the mysterious light in the cave, the melting of the sword in blood, the phenomenon of battle rage, swimming prowess, combat with water monsters, underwater adventures, and the bear-hug style of wrestling.\\"[95]\\r\\nAttempts to find classical or Late Latin influence or analogue in Beowulf are almost exclusively linked with Homer's Odyssey or Virgil's Aeneid. In 1926, Albert S. Cook suggested a Homeric connection due to equivalent formulas, metonymies, and analogous voyages.[96] In 1930, James A. Work also supported the Homeric influence, stating that encounter between Beowulf and Unferth was parallel to the encounter between Odysseus and Euryalus in Books 7ÿ8 of the Odyssey, even to the point of both characters giving the hero the same gift of a sword upon being proven wrong in their initial assessment of the hero's prowess. This theory of Homer's influence on Beowulf remained very prevalent in the 1920s, but started to die out in the following decade when a handful of critics stated that the two works were merely \\"comparative literature\\",[97] although Greek was known in late 7th century England: Bede states that Theodore of Tarsus, a Greek, was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, and he taught Greek. Several English scholars and churchmen are described by Bede as being fluent in Greek due to being taught by him; Bede claims to be fluent in Greek himself.[98]\\r\\nFrederick Klaeber, among others, argued for a connection between Beowulf and Virgil near the start of the 20th century, claiming that the very act of writing a secular epic in a Germanic world represents Virgilian influence. Virgil was seen as the pinnacle of Latin literature, and Latin was the dominant literary language of England at the time, therefore making Virgilian influence highly likely.[99] Similarly, in 1971, Alistair Campbell stated that the apologue technique used in Beowulf is so rare in epic poetry aside from Virgil that the poet who composed Beowulf could not have written the poem in such a manner without first coming across Virgil's writings.[100]\\r\\nIt cannot be denied that Biblical parallels occur in the text, whether seen as a pagan work with \\"Christian colouring\\" added by scribes or as a \\"Christian historical novel, with selected bits of paganism deliberately laid on as 'local colour',\\" as Margaret E. Goldsmith did in \\"The Christian Theme of Beowulf,\\".[101] Beowulf channels the Book of Genesis, the Book of Exodus, and the Book of Daniel[102] in its inclusion of references to the Genesis creation narrative, the story of Cain and Abel, Noah and the flood myth, the Devil, Hell, and the Last Judgment.[101]\\r\\nThe poem mixes the West Saxon and Anglian dialects of Old English, though it predominantly uses West Saxon, as do other Old English poems copied at the time.[103]\\r\\nThere is a wide array of linguistic forms in the Beowulf manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that Beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas.[104] The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon.[44]:20ÿ21 There are in Beowulf more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably more than one-third of the total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in Beowulf, and forty of them are poetical words in the sense that they are unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ge- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ge-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-fourth is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.[105]\\r\\nAn Old English poem such as Beowulf is very different from modern poetry. Anglo-Saxon poets typically used alliterative verse, a form of verse in which the first half of the line (the a-verse) is linked to the second half (the b-verse) through similarity in initial sound. In addition, the two halves are divided by a caesura: \\"Oft Scyld Scefing \\\\\\\\ sceatena treatum\\" (l. 4). This verse form maps stressed and unstressed syllables onto abstract entities known as metrical positions. There is no fixed number of beats per line: the first one cited has three (Oft SCYLD SCEFING, with ictus on the suffix -ING) whereas the second has two (SCEAtena TREATum).\\r\\nThe poet has a choice of epithets or formulae to use in order to fulfil the alliteration. When speaking or reading Old English poetry, it is important to remember for alliterative purposes that many of the letters are not pronounced in the same way as in modern English. The letter ?h?, for example, is always pronounced (Hroegar: [?hroegar]), and the digraph ?cg? is pronounced [d?], as in the word edge. Both ?f? and ?s? vary in pronunciation depending on their phonetic environment. Between vowels or voiced consonants, they are voiced, sounding like modern ?v? and ?z?, respectively. Otherwise they are unvoiced, like modern ?f? in fat and ?s? in sat. Some letters which are no longer found in modern English, such as thorn, ?t?, and eth, ?e? ÿ representing both pronunciations of modern English ?th?, as /Ĳ/ in thing and /e/ this ÿ are used extensively both in the original manuscript and in modern English editions. The voicing of these characters echoes that of ?f? and ?s?. Both are voiced (as in this) between other voiced sounds: oeer, latleas, sutern. Otherwise they are unvoiced (as in thing): tunor, sue, sotf?st.\\r\\nKennings are also a significant technique in Beowulf. They are evocative poetic descriptions of everyday things, often created to fill the alliterative requirements of the metre. For example, a poet might call the sea the \\"swan-road\\" or the \\"whale-road\\"; a king might be called a \\"ring-giver.\\" There are many kennings in Beowulf, and the device is typical of much of classic poetry in Old English, which is heavily formulaic. The poem also makes extensive use of elided metaphors.[106]\\r\\nJ. R. R. Tolkien argued in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that the poem is not an epic, and while no conventional term exactly fits, the nearest would be elegy.[107]\\r\\nThe history of modern Beowulf criticism is often said to begin with J. R. R. Tolkien,[108] author and Merton professor of Anglo-Saxon at University of Oxford, who in his 1936 lecture to the British Academy criticised his contemporaries' excessive interest in its historical implications.[109][citation not found] He noted in Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics that as a result the poem's literary value had been largely overlooked and argued that the poem \\"is in fact so interesting as poetry, in places poetry so powerful, that this quite overshadows the historical content...\\"[110]\\r\\nIn historical terms, the poem's characters would have been Norse pagans (the historical events of the poem took place before the Christianisation of Scandinavia), yet the poem was recorded by Christian Anglo-Saxons who had mostly converted from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism around the 7th century ÿ both Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse paganism share a common origin as both are forms of Germanic paganism. Beowulf thus depicts a Germanic warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance.[111]\\r\\nIn terms of the relationship between characters in Beowulf to God, one might recall the substantial amount of paganism that is present throughout the work. Literary critics such as Fred C. Robinson argue that the Beowulf poet arguably tries to send a message to readers during the Anglo-Saxon time period regarding the state of Christianity in their own time. Robinson argues that the intensified religious aspects of the Anglo-Saxon period inherently shape the way in which the Poet alludes to paganism as presented in Beowulf. The Poet arguably calls on Anglo-Saxon readers to recognize the imperfect aspects of their supposed Christian lifestyles. In other words, the Poet is referencing their \\"Anglo-Saxon Heathenism.\\" In terms of the characters of the epic itself, Robinson argues that readers are \\"impressed\\" by the courageous acts of Beowulf and the speeches of Hrothgar (181). But, one is ultimately left to feel sorry for both men as they are fully detached from supposed \\"Christian truth\\" (181). The relationship between the characters of Beowulf, and the otherall message of the Poet, regarding their relationship with God is largely debated among readers and literary critics alike.\\r\\nStanley B. Greenfield has suggested that references to the human body throughout Beowulf emphasise the relative position of thanes to their lord. He argues that the term \\"shoulder-companion\\" could refer to both a physical arm as well as a thane (Aeschere) who was very valuable to his lord (Hrothgar). With Aeschere's death, Hrothgar turns to Beowulf as his new \\"arm.\\"[112] Also, Greenfield argues the foot is used for the opposite effect, only appearing four times in the poem. It is used in conjunction with Unfere (a man described by Beowulf as weak, traitorous, and cowardly). Greenfield notes that Unfere is described as \\"at the king's feet\\" (line 499). Unfere is also a member of the foot troops, who, throughout the story, do nothing and \\"generally serve as backdrops for more heroic action.\\"[113]\\r\\nAt the same time, Richard North argues that the Beowulf poet interpreted \\"Danish myths in Christian form\\" (as the poem would have served as a form of entertainment for a Christian audience), and states: \\"As yet we are no closer to finding out why the first audience of Beowulf liked to hear stories about people routinely classified as damned. This question is pressing, given... that Anglo-Saxons saw the Danes as 'heathens' rather than as foreigners.\\"[114] Grendel's mother and Grendel are described as descendants of Cain, a fact which some scholars link to the Cain tradition.[115]\\r\\nOther scholars disagree, however, as to the meaning and nature of the poem: is it a Christian work set in a Germanic pagan context? The question suggests that the conversion from the Germanic pagan beliefs to Christian ones was a prolonged and gradual process over several centuries, and it remains unclear the ultimate nature of the poem's message in respect to religious belief at the time it was written. Robert F. Yeager notes the facts that form the basis for these questions:\\r\\nThat the scribes of Cotton Vitellius A.XV were Christian beyond doubt, and it is equally sure that Beowulf was composed in a Christianised England since conversion took place in the sixth and seventh centuries. The only Biblical references in Beowulf are to the Old Testament, and Christ is never mentioned. The poem is set in pagan times, and none of the characters is demonstrably Christian. In fact, when we are told what anyone in the poem believes, we learn that they are pagans. Beowulf's own beliefs are not expressed explicitly. He offers eloquent prayers to a higher power, addressing himself to the \\"Father Almighty\\" or the \\"Wielder of All.\\" Were those the prayers of a pagan who used phrases the Christians subsequently appropriated? Or, did the poem's author intend to see Beowulf as a Christian Ur-hero, symbolically refulgent with Christian virtues?[116]\\r\\nThe location of the composition of the poem is also intensely disputed. In 1914, F.W. Moorman, the first professor of English Language at University of Leeds, claimed that Beowulf was composed in Yorkshire,[117] but E. Talbot Donaldson claims that it was probably composed more than twelve hundred years ago, during the first half of the eighth century, and that the writer was a native of what was then called West Mercia, located in the Western Midlands of England. However, the late tenth-century manuscript \\"which alone preserves the poem\\" originated in the kingdom of the West Saxons ÿ as it is more commonly known.[118] Donaldson wrote that \\"the poet who put the materials into their present form was a Christian and?... poem reflects a Christian tradition\\".[119]","input":"How many lines are in the complete manuscript of beowulf?"},{"output":"Melania Trump","context":"First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS)[1] is the informal but accepted title held by the wife of the President of the United States, concurrent with the president's term of office. Although the first ladys role has never been codified or officially defined, she figures prominently in the political and social life of the nation.[2] Melania Trump is the current First Lady.\\r\\nWhile the title was not in general use until much later, Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington, the first U.S. President (1789ÿ1797), is considered to be the inaugural First Lady of the United States. During her lifetime, she was often referred to as \\"Lady Washington\\".[3]\\r\\nSince the 1790s, the role of first lady has changed considerably. It has come to include involvement in political campaigns, management of the White House, championship of social causes, and representation of the president at official and ceremonial occasions. Because first ladies now typically publish their memoirs, which are viewed as potential sources of additional information about their husbands administrations, and because the public is interested in these increasingly independent women in their own right, first ladies frequently remain a focus of attention long after their husbands terms of office have ended.[2] Additionally, over the years individual first ladies have held influence in a range of sectors, from fashion to public opinion on policy. Historically, should a president be unmarried, or a widower, the president usually asks a relative or friend to act as White House hostess.\\r\\nThere are five living former first ladies: Rosalynn Carter, wife of Jimmy Carter; Barbara Bush, wife of George H. W. Bush; Hillary Clinton, wife of Bill Clinton; Laura Bush, wife of George W. Bush; and Michelle Obama, wife of Barack Obama.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of the title First Lady to describe the spouse or hostess of an executive began in the United States. In the early days of the republic, there was not a generally accepted title for the wife of the president. Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as \\"Lady\\", \\"Mrs. President\\", and \\"Mrs. Presidentress\\"; Martha Washington was often referred to as \\"Lady Washington.\\" One of the earliest uses of the term \\"First Lady\\" was applied to her in an 1838 newspaper article that appeared in the St. Johnsbury Caledonian, the author, \\"Mrs. Sigourney\\", discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband George became president, wrote that \\"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion\\".[4]\\r\\nDolley Madison was reportedly referred to as \\"First Lady\\" in 1849 at her funeral in a eulogy delivered by President Zachary Taylor; however, no written record of this eulogy exists, nor did any of the newspapers of her day refer to her by that title.[5] Sometime after 1849, the title began being used in Washington, D.C., social circles. One of the earliest known written examples comes from November 3, 1863, diary entry of William Howard Russell, in which he referred to gossip about \\"the First Lady in the Land,\\" referring to Mary Todd Lincoln. The title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when newspaper journalist Mary C. Ames referred to Lucy Webb Hayes as \\"the First Lady of the Land\\" while reporting on the inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes. The frequent reporting on Lucy Hayes' activities helped spread use of the title outside Washington. A popular 1911 comedic play about Dolley Madison by playwright Charles Nirdlinger, titled The First Lady in the Land, popularized the title further. By the 1930s, it was in wide use. Use of the title later spread from the United States to other nations.\\r\\nWhen Edith Wilson took control of her husband's schedule in 1919 after he had a debilitating stroke, one Republican senator labeled her \\"the Presidentress who had fulfilled the dream of the suffragettes by changing her title from First Lady to Acting First Man.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe wife of the Vice President of the United States is sometimes referred to as the Second Lady of the United States, but this title is much less common.\\r\\nSeveral women (at least thirteen) who were not presidents' wives have served as First Lady, as when the president was a bachelor or widower, or when the wife of the president was unable to fulfill the duties of the First Lady herself. In these cases, the position has been filled by a female relative or friend of the president, such as Martha Jefferson Randolph during Jefferson's presidency, Emily Donelson and Sarah Yorke Jackson during Jackson's, Mary Elizabeth (Taylor) Bliss during Taylor's, Mary Harrison McKee during Benjamin Harrison's presidency, upon her mother's death, Harriet Lane during Buchanan's, and Rose Cleveland prior to Cleveland's marriage.\\r\\nThe position of the First Lady is not an elected one and carries only ceremonial duties. Nonetheless, first ladies have held a highly visible position in American society.[7] The role of the First Lady has evolved over the centuries. She is, first and foremost, the hostess of the White House.[7] She organizes and attends official ceremonies and functions of state either along with, or in place of, the president. Lisa Burns identifies four successive main themes of the first ladyship: as public woman (1900ÿ1929); as political celebrity (1932ÿ1961); as political activist (1964ÿ1977); and as political interloper (1980ÿ2001).[8]\\r\\nMartha Washington created the role and hosted many affairs of state at the national capital (New York and Philadelphia). This socializing became known as \\"the Republican Court\\" and provided elite women with an opportunity to play backstage political role.[9] Both Martha Washington and Abigail Adams were treated as if they were \\"ladies\\" of the British royal court.[7]\\r\\nDolley Madison popularized the First Ladyship by engaging in efforts to assist orphans and women, by dressing in elegant fashions and attracting newspaper coverage, and by risking her life to save iconic treasures during the War of 1812. Madison set the standard for the ladyship and her actions were the model for nearly every First Lady until Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s.[7] She traveled widely and spoke to many groups, often voicing personal opinions to the left of the president's. She authored a weekly newspaper column and hosted a radio show.[10] Jacqueline Kennedy led an effort to redecorate and restore the White House.[11]\\r\\nMany first ladies became significant fashion trendsetters.[7] Some have exercised a degree of political influence by virtue of being an important adviser to the president.[7]\\r\\nOver the course of the 20th century, it became increasingly common for first ladies to select specific causes to promote, usually ones that are not politically divisive. It is common for the First Lady to hire a staff to support these activities. Lady Bird Johnson pioneered environmental protection and beautification.[12] Pat Nixon encouraged volunteerism and traveled extensively abroad; Betty Ford supported women's rights; Rosalynn Carter aided those with mental disabilities; Nancy Reagan founded the Just Say No drug awareness campaign; Barbara Bush promoted literacy; Hillary Clinton sought to reform the healthcare system in the U.S.; Laura Bush supported women's rights groups, and encouraged childhood literacy.[7] Michelle Obama has become identified with supporting military families and tackling childhood obesity.[13]\\r\\nNear the end of her husband's presidency, Clinton became the first First Lady to run for political office. During the campaign, her daughter, Chelsea, took over much of the First Lady's role. Victorious, Clinton served as U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, when she resigned in order to become President Obama's Secretary of State. Clinton was the Democratic Party nominee for President in the 2016 election.\\r\\nThe Office of the First Lady of the United States is accountable to the First Lady for her to carry out her duties as hostess of the White House, and is also in charge of all social and ceremonial events of the White House. The First Lady has her own staff that includes a chief of staff, press secretary, White House Social Secretary, Chief Floral Designer, etc. The Office of the First Lady is an entity of the White House Office, a branch of the Executive Office of the President.[14] When First Lady Hillary Clinton decided to pursue a run for Senator of New York, she set aside her duties as first lady[15] and moved to Chappaqua, New York to establish state residency.[16] She resumed her duties as First Lady after winning her senatorial campaign,[17] and retained her duties as both first lady and U.S. Senator for the seventeen-day overlap before Bill Clinton's term came to an end.[18]\\r\\nDespite the significant responsibilities usually handled by the First Lady, the First Lady does not receive a salary. This has been criticized by both Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama.[19]\\r\\nEstablished in 1912, the First Ladies Collection has been one of the most popular attractions at the Smithsonian Institution. The original exhibition opened in 1914 and was one of the first at the Smithsonian to prominently feature women. Originally focused largely on fashion, the exhibition now delves deeper into the contributions of first ladies to the presidency and American society. In 2008, \\"First Ladies at the Smithsonian\\" opened at the National Museum of American History as part of its reopening year celebration. That exhibition served as a bridge to the museum's expanded exhibition on first ladies' history that opened on November 19, 2011. \\"The First Ladies\\" explores the unofficial but important position of first lady and the ways that different women have shaped the role to make their own contributions to the presidential administrations and the nation. The exhibition features 26 dresses and more than 160 other objects, ranging from those of Martha Washington to Michelle Obama, and includes White House china, personal possessions and other objects from the Smithsonian's unique collection of first ladies' materials.[20]\\r\\nSome first ladies have garnered attention for their dress and style. Jacqueline Kennedy, for instance, became a global fashion icon: her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and imitated by many young women, and she was named to the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame in 1965.[21][22] Michelle Obama has also received significant attention for her fashion choices: style writer Robin Givhan praised her in The Daily Beast, arguing that the First Lady's style has helped to enhance the public image of the office.[23]\\r\\nAs of October 2017, there are five living former First Ladies, as seen below.\\r\\nRosalynn Carter\\r\\nserved 1977ÿ81\\r\\nborn 1927 (age 90)\\r\\nwife of Jimmy Carter\\r\\nBarbara Bush\\r\\nserved 1989ÿ93\\r\\nborn 1925 (age 92)\\r\\nwife of George H.

Her Stuart descendants Mary II and Anne were both of comparable height.\\r\\nThe shortest British monarch (not counting those who acceded as minors) was most likely Queen Victoria, who stood only 5' (1.52?m) when in her 30s, and was possibly an inch or two shorter towards the end of her life.","input":"Who is the shortest-reigning monarch in british history?"},{"output":"Champ de Mars","context":"The Eiffel Tower (/?a?f?l ?ta?.?r/ EYE-f?l TOW-?r; French: tour Eiffel, pronounced?[tu???f?l] ?listen) is a wrought iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.\\r\\nConstructed from 1887ÿ89 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world; 6.91?million people ascended it in 2015.\\r\\nThe tower is 324 metres (1,063?ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410?ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17?ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second-tallest structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.\\r\\nThe tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276?m (906?ft) above the ground ÿ the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift (elevator) to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to the second. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design of the Eiffel Tower was the product of Maurice Koechlin and mile Nouguier, two senior engineers working for the Compagnie des tablissements Eiffel, after discussion about a suitable centrepiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \\"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\\".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\\r\\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Socit des Ingnieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise,\\r\\nNot only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.[6]\\r\\nLittle progress was made until 1886, when Jules Grvy was re-elected as president of France and douard Lockroy was appointed as minister for trade. A budget for the exposition was passed and, on 1 May, Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition, which effectively made the selection of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion, as entries had to include a study for a 300?m (980?ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars.[6] (A 300-meter tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort). On 12 May, a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals, which, a month later, decided that all the proposals except Eiffel's were either impractical or lacking in details.\\r\\nAfter some debate about the exact location of the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him 1.5 million francs toward the construction costs: less than a quarter of the estimated 6.5 million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next 20 years. He later established a separate company to manage the tower, putting up half the necessary capital himself.[7]\\r\\nThe proposed tower had been a subject of controversy, drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds. These objections were an expression of a long-standing debate in France about the relationship between architecture and engineering. It came to a head as work began at the Champ de Mars: a \\"Committee of Three Hundred\\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by the prominent architect Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts, such as Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet. A petition called \\"Artists against the Eiffel Tower\\" was sent to the Minister of Works and Commissioner for the Exposition, Charles Alphand, and it was published by Le Temps on 14 February 1887:\\r\\nWe, writers, painters, sculptors, architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of Paris, protest with all our strength, with all our indignation in the name of slighted French taste, against the erection  of this useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower  To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years  we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal.[8]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the Egyptian pyramids: \\"My tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man. Will it not also be grandiose in its way? And why would something admirable in Egypt become hideous and ridiculous in Paris?\\"[9] These criticisms were also dealt with by douard Lockroy in a letter of support written to Alphand, ironically saying,[10] \\"Judging by the stately swell of the rhythms, the beauty of the metaphors, the elegance of its delicate and precise style, one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time\\", and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before, and construction on the tower was already under way.\\r\\nIndeed, Garnier was a member of the Tower Commission that had examined the various proposals, and had raised no objection. Eiffel was similarly unworried, pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings, that the Champ de Mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them, and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower: \\"Do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony?\\"[11]\\r\\nSome of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built; others remained unconvinced.[12] Guy de Maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower's restaurant every day because it was the one place in Paris where the tower was not visible.[13]\\r\\nBy 1918, it had become a symbol of Paris and of France after Guillaume Apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower (a calligram) to express his feelings about the war against Germany.[14] Today, it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art, and is often featured in films and literature.\\r\\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[15] Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four 2?m (6.6?ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15?m (49?ft) long and 6?m (20?ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22?m (72?ft)[16] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6?m (20?ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork.\\r\\nEach shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10?cm (4?in) in diameter and 7.5?m (25?ft) long. The foundations were completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the 18,038 different parts needed.[17] The task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified to within 0.1?mm (0.0039?in) and angles worked out to one second of arc. The finished components, some already riveted together into sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038 pieces were joined together using 2.5?million rivets.[15]\\r\\nAt first the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to the first level, construction was paused in order to create a substantial timber scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower, and sensational headlines such as \\"Eiffel Suicide!\\" and \\"Gustave Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum\\" appeared in the tabloid press.[18] At this stage, a small \\"creeper\\" crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of March 1888.[15] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small adjustments in order to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800 tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[15] only one person died thanks to Eiffel's stringent safety precautions and the use of movable gangways, guardrails and screens.\\r\\nThe start of the erection of the metalwork.\\r\\n7 December 1887: Construction of the legs with scaffolding.\\r\\n20 March 1888: Completion of the first level.\\r\\n15 May 1888: Start of construction on the second stage.\\r\\n21 August 1888: Completion of the second level.\\r\\n26 December 1888: Construction of the upper stage.\\r\\n15 March 1889: Construction of the cupola.\\r\\nEquipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the Exposition. Although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level, or even the second, lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent.[19]\\r\\nConstructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward: the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track, and a contract was given to the French company Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs.[20] Roux, Combaluzier & Lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid, articulated links to which the car was attached. Lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car's weight. The car was pushed up from below, not pulled up from above: to prevent the chain buckling, it was enclosed in a conduit. At the bottom of the run, the chains passed around 3.9?m (12?ft 10?in) diameter sprockets. Smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains.[20]\\r\\nInstalling lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible. No French company wanted to undertake the work. The European branch of Otis Brothers & Company submitted a proposal but this was rejected: the fair's charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower. The deadline for bids was extended but still no French companies put themselves forward, and eventually the contract was given to Otis in July 1887.[21] Otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs.\\r\\nThe car was divided into two superimposed compartments, each holding 25 passengers, with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level. Motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram 12.67?m (41?ft 7?in) long and 96.5?cm (38.0?in) in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of 10.83?m (35?ft 6?in): this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves. Five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg, producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse, multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated. The hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level. After being exhausted from the cylinder, the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg. This reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level.\\r\\nThe original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by Lon Edoux. A pair of 81?m (266?ft) hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level, reaching nearly halfway up to the third level. One lift car was mounted on top of these rams: cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car. Each car only travelled half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway. The 10-ton cars each held 65 passengers.[22]\\r\\nThe main structural work was completed at the end of March 1889 and, on 31 March, Eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials, accompanied by representatives of the press, to the top of the tower.[12] Because the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, with Eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including the structural engineer, mile Nouguier, the head of construction, Jean Compagnon, the President of the City Council, and reporters from Le Figaro and Le Monde Illustr, completed the ascent. At 2:35?pm, Eiffel hoisted a large Tricolour to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired at the first level.[23]\\r\\nThere was still work to be done, particularly on the lifts and facilities, and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on 6 May; even then, the lifts had not been completed. The tower was an instant success with the public, and nearly 30,000 visitors made the 1,710-step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on 26 May.[24] Tickets cost 2 francs for the first level, 3 for the second, and 5 for the top, with half-price admission on Sundays,[25] and by the end of the exhibition there had been 1,896,987 visitors.[3]\\r\\nAfter dark, the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps, and a beacon sent out three beams of red, white and blue light. Two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition. The daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top.\\r\\nOn the second level, the French newspaper Le Figaro had an office and a printing press, where a special souvenir edition, Le Figaro de la Tour, was made. There was also a patisserie.\\r\\nAt the top, there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit. Graffitists were also catered for: sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower. Gustave Eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse (\\"truly curious\\").[26]\\r\\nFamous visitors to the tower included the Prince of Wales, Sarah Bernhardt, \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody (his Wild West show was an attraction at the exposition) and Thomas Edison.[24] Eiffel invited Edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower, where Edison presented him with one of his phonographs, a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition.[27] Edison signed the guestbook with this message:\\r\\nTo M Eiffel the Engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern Engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all Engineers including the Great Engineer the Bon Dieu, Thomas Edison.\\r\\nEiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for 20 years. It was to be dismantled in 1909, when its ownership would revert to the City of Paris. The City had planned to tear it down (part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle) but as the tower proved to be valuable for communication purposes, it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit.\\r\\nEiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations, and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies.[28]\\r\\nFor the 1900 Exposition Universelle, the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the French firm Fives-Lille. These had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level, and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism to the Otis lifts, although this was situated at the base of the tower. Hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism.[21] At the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level. The layout of both first and second levels was modified, with the space available for visitors on the second level. The original lift in the south pillar was removed 13 years later.\\r\\nOn 19 October 1901, Alberto Santos-Dumont, flying his No.6 airship, won a 100,000-franc prize offered by Henri Deutsch de la Meurthe for the first person to make a flight from St. Cloud to the Eiffel Tower and back in less than half an hour.[29]\\r\\nMany innovations took place at the Eiffel Tower in the early 20th century. In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected, incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[30] Just two years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 metres) to demonstrate his parachute design.[31] In 1914, at the outbreak of World War?I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[32] From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citro?n adorned three of the tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time.[citation needed] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was installed.[33]\\r\\nOn two separate but related occasions in 1925, the con artist Victor Lustig \\"sold\\" the tower for scrap metal.[34] A year later, in February 1926, pilot Leon Collet was killed trying to fly under the tower. His aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station.[35] A bust of Gustave Eiffel by Antoine Bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on 2 May 1929.[36] In 1930, the tower lost the title of the world's tallest structure when the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed.[37] In 1938, the decorative arcade around the first level was removed.[38]\\r\\nUpon the German occupation of Paris in 1940, the lift cables were cut by the French. The tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until 1946.[39] In 1940, German soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika-centered Reichskriegsflagge,[40] but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later, and was replaced by a smaller one.[41] When visiting Paris, Hitler chose to stay on the ground. When the Allies were nearing Paris in August 1944, Hitler ordered General Dietrich von Choltitz, the military governor of Paris, to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city. Von Choltitz disobeyed the order.[42] On 25 June, before the Germans had been driven out of Paris, the German flag was replaced with a Tricolour by two men from the French Naval Museum, who narrowly beat three men led by Lucien Sarniguet, who had lowered the Tricolour on 13 June 1940 when Paris fell to the Germans.[39]\\r\\nA fire started in the television transmitter on 3 January 1956, damaging the top of the tower. Repairs took a year, and in 1957, the present radio aerial was added to the top.[43] In 1964, the Eiffel Tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the Minister of Cultural Affairs, Andr Malraux.[44] A year later, an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar.[45]\\r\\nAccording to interviews, in 1967, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with Charles de Gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to Montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during Expo 67. The plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the French government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location.[46]\\r\\nIn 1982, the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after 97 years in service. These had been closed to the public between November and March because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze. The new cars operate in pairs, with one counterbalancing the other, and perform the journey in one stage, reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes. At the same time, two new emergency staircases were installed, replacing the original spiral staircases. In 1983, the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven Otis lift to serve the Jules Verne restaurant.[citation needed] The Fives-Lille lifts in the east and west legs, fitted in 1899, were extensively refurbished in 1986. The cars were replaced, and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts. The motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil-filled hydraulic system, and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system.[45] A service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later.\\r\\nRobert Moriarty flew a Beechcraft Bonanza under the tower on 31 March 1984.[47] In 1987, A.J. Hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the Eiffel Tower, using a special cord he had helped develop. Hackett was arrested by the police.[48] On 27 October 1991, Thierry Devaux, along with mountain guide Herv Calvayrac, performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower.[49] Facing the Champ de Mars, Devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor. When firemen arrived, he stopped after the sixth jump.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor its \\"Countdown to the Year 2000\\" celebration on 31 December 1999, flashing lights and high-powered searchlights were installed on the tower. Fireworks were set off all over it. An exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event. The searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in Paris's night sky, and 20,000 flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour.[50]\\r\\nThe lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium On 31 December 2000. The sparkly lighting continued for 18 months until July 2001. The sparkling lights were turned on again on 21 June 2003, and the display was planned to last for 10 years before they needed replacing.[51]\\r\\nThe tower received its 200,000,000th guest on 28 November 2002.[52] The tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about 7?million visitors since 2003.[53] In 2004, the Eiffel Tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level.[54] A glass floor was installed on the first level during the 2014 refurbishment.[55]\\r\\nThe puddled iron (wrought iron) of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons,[56] and the addition of lifts, shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately 10,100?tons.[57] As a demonstration of the economy of design, if the 7,300?tons of metal in the structure were melted down, it would fill the square base, 125 metres (410?ft) on each side, to a depth of only 6.25?cm (2.46?in) assuming the density of the metal to be 7.8?tons per cubic metre.[58] Additionally, a cubic box surrounding the tower (324?m x 125?m x 125?m) would contain 6,200?tons of air, weighing almost as much as the iron itself. Depending on the ambient temperature, the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to 18?cm (7?in) due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun.[59]\\r\\nWhen it was built, many were shocked by the tower's daring form. Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team ÿ experienced bridge builders ÿ understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them. In an interview with the newspaper Le Temps published on 14 February 1887, Eiffel said:\\r\\nIs it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony?  Now to what phenomenon did I have to give primary concern in designing the Tower? It was wind resistance. Well then! I hold that the curvature of the monument's four outer edges, which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be  will give a great impression of strength and beauty, for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole.[60]\\r\\nHe used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind, rather than a mathematical formula. Close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape.[61] All parts of the tower were over-designed to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces. The top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework.[62] In the years since it was completed, engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design. The most recent, devised in 2004 after letters sent by Eiffel to the French Society of Civil Engineers in 1885 were translated into English, is described as a non-linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point.[61]\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower sways by up to 9?centimetres (3.5?in) in the wind.[63]\\r\\nWhen originally built, the first level contained three restaurantsone French, one Russian and one Flemishand an \\"Anglo-American Bar\\". After the exposition closed, the Flemish restaurant was converted to a 250-seat theatre. A promenade 2.6-metre (8?ft 6?in) wide ran around the outside of the first level. At the top, there were laboratories for various experiments, and a small apartment reserved for Gustave Eiffel to entertain guests, which is now open to the public, complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of Eiffel and some of his notable guests.[64]\\r\\nIn May 2016, an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament in Paris in June. The apartment has a kitchen, two bedrooms, a lounge, and views of Paris landmarks including the Seine, the Sacre Coeur, and the Arc de Triomphe.[65]\\r\\nThe arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower's history. Given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings, each lift, in normal service, takes an average of 8 minutes and 50 seconds to do the round trip, spending an average of 1 minute and 15 seconds at each level. The average journey time between levels is 1 minute. The original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs. Because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance, public access is often restricted. The rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift.[citation needed]\\r\\nGustave Eiffel engraved on the tower the names of 72 French scientists, engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower. Eiffel chose this \\"invocation of science\\" because of his concern over the artists' protest. At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986ÿ87 by the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, a company operating the tower.[66]\\r\\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to perfectly complement the Parisian sky.[67] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \\"Eiffel Tower Brown\\".[68]\\r\\nThe only non-structural elements are the four decorative grill-work arches, added in Sauvestre's sketches, which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition.[69]\\r\\nOne of the great Hollywood movie clichs is that the view from a Parisian window always includes the tower. In reality, since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in Paris to seven storeys, only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower.[citation needed]\\r\\nMaintenance of the tower includes applying 60?tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting. The tower has been completely repainted at least 19 times since it was built. Lead paint was still being used as recently as 2001 when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment.[51]\\r\\nThe nearest Paris Mtro station is Bir-Hakeim and the nearest RER station is Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel.[70] The tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai Branly and the Pont d'Ina.\\r\\nMore than 250?million people have visited the tower since it was completed in 1889.[3] In 2015, there were 6.91?million visitors.[71] The tower is the most-visited paid monument in the world.[72] An average of 25,000 people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues.[73] Tickets can be purchased online to avoid the long queues.\\r\\nThe tower has two restaurants: Le 58 Tour Eiffel on the first level, and Le Jules Verne, a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level. This restaurant has one star in the Michelin Red Guide. It is run by the multi-Michelin star chef Alain Ducasse[74] and owes its name to the famous science-fiction writer Jules Verne. Additionally, there is a champagne bar at the top of the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nAs one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, the Eiffel Tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers. An early example is Blackpool Tower in England. The mayor of Blackpool, Sir John Bickerstaffe, was so impressed on seeing the Eiffel Tower at the 1889 exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town. It opened in 1894 and is 158.1?metres (518?ft) tall.[75] Tokyo Tower in Japan, built as a communications tower in 1958, was also inspired by the Eiffel Tower.[76]\\r\\nThere are various scale models of the tower in the United States, including a half-scale version at the Paris Las Vegas, Nevada, one in Paris, Texas built in 1993, and two 1:3 scale models at Kings Island, Ohio, and Kings Dominion, Virginia, amusement parks opened in 1972 and 1975 respectively. Two 1:3 scale models can be found in China, one in Durango, Mexico that was donated by the local French community, and several across Europe.[77]\\r\\nIn 2011, the TV show Pricing the Priceless on the National Geographic Channel speculated that a full-size replica of the tower would cost approximately US$480?million to build.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the 20th century. Until the 1950s, sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the Avenue de Suffren and Champ de Mars. These were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers. In 1909, a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar, which still exists today. On 20 November 1913, the Paris Observatory, using the Eiffel Tower as an aerial, exchanged wireless signals with the United States Naval Observatory, which used an aerial in Arlington, Virginia. The object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between Paris and Washington, D.C.[79] Today, radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the Eiffel Tower.\\r\\nA television antenna was first installed on the tower in 1957, increasing its height by 18.7?m (61.4?ft). Work carried out in 2000 added a further 5.3?m (17.4?ft), giving the current height of 324?m (1,063?ft).[51] Analogue television signals from the Eiffel Tower ceased on 8 March 2011.\\r\\nThe tower and its image have long been in the public domain.[80] In June 1990 a French court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in 1989 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary was an \\"original visual creation\\" protected by copyright. The Court of Cassation, France's judicial court of last resort, upheld the ruling in March 1992.[81] The Socit d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright.[82] As a result, the SNTE alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in France and some other countries for commercial use.[83][84]\\r\\nThe imposition of copyright has been controversial. The Director of Documentation for what was then called the Socit Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SNTE), Stphane Dieu, commented in 2005: \\"It is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image, so that it isn't used in ways [of which] we don't approve\\".[85] SNTE made over ?1?million from copyright fees in 2002.[86] However, it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night, as well as hindering non-profit and semi-commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower.[80]\\r\\nFrench doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented,[87] a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule. Therefore, SETE may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of Paris which happen to include the lit tower.\\r\\nThe Eiffel Tower was the world's tallest structure when completed in 1889, a distinction it retained until 1929 when the Chrysler Building in New York City was topped out.[88] The tower has lost its standing both as the world's tallest structure and the world's tallest lattice tower but retains its status as the tallest freestanding (non-guyed) structure in France.","input":"What area of paris is the eiffel tower?"},{"output":"Basalt","context":"Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, is one of the three main rock types, the others being sedimentary and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as extrusive rocks. Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, or without crystallization to form natural glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIgneous and metamorphic rocks make up 90ÿ95% of the top 16?km of the Earth's crust by volume.[1] Igneous rocks form about 15% of the Earth's current land surface.[note 1] Most of the Earth's oceanic crust is made of igneous rock.\\r\\nIgneous rocks are also geologically important because:\\r\\nIn terms of modes of occurrence, igneous rocks can be either intrusive (plutonic and hypabyssal) or extrusive (volcanic).\\r\\nIntrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of a planet, surrounded by pre-existing rock (called country rock); the magma cools slowly and, as a result, these rocks are coarse-grained. The mineral grains in such rocks can generally be identified with the naked eye. Intrusive rocks can also be classified according to the shape and size of the intrusive body and its relation to the other formations into which it intrudes. Typical intrusive formations are batholiths, stocks, laccoliths, sills and dikes. When the magma solidifies within the earth's crust, it cools slowly forming coarse textured rocks, such as granite, gabbro, or diorite.\\r\\nThe central cores of major mountain ranges consist of intrusive igneous rocks, usually granite. When exposed by erosion, these cores (called batholiths) may occupy huge areas of the Earth's surface.\\r\\nIntrusive igneous rocks that form at depth within the crust are termed plutonic (or abyssal) rocks and are usually coarse-grained. Intrusive igneous rocks that form near the surface are termed subvolcanic or hypabyssal rocks and they are usually medium-grained. Hypabyssal rocks are less common than plutonic or volcanic rocks and often form dikes, sills, laccoliths, lopoliths, or phacoliths.\\r\\nExtrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks, are formed at the crust's surface as a result of the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. Extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common extrusive igneous rock and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.\\r\\nThe molten rock, with or without suspended crystals and gas bubbles, is called magma. It rises because it is less dense than the rock from which it was created. When magma reaches the surface from beneath water or air, it is called lava. Eruptions of volcanoes into air are termed subaerial, whereas those occurring underneath the ocean are termed submarine. Black smokers and mid-ocean ridge basalt are examples of submarine volcanic activity.\\r\\nThe volume of extrusive rock erupted annually by volcanoes varies with plate tectonic setting. Extrusive rock is produced in the following proportions:[3]\\r\\nMagma that erupts from a volcano behaves according to its viscosity, determined by temperature, composition, crystal content and the amount of silica. High-temperature magma, most of which is basaltic in composition, behaves in a manner similar to thick oil and, as it cools, treacle. Long, thin basalt flows with pahoehoe surfaces are common. Intermediate composition magma, such as andesite, tends to form cinder cones of intermingled ash, tuff and lava, and may have a viscosity similar to thick, cold molasses or even rubber when erupted. Felsic magma, such as rhyolite, is usually erupted at low temperature and is up to 10,000 times as viscous as basalt. Volcanoes with rhyolitic magma commonly erupt explosively, and rhyolitic lava flows are typically of limited extent and have steep margins, because the magma is so viscous.\\r\\nFelsic and intermediate magmas that erupt often do so violently, with explosions driven by the release of dissolved gasestypically water vapour, but also carbon dioxide. Explosively erupted pyroclastic material is called tephra and includes tuff, agglomerate and ignimbrite. Fine volcanic ash is also erupted and forms ash tuff deposits, which can often cover vast areas.\\r\\nBecause lava usually cools and crystallizes rapidly, it is usually fine-grained. If the cooling has been so rapid as to prevent the formation of even small crystals after extrusion, the resulting rock may be mostly glass (such as the rock obsidian). If the cooling of the lava happened more slowly, the rock would be coarse-grained.\\r\\nBecause the minerals are mostly fine-grained, it is much more difficult to distinguish between the different types of extrusive igneous rocks than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained extrusive igneous rocks can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.\\r\\nIgneous rocks are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, mineralogy, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.\\r\\nThe classification of the many types of different igneous rocks can provide us with important information about the conditions under which they formed. Two important variables used for the classification of igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.\\r\\nIn a simplified classification, igneous rock types are separated on the basis of the type of feldspar present, the presence or absence of quartz, and in rocks with no feldspar or quartz, the type of iron or magnesium minerals present. Rocks containing quartz (silica in composition) are silica-oversaturated. Rocks with feldspathoids are silica-undersaturated, because feldspathoids cannot coexist in a stable association with quartz.\\r\\nIgneous rocks that have crystals large enough to be seen by the naked eye are called phaneritic; those with crystals too small to be seen are called aphanitic. Generally speaking, phaneritic implies an intrusive origin; aphanitic an extrusive one.\\r\\nAn igneous rock with larger, clearly discernible crystals embedded in a finer-grained matrix is termed porphyry. Porphyritic texture develops when some of the crystals grow to considerable size before the main mass of the magma crystallizes as finer-grained, uniform material.\\r\\nIgneous rocks are classified on the basis of texture and composition. Texture refers to the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or crystals of which the rock is composed.\\r\\nTexture is an important criterion for the naming of volcanic rocks. The texture of volcanic rocks, including the size, shape, orientation, and distribution of mineral grains and the intergrain relationships, will determine whether the rock is termed a tuff, a pyroclastic lava or a simple lava.\\r\\nHowever, the texture is only a subordinate part of classifying volcanic rocks, as most often there needs to be chemical information gleaned from rocks with extremely fine-grained groundmass or from airfall tuffs, which may be formed from volcanic ash.\\r\\nTextural criteria are less critical in classifying intrusive rocks where the majority of minerals will be visible to the naked eye or at least using a hand lens, magnifying glass or microscope. Plutonic rocks also tend to be less texturally varied and less prone to gaining structural fabrics. Textural terms can be used to differentiate different intrusive phases of large plutons, for instance porphyritic margins to large intrusive bodies, porphyry stocks and subvolcanic dikes (apophyses). Mineralogical classification is most often used to classify plutonic rocks. Chemical classifications are preferred to classify volcanic rocks, with phenocryst species used as a prefix, e.g. \\"olivine-bearing picrite\\" or \\"orthoclase-phyric rhyolite\\".\\r\\nIgneous rocks can be classified according to chemical or mineralogical parameters.\\r\\nChemical: total alkali-silica content (TAS diagram) for volcanic rock classification used when modal or mineralogic data is unavailable:\\r\\nChemical classification also extends to differentiating rocks that are chemically similar according to the TAS diagram, for instance:\\r\\nAn idealized mineralogy (the normative mineralogy) can be calculated from the chemical composition, and the calculation is useful for rocks too fine-grained or too altered for identification of minerals that crystallized from the melt. For instance, normative quartz classifies a rock as silica-oversaturated; an example is rhyolite. In an older terminology, silica oversaturated rocks were called silicic or acidic where the SiO2 was greater than 66% and the family term quartzolite was applied to the most silicic. A normative feldspathoid classifies a rock as silica-undersaturated; an example is nephelinite.\\r\\nIn 1902, a group of American petrographers proposed that all existing classifications of igneous rocks should be discarded and replaced by a \\"quantitative\\" classification based on chemical analysis. They showed how vague, and often unscientific, much of the existing terminology was and argued that as the chemical composition of an igneous rock was its most fundamental characteristic, it should be elevated to prime position.\\r\\nGeological occurrence, structure, mineralogical constitutionthe hitherto accepted criteria for the discrimination of rock specieswere relegated to the background. The completed rock analysis is first to be interpreted in terms of the rock-forming minerals which might be expected to be formed when the magma crystallizes, e.g., quartz feldspars, olivine, akermannite, Feldspathoids, magnetite, corundum, and so on, and the rocks are divided into groups strictly according to the relative proportion of these minerals to one another.[5][6]\\r\\nFor volcanic rocks, mineralogy is important in classifying and naming lavas. The most important criterion is the phenocryst species, followed by the groundmass mineralogy. Often, where the groundmass is aphanitic, chemical classification must be used to properly identify a volcanic rock.\\r\\nMineralogic contents ÿ felsic versus mafic\\r\\nFor intrusive, plutonic and usually phaneritic igneous rocks (where all minerals are visible at least via microscope), the mineralogy is used to classify the rock. This usually occurs on ternary diagrams, where the relative proportions of three minerals are used to classify the rock.\\r\\nThe following table is a simple subdivision of igneous rocks according to both their composition and mode of occurrence.\\r\\nFor a more detailed classification see QAPF diagram.\\r\\nGranite is an igneous intrusive rock (crystallized at depth), with felsic composition (rich in silica and predominately quartz plus potassium-rich feldspar plus sodium-rich plagioclase) and phaneritic, subeuhedral texture (minerals are visible to the unaided eye and commonly some of them retain original crystallographic shapes).\\r\\nThe Earth's crust averages about 35 kilometers thick under the continents, but averages only some 7ÿ10 kilometers beneath the oceans. The continental crust is composed primarily of sedimentary rocks resting on a crystalline basement formed of a great variety of metamorphic and igneous rocks, including granulite and granite. Oceanic crust is composed primarily of basalt and gabbro. Both continental and oceanic crust rest on peridotite of the mantle.\\r\\nRocks may melt in response to a decrease in pressure, to a change in composition (such as an addition of water), to an increase in temperature, or to a combination of these processes.\\r\\nOther mechanisms, such as melting from a meteorite impact, are less important today, but impacts during the accretion of the Earth led to extensive melting, and the outer several hundred kilometers of our early Earth was probably an ocean of magma. Impacts of large meteorites in the last few hundred million years have been proposed as one mechanism responsible for the extensive basalt magmatism of several large igneous provinces.\\r\\nDecompression melting occurs because of a decrease in pressure.[7]\\r\\nThe solidus temperatures of most rocks (the temperatures below which they are completely solid) increase with increasing pressure in the absence of water. Peridotite at depth in the Earth's mantle may be hotter than its solidus temperature at some shallower level. If such rock rises during the convection of solid mantle, it will cool slightly as it expands in an adiabatic process, but the cooling is only about 0.3?C per kilometer. Experimental studies of appropriate peridotite samples document that the solidus temperatures increase by 3?C to 4?C per kilometer. If the rock rises far enough, it will begin to melt. Melt droplets can coalesce into larger volumes and be intruded upwards. This process of melting from the upward movement of solid mantle is critical in the evolution of the Earth.\\r\\nDecompression melting creates the ocean crust at mid-ocean ridges. It also causes volcanism in intraplate regions, such as Europe, Africa and the Pacific sea floor. There, it is variously attributed either to the rise of mantle plumes (the \\"Plume hypothesis\\") or to intraplate extension (the \\"Plate hypothesis\\").[8]\\r\\nThe change of rock composition most responsible for the creation of magma is the addition of water. Water lowers the solidus temperature of rocks at a given pressure. For example, at a depth of about 100 kilometers, peridotite begins to melt near 800?C in the presence of excess water, but near or above about 1,500?C in the absence of water.[9] Water is driven out of the oceanic lithosphere in subduction zones, and it causes melting in the overlying mantle. Hydrous magmas composed of basalt and andesite are produced directly and indirectly as results of dehydration during the subduction process. Such magmas, and those derived from them, build up island arcs such as those in the Pacific Ring of Fire. These magmas form rocks of the calc-alkaline series, an important part of the continental crust.\\r\\nThe addition of carbon dioxide is relatively a much less important cause of magma formation than the addition of water, but genesis of some silica-undersaturated magmas has been attributed to the dominance of carbon dioxide over water in their mantle source regions. In the presence of carbon dioxide, experiments document that the peridotite solidus temperature decreases by about 200?C in a narrow pressure interval at pressures corresponding to a depth of about 70?km. At greater depths, carbon dioxide can have more effect: at depths to about 200?km, the temperatures of initial melting of a carbonated peridotite composition were determined to be 450?C to 600?C lower than for the same composition with no carbon dioxide.[10] Magmas of rock types such as nephelinite, carbonatite, and kimberlite are among those that may be generated following an influx of carbon dioxide into mantle at depths greater than about 70?km.\\r\\nIncrease in temperature is the most typical mechanism for formation of magma within continental crust. Such temperature increases can occur because of the upward intrusion of magma from the mantle. Temperatures can also exceed the solidus of a crustal rock in continental crust thickened by compression at a plate boundary. The plate boundary between the Indian and Asian continental masses provides a well-studied example, as the Tibetan Plateau just north of the boundary has crust about 80 kilometers thick, roughly twice the thickness of normal continental crust. Studies of electrical resistivity deduced from magnetotelluric data have detected a layer that appears to contain silicate melt and that stretches for at least 1,000 kilometers within the middle crust along the southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.[11] Granite and rhyolite are types of igneous rock commonly interpreted as products of the melting of continental crust because of increases in temperature. Temperature increases also may contribute to the melting of lithosphere dragged down in a subduction zone.\\r\\nMost magmas only entirely melt for small parts of their histories. More typically, they are mixes of melt and crystals, and sometimes also of gas bubbles. Melt, crystals, and bubbles usually have different densities, and so they can separate as magmas evolve.\\r\\nAs magma cools, minerals typically crystallize from the melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition of the residual melt typically changes. If crystals separate from the melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200?C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700?C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization and in the first melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.\\r\\nMagma composition can be determined by processes other than partial melting and fractional crystallization. For instance, magmas commonly interact with rocks they intrude, both by melting those rocks and by reacting with them. Magmas of different compositions can mix with one another. In rare cases, melts can separate into two immiscible melts of contrasting compositions.\\r\\nThere are relatively few minerals that are important in the formation of common igneous rocks, because the magma from which the minerals crystallize is rich in only certain elements: silicon, oxygen, aluminium, sodium, potassium, calcium, iron, and magnesium. These are the elements that combine to form the silicate minerals, which account for over ninety percent of all igneous rocks. The chemistry of igneous rocks is expressed differently for major and minor elements and for trace elements. Contents of major and minor elements are conventionally expressed as weight percent oxides (e.g., 51% SiO2, and 1.50% TiO2). Abundances of trace elements are conventionally expressed as parts per million by weight (e.g., 420 ppm Ni, and 5.1 ppm Sm). The term \\"trace element\\" is typically used for elements present in most rocks at abundances less than 100 ppm or so, but some trace elements may be present in some rocks at abundances exceeding 1,000 ppm. The diversity of rock compositions has been defined by a huge mass of analytical dataover 230,000 rock analyses can be accessed on the web through a site sponsored by the U. S. National Science Foundation (see the External Link to EarthChem).\\r\\nThe word \\"igneous\\" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning \\"of fire\\".

Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of chivalry and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.\\r\\nAfter the Norman conquest of 1066, the kings of England were vassals of the kings of France for their possessions in France. The French kings had endeavored, over the centuries, to reduce these possessions, to the effect that, roughly, only Gascony was left to the English. The confiscation or threat of confiscating this duchy had been part of French policy to check the growth of English power, particularly whenever the English were at war with the Kingdom of Scotland, an ally of France.\\r\\nIn 1316, a principle was established denying women succession to the French throne. When Charles IV of France (the last king of the senior line of the House of Capet) died without sons in 1328, his closest male relative was King Edward III of England. Through his mother, Isabella of France, Edward III was the nephew of Charles IV. Isabella claimed the French throne for her son, but the French rejected it, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. A French count, Philip of Valois, first cousin of Charles IV in the male line, succeeded to the throne as King Philip VI of France. For about nine years (1328ÿ1337), the English had accepted the Valois succession to the French throne, but the interference of the new French king in Edward III's war against Scotland prompted Edward III to reassert his claim to the French throne. Several overwhelming English victories in the warespecially at Crcy, Poitiers, and Agincourtraised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph. However, the greater resources of the French monarchy precluded a complete conquest. Starting in 1429, decisive French victories at Orlans, Patay, Formigny, and Castillon concluded the war in favour of France, with England permanently losing most of its possessions on the continent.\\r\\nHistorians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337ÿ1360); the Caroline War (1369ÿ1389); and the Lancastrian War (1415ÿ1453). Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily related to the war, including the War of the Breton Succession (1341ÿ1364), the Castilian Civil War (1366ÿ1369), the War of the Two Peters (1356ÿ1369) in Aragon, and the 1383ÿ1385 succession crisis in Portugal, were availed by the parties to advance their agendas. Later historians adopted the term \\"Hundred Years' War\\" as a historiography periodization to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in European history.\\r\\nThe war owes its historical significance to multiple factors. By its end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a dynastic conflict, the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism. The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the feudal armies where heavy cavalry had dominated, and artillery became important. The war precipitated the creation of the first standing armies in Western Europe since the time of the Western Roman Empire and thus helping to change their role in warfare. With respect to the belligerents, in France, civil wars, deadly epidemics, famines, and bandit free-companies of mercenaries reduced the population drastically. English political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of English nobles, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses (1455ÿ1487).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe root causes of the conflict can be found in the demographic, economic and political crises of 14th century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England about Gascony, Flanders and Scotland. The dynastic question, which arose due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetians, was the official pretext.\\r\\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of Louis X in 1316. Louis X left only a daughter, and his posthumous son John I lived only a few days. Philip, Count of Poitiers, brother of Louis X, asserted that women were ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as Philip V. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, Charles IV, in 1322.[8]\\r\\nCharles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. A girl ended up being born, therefore rendering the main male line of the House of Capet extinct.\\r\\nBy proximity of blood, the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew Edward III of England. Edward was the son of Isabella, the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, balked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover Roger Mortimer, who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, Edward II. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI. In 1340 the Avignon papacy confirmed that under Salic law males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.[8][9]\\r\\nEventually, Edward III reluctantly recognized Philip VI and paid him homage for his French fiefs. He made concessions in Guyenne, but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made war on Scotland.\\r\\nThe Anglo-Norman dynasty that had ruled England since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when Henry, the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Empress Matilda and great-grandson of William the Conqueror, became the first of the Angevin kings of England in 1154 as Henry II.[10] The Angevin kings directly ruled over more French territory than the kings of France. However, they still owed homage for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century onward, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, effectively neutralising the issue.[11]\\r\\nJohn I of England inherited the Angevin domains from his brother Richard I. However, Philip II of France acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions. Following John's reign, the Battle of Bouvines (1214), the Saintonge War (1242), and finally the War of Saint-Sardos (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as Duke of Aquitaine (Guyenne), were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony.[12]\\r\\nThe dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognize the suzerainty of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.\\r\\nDuring the War of Saint-Sardos, Charles of Valois, father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by Edward II of England. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.\\r\\nThe King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus Agen. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.\\r\\nIn the 11th century, Gascony in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as Guyenne or Guienne) and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: Guyenne-et-Gascogne). The Angevin kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.[13][14] At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin (Plantagenet) Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.[14][15]\\r\\nFor the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. This argument was rejected by the French so in 1329 the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword.[16] Even after this pledge of homage the French continued to pressure the English administration.[17]\\r\\nGascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.[18]\\r\\nFrance was an ally of the Kingdom of Scotland as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the area. In 1295, a treaty was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of Philip the Fair. Charles IV formally renewed the treaty in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom was attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.[19]\\r\\nPhilip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a crusade to the Holy Land. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish Navy, moved to the English Channel off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.[18] To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots \\"at a suitable time\\", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.[20]\\r\\nAt the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The arrire-ban, literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Philip then met with his Great Council in Paris. On 24 May 1337, it was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois.[21] Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.[22]\\r\\nOn 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the Count of Flanders. The civic authorities of Ghent, Ypres and Bruges proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the Low Countries. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the \\"true\\" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.[23]\\r\\nRelations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his chancellor sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.[24] At the time there were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex alone.[25] The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool that were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it.[24] France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to Flanders and the wine trade from Gascony.[26][27]\\r\\nOn 22 June 1340, Edward and his fleet sailed from England and arrived off the Zwin estuary in the next day. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of Sluis. The English fleet deceived the French into believing they were withdrawing. When the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the Battle of Sluys. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French invasions.[23] At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the Duke of Brittany precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half brother John of Montfort and Charles of Blois, nephew of Philip VI.[28]\\r\\nIn 1341, conflict over the succession to the Duchy of Brittany began the War of the Breton Succession, in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for the next few years focused around a back and forth struggle in Brittany. The city of Vannes changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.[28]\\r\\nIn July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across the channel, landing in Normandy's Cotentin, at St. Vaast. The English army captured the completely unguarded Caen in just one day, surprising the French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed. He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked.\\r\\nThe Battle of Crcy was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the longbowmen and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.[29] Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King David II of Scotland responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the Battle of Neville's Cross, on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.[28][30] In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of Calais on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to safely keep troops in northern France.[29] Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful French siege in 1558.[31]\\r\\nIn 1348, the Black Death, which had just arrived in Paris, began to ravage Europe.[32] In 1355, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially,[citation needed] King Edward's son and namesake, the Prince of Wales, later known as the Black Prince, led a Chevauche from Gascony into France, during which he pillaged Avignonet and Castelnaudary, sacked Carcassonne, and plundered Narbonne. The next year during another Chevauche he ravaged Auvergne, Limousin, and Berry but failed to take Bourges. He offered terms of peace to King John II of France (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance. This led to the Battle of Poitiers (19 September 1356) where his army routed the French.[33] During the battle, the Gascon noble Jean de Grailly, captal de Buch led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John and many of his nobles.[34][35] With John held hostage, his son the Dauphin (later to become Charles V) assumed the powers of the king as regent.[36]\\r\\nAfter the Battle of Poitiers, many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged, and chaos ruled. A contemporary report recounted:\\r\\n... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods?...\\r\\nFrom the Chronicles of Jean de Venette[37]\\r\\nEdward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of Reims for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city).[38] However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived.[39] Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation.[38] Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of Chartres. Disaster struck in a freak hailstorm on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths - the so-called Black Monday on Easter 1360. This devastated Edward's army and forced him to negotiate when approached by the French.[40] A conference was held at Brtigny that resulted in the Treaty of Brtigny (8 May 1360).[41] The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reduce King John's ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France.[34][36][42]\\r\\nThe French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brtigny set his ransom at 3?million?crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England.[36][42]\\r\\nThe French crown had been at odds with Navarre (near southern Gascony) since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power.[43] Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations.[44] In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity.[45] Charles V succeeded him as king of France.[36][46] On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.[47]\\r\\nIn 1366 there was a civil war of succession in Castile (part of modern Spain). The forces of the ruler Peter of Castile were pitched against those of his half-brother Henry of Trastmara. The English crown supported Peter and the French, Henry. French forces were led by Bertrand du Guesclin, a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastmara in his invasion of Castile.[48]\\r\\nPeter appealed to England and Aquitaine's Black Prince for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Brtigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castille. Peter was restored to power after Trastmara's army was defeated at the Battle of Njera.[49]\\r\\nAlthough the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castille campaign, the prince instituted a hearth tax. Arnaud-Amanieu VIII, Lord of Albret had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.[50] Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.[50][51]\\r\\nWith the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trastmara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the Battle of Montiel in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.[49]\\r\\nIn August 1373, John of Gaunt, accompanied by John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men out from Calais on a major chevauche. While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose them, the English began to meet further resistance as they moved south. French forces began to concentrate around the English force but, under specific orders from King Charles V, the French avoided a set battle. Instead, they fell on forces detached from the main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed the English and in October, the English found themselves being trapped against the River Allier by four separate French forces. With some difficulty, the English crossed at the bridge at Moulins but lost all their baggage and loot. The English carried on south across the Limousin plateau but the weather was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded their armour. At the beginning of December, the army finally entered friendly territory in Gascony. By the end of December they were in Bordeaux, starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of the 30,000 horses with which they had left Calais. Although the march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure.[52]\\r\\nWith his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where by now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376.[53] Edward III died the following year on 21 June 1377;[54] he was succeeded by the Black Prince's second son Richard II (the first son had died some time earlier), who was still a child.[55] The treaty at Brtigny left Edward III and England with enlarged holdings in France; however, a small professional French army under the leadership of du Guesclin pushed the English back and, by the time of Charles V's death in 1380, the English only held Calais and a few other coastal cities.[56]\\r\\nIt was usual to appoint a regent in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377.[55] However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, although Gaunt remained highly influential.[55]\\r\\nRichard faced many challenges during his reign, including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384ÿ1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.[55]\\r\\nIn July 1380, the Earl of Buckingham commanded an expedition to France to aid England's ally, the Duke of Brittany. The French refused battle before the walls of Troyes on 25 August, so Buckingham's forces continued their chevauche and in November laid siege to Nantes.[57] However, expected support from the Duke of Brittany did not appear and, in the face of heavy losses in both men and horses, was forced to abandon the siege in January 1381.[58] In February 1381, now reconciled to the regime of the new French king Charles VI, Brittany paid 50,000 francs to Buckingham for him to abandon the siege and the campaign.[59]\\r\\nAfter the deaths of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in the war. Charles VI succeeded his father as king of France at the age of 11, and he was thus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs well after Charles had achieved royal majority. Their rule was largely ineffective; the crown resources which had been built up by Charles V were squandered on their own personal interests.\\r\\nWith France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on the French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but the population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at the Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of these taxes on his deathbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate them stirred up hostility between the French government and populace.\\r\\nDifficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered the ability of the French to fight the English. At this point, the war's pace had largely slowed down, and both nations found themselves fighting mainly through proxy wars, such as during the 1383-1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in the Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by the English, won against the supporters of the King of Castile's claim to the Portuguese throne, who in turn was backed by the French.\\r\\nCharles VI assumed personal rule in about 1388. He dismissed his uncles and replaced them with his father's former advisors, which helped to significantly improve economic conditions in the kingdom. Charles then procceeded to discuss peace with the English.\\r\\nThe war became increasingly unpopular with the English public largely due to the high taxes needed to sustain it. These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.[60] Richard's increasing disinterest in the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords that included one of his uncles. This group, known as Lords Appellant, managed to successfully press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the Merciless Parliament. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of the council in 1388 and tried, unsuccessfully, to reignite the war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of a three-year truce at Leulinghen.[60][61]\\r\\nIn 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, John of Gaunt, returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled Henry of Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke returned to England with his supporters and deposed Richard and had himself crowned Henry IV.[55][61][62]\\r\\nIn Scotland, the English regime change prompted border raids that were countered by an invasion in 1402 and the defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Homildon Hill.[63] A dispute over the spoils between Henry and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland resulted in a long and bloody struggle between the two for control of northern England, resolved only with the almost complete destruction of the Percy family by 1408.[64][65]\\r\\nIn Wales, Owain Glynd?r was declared Prince of Wales on 16 September 1400. He was the leader of the most serious and widespread rebellion against English authority in Wales since the conquest of 1282ÿ1283. The rebellion was finally put down only in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.[66]\\r\\nIn the meantime, Charles VI was descending into madness, and an open conflict for power began between his cousin John the Fearless and his brother, Louis of Orlans. After Louis's assassination, the Armagnac family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war.[62] In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who massacred the Count of Armagnac and about 2,500 of his followers.[67]\\r\\nThroughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by pirates that heavily damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such privateering campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war.[68] The French responded in kind and French pirates, under Scottish protection, raided many English coastal towns.[69]\\r\\nThe domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade.[69]\\r\\nHenry IV of England died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. The mental illness of Charles VI of France allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. Henry V was well aware of these divisions and hoped to exploit them. In 1414 while he held court at Leicester, he received ambassadors from Burgundy.[70] Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter Catherine of Valois. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.[70]\\r\\nIn August 1415, Henry V sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to Harfleur. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of Crcy, he found himself outmaneuvered and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the Battle of Agincourt, north of the Somme. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.[71] Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.[70]\\r\\nHenry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and Rouen on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with the Duchy of Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke John the Fearless in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the Treaty of Troyes, by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, Charles VII, was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the Estates-General.[70]\\r\\nOn 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reverse. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir Thomas, Duke of Clarence in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by Gilbert Motier de La Fayette and John Stewart, Earl of Buchan at the Battle of Baug. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mele, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by Alexander Buchanan.[70][72] The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury, who conducted the English retreat.[73]\\r\\nHenry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and Gatinais before returning to Paris. From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of Meaux. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.[70]\\r\\nAt the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at Senlis. While there, it became apparent that he was ill (possibly dysentery), and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.[70] The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, Henry, later to become Henry VI.[74]\\r\\nOn his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France (as Henry VI was only an infant). The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the Battle of Verneuil (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baug, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.[74][75]\\r\\nThe appearance of Joan of Arc at the siege of Orlans sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.[74] The English laid siege to Orlans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully invest the city. In 1429 Joan convinced the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops, and they attacked the English redoubts, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.[76]\\r\\nThe English retreated from the Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near the village of Patay, French cavalry broke through a unit of English longbowmen that had been sent to block the road, then swept through the retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and the commander, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, was taken prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to Reims for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429.[76][77]\\r\\nAfter the coronation, Charles VII's army fared less well. An attempted French siege of Paris was defeated on 8 September 1429, and Charles VII withdrew to the Loire Valley.[78]\\r\\nHenry VI was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.[74]\\r\\nJoan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians at the siege of Compigne on 23 May 1430. The Burgundians transferred her to the English, who organised a trial headed by Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais and member of the English Council at Rouen. Joan was convicted and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.[76] (She was rehabilitated 25 years later by Pope Callixtus III.)\\r\\nAfter the death of Joan of Arc, the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English.[79] Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas Cardinal Beaufort was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the congress of Arras, in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, Philip III, duke of Burgundy, deserted to Charles VII, signing the Treaty of Arras that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.[74] The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York.[79]\\r\\nThe allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains in the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in the rest of France.[80] The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.[79]\\r\\nBy 1449, the French had retaken Rouen. In 1450 the Count of Clermont and Arthur de Richemont, Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future Arthur III, Duke of Brittany), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at the Battle of Formigny. Richemont's force attacked the English army from the flank and rear just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army.[81]\\r\\nAfter Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordnance officer Jean Bureau and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.[82]\\r\\nAlthough the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,[82] England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the Wars of the Roses, that started in 1455.[79][83]\\r\\nThe Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke Charles of Burgundy, counting on English support, took up arms against Louis XI. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying Edward IV of England off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in an agreement signed at the Treaty of Picquigny (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to claim the title until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King Louis XVIII, who was living in England after the French Revolution.[84]\\r\\nCharles the Bold, the last duke of Burgundy, was killed at the Battle of Nancy in 1477,[85] leaving a daughter, Mary, who lost the provinces of Artois, Flanders, Picardy and Burgundy to Louis XI's armies.[85]\\r\\nThe French victory marked the end of a long period of instability that had started with the Norman Conquest (1066), when William the Conqueror added \\"King of England\\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France.[86]\\r\\nWhen the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions, leaving it with only Calais on the continent. The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, but the French language in England, which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385.[87]\\r\\nNational feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.[88] In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat was one major cause of the War of the Roses (1455ÿ1487).[89]\\r\\nLowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war ÿ sales taxes, debasing the coinage ÿ and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.[90]\\r\\nBubonic plague and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.[71] Normandy lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.[91] The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.[92]\\r\\nIn 1445 the first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as compagnies d'ordonnance on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.[93]\\r\\nThe Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that warfare taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.\\r\\nBy the war's end, although the heavy cavalry was still considered the most powerful unit in an army, the heavily armored horse had to deal with several tactics developed to deny or mitigate its effective use on a battlefield.[94] The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as hobelars. Hobelars tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.[93][95][96]","input":"Who was involved in the 100 years war?"},{"output":"January 1, 1914","context":"","input":"When did the first commercial flight take place?"},{"output":"22.9 points","context":"Wardell Stephen Curry II (born March 14, 1988), commonly known as Stephen Curry (/?st?f?n/ STEF-?n) and sometimes as Steph Curry (/st?f/ STEF), is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.[1] Curry won back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player Award titles in the 2014ÿ15 and 2015ÿ16 seasons. The latter also made him the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote while leading the league in scoring, shooting above 50ÿ40ÿ90, and breaking the NBA record for most 3-pointers made in a season (402). That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season with a 73ÿ9 record. Curry led the Warriors to three straight NBA Finals appearances between 2015 and 2017, winning NBA Championships in 2015 and 2017.\\r\\nCurry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for Davidson. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, he also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made.\\r\\nDuring the 2012ÿ13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. During the 2013ÿ14 season, he and teammate Klay Thompson were nicknamed the Splash Brothers en route to setting the NBA record for combined three-pointers in a season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525) and again in the 2015ÿ16 season (678).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStephen Curry is the son of Sonya (Adams) and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[2][3] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[4] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[5] The family briefly relocated to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[4] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[6][7] He was also a member of Toronto 5ÿ0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[8][9] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[9] Curry led the team to a 33ÿ4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[10]\\r\\nFollowing Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference, all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[11] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[12]\\r\\nSources:\\r\\nBefore Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, \\"Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.\\"[13] In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out 4 assists, and grabbed 9 rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring ability helped the Wildcats to a 29ÿ5 overall record and a Southern Conference regular season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-pointer of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for 3-point field goals.[14]\\r\\nCurry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.[15] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13 seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82ÿ70.[16] At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and first team All-SoCon. He was also honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping team USA to a silver medal finish.\\r\\nIn his sophomore season in 2007ÿ08, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6?ft 3 in (1.91 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26ÿ6 regular season record, and a 20ÿ0 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA Tournament bid.\\r\\nOn March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[17] to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82ÿ76. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from 3-point range.[18] On March 23, Davidson played second seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74ÿ70 comeback victory.[17]\\r\\nOn March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73ÿ56 to advance to the Elite 8.[19] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.[19] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158.[20][21] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 57ÿ59, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[22]\\r\\nCurry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[23] He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[24] Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[25]\\r\\nAfter Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year.[20] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82ÿ78 loss to Oklahoma.[26] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game.[26] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points, in Davidson's 97ÿ70 win over Winthrop.[27] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78ÿ48.[28] In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career-high of 44 in a 72ÿ67 win over North Carolina State.\\r\\nCurry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford.[29] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career.[30] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99ÿ56 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[31] Davidson won the 2008ÿ09 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18ÿ2 in the conference.[32][33]\\r\\nIn the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84ÿ68. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history.[34] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52ÿ59. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins,[35] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70ÿ63.[36][37] Davidson then fell 68ÿ80 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[38]\\r\\nIn his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American.[39] Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[40]\\r\\nCurry was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[41] His rookie contract was worth $12.7 million over four years.[42] In his first career game, he scored 14 points and distributed 7 assists.[43] With final season averages of 17.5 points, 5.9 assists, and 1.9 steals per game,[41] he finished second in NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans, and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[44]\\r\\nAt the 2011 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry won the NBA All-Star Weekend Skills Challenge.[45] He finished the season with averages of 18.6 points, 5.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game and shot a franchise- and league-best 93.4 percent from the free throw line.[41][46] He was also the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award.[47]\\r\\nIn May 2011, Curry had surgery on his right ankle to repair torn ligaments that were caused by multiple sprains from the previous season.[50] The ankle healed in time for the start of the 2011ÿ12 campaign, but he sprained it again during the preseason and on January 4 in a game against the San Antonio Spurs.[51][52][53] On February 22, he strained a tendon in his right foot in a game against the Phoenix Suns.[54] In April, he had another surgery.[55] In total, Curry appeared in only 26 regular season games and his scoring average dipped to 14.7 points per game.[41]\\r\\nPrior to the start of the 2012ÿ13 season, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension with the Warriors.[56] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[57] Over the course of the year, Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname \\"The Splash Brothers\\".[58] On February 27, Curry scored a career-high 54 points in a game against the New York Knicks, setting a franchise record for three-pointers made in a game with 11 and falling just one shy of tying the NBA record.[59][60] In the final game of the season, he set a new league record for three-pointers made in a single season.[61] His final averages were 22.9 points and 6.9 assists per game.[41] The Warriors finished the year with 47 wins, earning them the sixth seed in the Western Conference and a matchup with the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.[62] Golden State defeated the Nuggets in six games to advance to the second round, where Curry scored 44 points in a Game 1 loss to the Spurs.[63] The Warriors eventually lost the series in six games.[64]\\r\\nIn December of the 2013ÿ14 season, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[65] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance, starting for the West.[66] Behind averages of 24 points and 8.5 assists per game, he was selected to his first All-NBA Team.[41] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive year, the Warriors drew the Los Angeles Clippers to begin the postseason.[67] In Game 4, Curry scored 33 points, including a then playoff career-high seven three-pointers, in a winning effort.[68] Golden State went on to lose the series in seven games.[67]\\r\\nPrior to the start of the 2014ÿ15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach.[70] Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title contender.[71] On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks.[72] He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night.[73][74] On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[75] The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of 23.8 points, 7.7 assists and 2 steals per game.[41] Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory.[76]\\r\\nIn Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register six three-pointers and six steals in a game.[77] In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high eight three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory.[78] In Game 3 of the Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason.[79][80] The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2.[81] In Game 5, he scored 37 points,[82] and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years.[83] For the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game.[82]\\r\\nOn October 27, 2015, Curry scored 40 points (including a career-high 24 points in the first quarter) in the Warriors' season opening win over the New Orleans Pelicans, the most points scored by a reigning MVP in an opener since 1972 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar scored 41 for the Milwaukee Bucks.[84] In addition, Curry started his seventh straight season opener, joining Jeff Mullins, and Chris Mullin as the only Warriors' players since 1962 to do so.[84] Two games later on October 31, also against the Pelicans, Curry scored 53 points on 17-of-27 shooting to lead the Warriors to a 134ÿ120 win. Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989ÿ90 to score 118 points in the first three games of a season.[85] On November 24, he scored 24 points in a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, as the Warriors set the record for best start in NBA history at 16ÿ0.[86] The Warriors improved to 24ÿ0 on December 11 with a double overtime win over the Boston Celtics, before finally having their streak broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks.[87]\\r\\nOn December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and 10 assists in a 122ÿ103 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game against the Kings, Curry was guarded by his brother Seth for the first time in their NBA careers.[88] On January 22, he recorded his second triple-double of the season and seventh of his career with 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 122ÿ110 win over the Indiana Pacers. He made eight three-pointers in the game to reach 200 for the season, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 200 three-pointers in four straight seasons.[89] On February 3, he made 11 three-pointers (including seven in the first quarter) and scored 51 points (including a career-high 36 points in the first half) to lead the Warriors past the Washington Wizards 134ÿ121. His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record.[90] During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Shootout, where he lost in the final round to teammate Klay Thompson. At 48ÿ4, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995ÿ96 Chicago Bulls and 1966ÿ67 Philadelphia 76ers.[91]\\r\\nOn February 25, Curry made 10 three-pointers and scored 51 points to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130ÿ114. Curry topped 50 points for the third time in 2015ÿ16, the first player to do it that many times since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did so in 2008ÿ09. Curry also surpassed Kyle Korver's mark of 127 straight games with a three-pointer.[92] In the following game two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime thanks to a Curry three-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining. Curry finished with 46 points as his winning shot was his 12th three-pointer, tying the NBA single-game record (with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall).[93] He also broke his own NBA record for threes in a season, leaving the new mark at 288.[94] On March 7, in a win over the Orlando Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 three-pointers in a season.[95] On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Boston Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, losing 109ÿ106 to the Celtics to snap an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena.[96] On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112ÿ101 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[97] In the Warriors' regular season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry achieved another shooting milestone, becoming the first player to make 400 three-pointers in a season by knocking down 10 from long range on his way to 46 points and 402 total three-pointers. With a 125ÿ104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995ÿ96 Chicago Bulls' 72ÿ10 record to finish the 2015ÿ16 season with just nine losses.[98] With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50ÿ40ÿ90 club, representing the shooting percentages from the field (.504), beyond the arc (.454), and the free-throw line (.908).[99]\\r\\nAs the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference, the Warriors faced the eighth-seeded Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. In a Game 1 win, Curry scored 24 first-half points before an ankle injury ruled him out for the rest of the game.[100] He subsequently missed Games 2 and 3 of the series, which the Warriors split for a 2ÿ1 lead.[101] Curry returned in Game 4, but sprained his right knee on the final play of the second quarter. He did not play in the second half, but the Warriors won 121ÿ94.[102] He was diagnosed with a sprained right medial collateral ligament (MCL) and was ruled out for two weeks.[103] Without Curry, the Warriors defeated the Rockets in Game 5 to move on to the second round, where they faced the Portland Trail Blazers. Curry missed the first three games of the series, as the Warriors led 2ÿ1 after Game 3. Curry returned to action in Game 4, coming off the bench to record 40 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists in a 132ÿ125 overtime win.[104] Seventeen of those points came in the extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime.[105] A day after returning from injury, Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in NBA history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06.[106] Curry led the Warriors to a 4ÿ1 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. After going down 3ÿ1, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4ÿ3 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals.[107] In the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland.[108] Still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in a Finals.[109] However, the Warriors, despite being up 3ÿ1 in the series, were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3ÿ1. In the Game 7 loss, Curry scored 17 points on 6-of-19 shooting.[110]\\r\\nAfter dropping their season opener at home to the San Antonio Spurs on October 25, the Warriors levelled their record at 1ÿ1 with a 122ÿ114 win over the New Orleans Pelicans three days later. Curry hit four three-pointers against the Pelicans to reach 1,600 for his career, becoming the 19th player to do so, as well as the fastest to reach the mark.[111] On November 4, 2016, Curry's NBA-record streak of 157 straight games with at least one made three-pointer was snapped during the Warriors' 117ÿ97 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers after he went 0-of-10 from three-point range. He had hit a three-pointer in every regular-season game since November 11, 2014.[112] Three days later, he hit 13 three-pointers against New Orleans, setting an NBA record for most three-pointers made in a regular-season game. Curry shot 16-of-26 overall against the Pelicans for his first 40-point game of the season, finishing with 46 in a 116ÿ106 win.[113] On December 11, Curry hit two three-pointers against the Minnesota Timberwolves to pass Steve Nash for 17th on the NBA's career three-pointers list.[114] With 14 points against the Dallas Mavericks on December 30, Curry (11,903) passed Purvis Short (11,894) for seventh place on the Warriors' all-time scoring list.[115] In a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on January 6, 2017, Curry had his second 40-point game of the season and reached the 12,000-point threshold, becoming the seventh player in Warriors history to score 12,000 career points.[116] Three days later, Curry was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 2 through Sunday, January 8.[117] It marked his eighth career Player of the Week honor, more than any other player in franchise history.[116] On January 19, Curry was named a starter on the Western Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[118] On January 28, he scored 25 of his 43 points in the third quarter of the Warriors' 144ÿ98 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. He also had nine three-pointers against the Clippers.[119] On February 1, he hit 11 three-pointers and scored 39 points in a 126ÿ111 win over the Charlotte Hornets.[120] The following day, he was named Co-Western Conference Player of the Month for January alongside teammate Kevin Durant[121] and hit his 200th three-pointer of the season in the Warriors' 133ÿ120 win over the Clippers, making him the first player in NBA history to have 200 or more three-pointers in five consecutive seasons.[122] On March 5, he scored 31 points and moved into the top 10 on the NBA's career three-point list in a 112ÿ105 win over the New York Knicks. Curry hit five three-pointers, passing Chauncey Billups for 10th place, and added eight rebounds and six assists.[123] On April 2, Curry hit nine three-pointers and scored 42 points in a 139ÿ115 win over the Washington Wizards.[124] Three days later, he had another 42-point effort in a 120ÿ111 win over the Phoenix Suns, helping the Warriors clinch the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight season.[125]\\r\\nOn April 24, Curry scored 37 points in Game 4 to help the Warriors sweep their first-round playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers and advance to the conference semifinals.[126] On May 8, he scored 30 points in Game 4 to help the Warriors sweep their second-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz and advance to the Western Conference Finals.[127] In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs on May 14, Curry scored 40 points and hit a tying 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining to help the Warriors rally from a 25-point deficit to win 113ÿ111; the Warriors overcame their largest halftime deficit ever in the postseason at 20 points.[128] In a 120ÿ108 Game 3 win, Curry scored 21 points and became the franchise leader in postseason points, passing Rick Barry. They went up 3ÿ0 in the series, becoming the third team in NBA history to win their first 11 playoff games.[129] His 36 points in Game 4 led to a 129ÿ115 victory that saw the Warriors advance to the NBA Finals for a third straight year while becoming the first team in league history to start the playoffs 12ÿ0.[130] In Game 2 of the 2017 NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Curry recorded his first career postseason triple-double with 32 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds to help the Warriors go up 2ÿ0 in the series with a 132ÿ113 win.[131] Curry helped the Warriors clinch the series and the championship in Game 5 with 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, as Golden State claimed its second title in three years.[132]\\r\\nOn July 1, 2017, Curry agreed to a five-year, $201 million extension with the Warriors, becoming the first NBA player to sign a supermax contract worth over $200 million.[133] He officially signed the contract on July 25.[134] On October 21, in the Warriors' third game of the season, Curry was ejected after throwing his mouthpiece in the direction of a referee.[135] The Warriors lost the game 111ÿ101 to the Memphis Grizzlies, and Curry received a $50,000 fine, the maximum amount the NBA can fine players for.[136] On November 19, he had season highs with 39 points and 11 rebounds in a 118ÿ111 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He also had seven assists, committed seven turnovers, and fouled out of the game with three minutes to go in the fourth quarter.[137] On December 1, he scored 23 points and passed Jason Kidd for eighth place on the career three-pointers made list in a 133ÿ112 win over the Orlando Magic.[138] On December 4, in a 125ÿ115 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, Curry hit five three-pointers to become the fastest NBA player to achieve the milestone of 2,000 career three-pointers, achieving that mark in just 597 games, 227 less than the previous fastest player to achieve that mark, Ray Allen.[139][140] In that same game, Curry twisted his right ankle, the same ankle that had previously been surgically repaired, and was forced to exit the game early. Though x-rays of the injury turned out negative, and an MRI found no structural damage, Curry was ruled out for two weeks.[141]\\r\\nCurry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal.[142] In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (known later as FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament.[143] In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game.[144] On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.[145]\\r\\nStanding at 6 feet 3 inches tall (1.91 m) and weighing 190 pounds (86?kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 22.9 points, 6.8 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 1.8 steals per game. He has been selected to four All-NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice.[41]\\r\\nCurry is considered to be an important leader within the Warriors organization; he is known for his humility and work ethic.[146][147] Curry is said to have played a significant role in the recruitment of former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors.[148]\\r\\nCurry is known for his elite shooting ability; he is able to score in great volume from underneath the rim all the way to near half-court.[149] He is considered by many to be among the greatest scorers in NBA history.[150][151][152] [152][153] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is able to get the ball out of his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up, adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block.[154] In addition to his quick release, he puts extra pressure on defenses with his long range, leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016.[155] As of December 2017, he ranks fourth in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three-pointers made.[156][157][158] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder.[139] In an article for FiveThirtyEight, Benjamin Morris emphasized Curry's importance in the NBA's increasing use of the three-point shot, writing, \\"Curry is perhaps the figurehead in the NBA's Three-Point Revolution.\\"[159]\\r\\nSome experts have commented that Curry's elite scoring ability creates a \\"gravity\\" effect, forcing opposing defenders to double-team him even when he doesn't have the ball, which creates mismatches that his teammates are able to exploit.[160][161]\\r\\nCurry is also known as a clutch scorer, often shooting at his best in high-pressure moments, and taking game-winning shots.[162][163]\\r\\nCurry is an exceptional free throw shooter, with a career free throw average of over 90% through December 2017, the third highest in NBA history.[164][165] He is currently the Warriors' all-time free-throw leader, and led the NBA in free throw shooting average in the 2014ÿ15 and 2015ÿ16 seasons.[166]\\r\\nThough capable stealing the ball, having led the league in steals for the 2015ÿ16 season, Curry is not considered to be an elite defender, and his teammates frequently take the more difficult defensive assignments.[160]\\r\\nOn July 30, 2011, Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte.[7][8][167][168] Together, they have two daughters, Riley (b. 2012) and Ryan (b. 2015).[169][170] They currently reside in Alamo, California.[171] Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player,[172] and his younger sister, Sydel, plays volleyball at Elon University.[173]\\r\\nCurry has been outspoken about his Christian faith.[174][175] Curry spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying, \\"People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior.\\" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a \\"heart for God\\" and as a reminder that he plays for God.[176] On some of his \\"Curry One\\" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted \\"4:13\\".[177] It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads \\"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\\".[178][179] Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians, 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (\\"Love never fails...\\").[180] Curry is also an investor in Active Faith, a Christian sports apparel brand.[181][182]\\r\\nDuring the 1992 All-Star Weekend, Curry's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrovi?, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dra?en Petrovi?, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Contest. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dra?en Petrovi? Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.[183]\\r\\nOn September 22, 2017, Curry tweeted that he did not want to visit the White House. The next day, President Donald Trump tweeted that since Curry was \\"hesitating\\" he was no longer welcome at the White House.[184]\\r\\nIn 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015ÿ2020.[185][186]\\r\\nIn 2015, Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat's name on them (one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting). According to his sister Suzanne, Deah Barakat was known for his \\"love for basketball and anything Steph Curry.\\"[187] Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30 and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ.[187] Curry said that Barakat's family \\"did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality [...] It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family [...] I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully they know that I've been thinking about them.\\"[188][189][190] Also in 2015, after winning the MVP award following his impressive season, Curry donated his prize vehiclea 2016 Kia Sorentoto the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena.[191]\\r\\nCurry is currently one of the most successful players in the NBA, and he has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James.[192][193] His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA.[194][195] Curry's jersey was the top seller in the NBA for the 2015ÿ16 and 2016ÿ17 NBA seasons.[196] ESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes, while Forbes has ranked him among the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements.[197][198]\\r\\nCurry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, where he is considered to be the \\"face of their footwear line\\".[199] Originally signed to Nike, Curry joined with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason.[200] As Curry became MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of his shoes have become a major factor for the brand, with stock prices rising and falling based on the success of the Curry shoe line.[201][202]\\r\\nCurry is an avid golfer; he played golf in high school, and frequently plays golf with teammate Andre Iguodala.[203][204] A 5-handicap golfer, Curry participates in celebrity golf tournaments, and has played golf alongside Barack Obama.[205][206][207] In August 2017, Curry competed in the Ellie Mae Classic on an unrestricted sponsor exemption.[208] Though he missed the first cut, he scored 4-over-74 for both days he participated, surpassing most expectations for an amateur competing in the pro event.[209]\\r\\nOn September 20, 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line will include: hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs of epic moments, flashy framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces.[210]\\r\\nBriefly pursuing a career in rap music, Curry appeared in a rap song while attending Davidson College.[211][212] His style has been compared to the one of rapper Nas.[213] He has also been mentioned in numerous rap songs.[214]","input":"How many points does curry average a game?"},{"output":"at IBM","context":"This article discusses the major developments in the 'history of programming languages.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though a huge number of computer languages exist, the earliest computers were programmed in binary so the set of instructions was just a series of 0 and 1. Computer languages are a fairly new field, since the first high-level languages were written in the 1950s, around the time computers were invented. Before computer programming languages were made, paper tapes and punch cards which held complicated weaving patterns for the loom Tabulating Machine Company Looms by Jacquard in 1710. A century later, Charles Babbage started building a computing and the analytical Machine. In the 20th century, Herman Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine. His machine tabulators were used to speed up the counting and sorting of punch cards. In the early 1940s J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly started building the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), which was completed by 1946.\\r\\nThe very first high-level programming language was FORTRAN, which stands for FORmula TRANslation. It was developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by John Backus, a worker at IBM. FORTRAN's goal was to ease the pain of writing in assembly language. When FORTRAN was first introduced, it was looked on suspiciously since almost all the programmers then only worked with the machine code and assembly languages. The programmers at that time had an initial belief that programs compiled from high-level language would be less efficient than those written at low-level. In order to persuade potential users of the benefits of working with a high-level language, Backus designed an excellent compiler for FORTRAN so the programs were just as efficient as those written in low-level languages. This was the best compiler for many years.\\r\\nFORTRAN soon became popular because it provided a realistic and desirable alternative to low-level language programming for mathematical and scientific applications. This programming language was also the first to be widely used. However, one of the limitations of FORTRAN was that it was specifically oriented toward the IBM 704 machine. This is a major set-back since the language syntax contains many idiosyncrasies from the IBM 704 machine. From a pure programming language design standpoint this is a \\"cardinal sin\\" but historically, it is understandable. FORTRAN is known for its efficiency. Over the years, FORTRAN had been upgraded and developed into FORTRAN -II, FORTRAN -IV, FORTRAN -66, and FORTRAN -77. Early versions of FORTRAN largely restricted users. On the other hand, the later versions allowed more flexibility, but since it has adapted, it is not as easy to use as it should be. The development of the fast string processing makes FORTRAN more of a general-purpose language than it used to be, but it is still described as a mathematical or scientific language.\\r\\nDuring a nine-month period in 1842ÿ1843, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine, the analytical engine. With the article she appended a set of notes which specified in complete detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first computer program.[1]\\r\\nHerman Hollerith realized that he could encode information on punch cards when he observed that train conductors encode the appearance of the ticket holders on the train tickets using the position of punched holes on the tickets[2]. Hollerith then encoded the 1890 American census data on punch cards.\\r\\nThe first computer codes were specialized for their applications. In the first decades of the 20th century, numerical calculations were based on decimal numbers. Eventually it was realized that logic could be represented with numbers, not only with words. For example, Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulatic way. The Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine, for example, in use at the telephone companies. Turing machines set the basis for storage of programs as data in the von Neumann architecture of computers by representing a machine through a finite number. However, unlike the lambda calculus, Turing's code does not serve well as a basis for higher-level languagesits principal use is in rigorous analyses of algorithmic complexity.\\r\\nLike many \\"firsts\\" in history, the first modern programming language is hard to identify. From the start, the restrictions of the hardware defined the language. Punch cards allowed 80 columns, but some of the columns had to be used for a sorting number on each card. FORTRAN included some keywords which were the same as English words, such as \\"IF\\", \\"GOTO\\" (go to) and \\"CONTINUE\\". The use of a magnetic drum for memory meant that computer programs also had to be interleaved with the rotations of the drum. Thus the programs were more hardware-dependent.\\r\\nTo some people, what was the first modern programming language depends on how much power and human-readability is required before the status of \\"programming language\\" is granted. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine both had simple, extremely limited languages for describing the actions that these machines should perform. One can even regard the punch holes on a player piano scroll as a limited domain-specific language, albeit not designed for human consumption.\\r\\nIn the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.\\r\\nThe first programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalkl, developed by the Germans for Z1 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.[3]\\r\\nJohn Mauchly's Short Code, proposed in 1949, was one of the first high-level languages ever developed for an electronic computer.[4] Unlike machine code, Short Code statements represented mathematical expressions in understandable form. However, the program had to be translated into machine code every time it ran, making the process much slower than running the equivalent machine code.\\r\\nAt the University of Manchester, Alick Glennie developed Autocode in the early 1950s. A programming language, it used a compiler to automatically convert the language into machine code. The first code and compiler was developed in 1952 for the Mark 1 computer at the University of Manchester and is considered to be the first compiled high-level programming language.[5][6]\\r\\nThe second autocode was developed for the Mark 1 by R. A. Brooker in 1954 and was called the \\"Mark 1 Autocode\\". Brooker also developed an autocode for the Ferranti Mercury in the 1950s in conjunction with the University of Manchester. The version for the EDSAC 2 was devised by D. F. Hartley of University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in 1961. Known as EDSAC 2 Autocode, it was a straight development from Mercury Autocode adapted for local circumstances, and was noted for its object code optimisation and source-language diagnostics which were advanced for the time. A contemporary but separate thread of development, Atlas Autocode was developed for the University of Manchester Atlas 1 machine.\\r\\nIn 1954, language FORTRAN was invented at IBM by John Backus; it was the first widely used high level general purpose programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.[7][8] It is still a popular language for high-performance computing[9] and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.[10]\\r\\nAnother early programming language was devised by Grace Hopper in the US, called FLOW-MATIC. It was developed for the UNIVAC I at Remington Rand during the period from 1955 until 1959. Hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation, and in early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for an English programming language and implemented a prototype.[11] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959.[12] Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of COBOL, since only it and its direct descendent AIMACO were in actual use at the time.[13]\\r\\nOther languages still in use today include LISP (1958), invented by John McCarthy and COBOL (1959), created by the Short Range Committee. Another milestone in the late 1950s was the publication, by a committee of American and European computer scientists, of \\"a new language for algorithms\\"; the ALGOL 60 Report (the \\"ALGOrithmic Language\\"). This report consolidated many ideas circulating at the time and featured three key language innovations:\\r\\nAnother innovation, related to this, was in how the language was described:\\r\\nAlgol 60 was particularly influential in the design of later languages, some of which soon became more popular. The Burroughs large systems were designed to be programmed in an extended subset of Algol.\\r\\nAlgol's key ideas were continued, producing ALGOL 68:\\r\\nAlgol 68's many little-used language features (for example, concurrent and parallel blocks) and its complex system of syntactic shortcuts and automatic type coercions made it unpopular with implementers and gained it a reputation of being difficult. Niklaus Wirth actually walked out of the design committee to create the simpler Pascal language.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:\\r\\nEach of these languages spawned an entire family of descendants, and most modern languages count at least one of them in their ancestry.\\r\\nThe 1960s and 1970s also saw considerable debate over the merits of \\"structured programming\\", which essentially meant programming without the use of \\"goto\\". A significant fraction of programmers believed that, even in languages that provide \\"goto\\", it is bad programming style to use it except in rare circumstances. This debate was closely related to language design: some languages did not include a \\"goto\\" at all, which forced structured programming on the programmer.\\r\\nTo provide even faster compile times, some languages were structured for \\"one-pass compilers\\" which expect subordinate routines to be defined first, as with Pascal, where the main routine, or driver function, is the final section of the program listing.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe 1980s were years of relative consolidation in imperative languages. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decade. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth-generation programming languages that incorporated logic programming constructs. The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Research in Miranda, a functional language with lazy evaluation, began to take hold in this decade.\\r\\nOne important new trend in language design was an increased focus on programming for large-scale systems through the use of modules, or large-scale organizational units of code. Modula, Ada, and ML all developed notable module systems in the 1980s. Module systems were often wedded to generic programming constructs---generics being, in essence, parametrized modules[citation needed] (see also polymorphism in object-oriented programming).\\r\\nAlthough major new paradigms for imperative programming languages did not appear, many researchers expanded on the ideas of prior languages and adapted them to new contexts. For example, the languages of the Argus and Emerald systems adapted object-oriented programming to distributed systems.\\r\\nThe 1980s also brought advances in programming language implementation. The RISC movement in computer architecture postulated that hardware should be designed for compilers rather than for human assembly programmers. Aided by processor speed improvements that enabled increasingly aggressive compilation techniques, the RISC movement sparked greater interest in compilation technology for high-level languages.\\r\\nLanguage technology continued along these lines well into the 1990s.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nThe rapid growth of the Internet in the mid-1990s was the next major historic event in programming languages. By opening up a radically new platform for computer systems, the Internet created an opportunity for new languages to be adopted. In particular, the JavaScript programming language rose to popularity because of its early integration with the Netscape Navigator web browser. Various other scripting languages achieved widespread use in developing customized applications for web servers such as PHP. The 1990s saw no fundamental novelty in imperative languages, but much recombination and maturation of old ideas. This era began the spread of functional languages. A big driving philosophy was programmer productivity. Many \\"rapid application development\\" (RAD) languages emerged, which usually came with an IDE, garbage collection, and were descendants of older languages. All such languages were object-oriented. These included Object Pascal, Visual Basic, and Java. Java in particular received much attention.\\r\\nMore radical and innovative than the RAD languages were the new scripting languages. These did not directly descend from other languages and featured new syntaxes and more liberal incorporation of features. Many consider these scripting languages to be more productive than even the RAD languages, but often because of choices that make small programs simpler but large programs more difficult to write and maintain.[citation needed] Nevertheless, scripting languages came to be the most prominent ones used in connection with the Web.\\r\\nSome notable languages that were developed in this period include:\\r\\nProgramming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included:\\r\\nSome notable languages developed during this period include:\\r\\nSome key people who helped develop programming languages:","input":"Where was the first high-level language operating system created?"},{"output":"95ÿ100 percent","context":"Oxygen saturation is the fraction of oxygen-saturated hemoglobin relative to total hemoglobin (unsaturated + saturated) in the blood. The human body requires and regulates a very precise and specific balance of oxygen in the blood. Normal blood oxygen levels in humans are considered 95ÿ100 percent. If the level is below 90 percent, it is considered low resulting in hypoxemia.[1] Blood oxygen levels below 80 percent may compromise organ function, such as the brain and heart, and should be promptly addressed. Continued low oxygen levels may lead to respiratory or cardiac arrest. Oxygen therapy may be used to assist in raising blood oxygen levels. Oxygenation occurs when oxygen molecules (O\\r\\n2) enter the tissues of the body. For example, blood is oxygenated in the lungs, where oxygen molecules travel from the air and into the blood. Oxygenation is commonly used to refer to medical oxygen saturation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn medicine, oxygen saturation (SO2), commonly referred to as \\"sats\\", measures the percentage of hemoglobin binding sites in the bloodstream occupied by oxygen.[2] At low partial pressures of oxygen, most hemoglobin is deoxygenated. At around 90% (the value varies according to the clinical context) oxygen saturation increases according to an oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve and approaches 100% at partial oxygen pressures of >10 kPa. A pulse oximeter relies on the light absorption characteristics of saturated hemoglobin to give an indication of oxygen saturation.\\r\\nThe body maintains a stable level of oxygen saturation for the most part by chemical processes of aerobic metabolism associated with breathing. Using the respiratory system, red blood cells, specifically the hemoglobin, gather oxygen in the lungs and distribute it to the rest of the body. The needs of the body's blood oxygen may fluctuate such as during exercise when more oxygen is required [3] or when living at higher altitudes. A blood cell is said to be \\"saturated\\" when carrying a normal amount of oxygen.[4] Both too high and too low levels can have adverse effects on the body.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation, as determined by an arterial blood gas test[5]) value below 60% causes hypoxemia (which can also be caused by anemia). Hypoxemia due to low SaO2 is indicated by cyanosis. Oxygen saturation can be measured in different tissues:[5]\\r\\nwhere HbO2 is oxygenated haemoglobin and Hb is deoxygenated haemoglobin\\r\\nPulse oximetry is a method used to estimate the percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in the blood.[6] This approximation to SaO2 is designated SpO2 (peripheral oxygen saturation). The pulse oximeter consists of a small device that clips to the body (typically a finger, earlobe or an infant's foot) and transfers its readings to a reading meter by wire or wirelessly. The device uses light-emitting diodes in conjunction with a light-sensitive sensor to measure the absorption of red and infrared light in the extremity. The difference in absorption between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin makes the calculation possible.[5]\\r\\nHealthy individuals at sea level usually exhibit oxygen saturation values between 96% and 99%, and should be above 94%. At 1,600 meters' altitude (about one mile high) oxygen saturation should be above 92%.[8]\\r\\nAn SaO2 (arterial oxygen saturation) value below 90% causes hypoxia (which can also be caused by anemia). Hypoxia due to low SaO2 is indicated by cyanosis, but oxygen saturation does not directly reflect tissue oxygenation. The affinity of hemoglobin to oxygen may impair or enhance oxygen release at the tissue level. Oxygen is more readily released to the tissues (i.e., hemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen) when pH is decreased, body temperature is increased, arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) is increased, and 2,3-DPG levels (a byproduct of glucose metabolism also found in stored blood products) are increased. When the hemoglobin has greater affinity for oxygen, less is available to the tissues. Conditions such as increased pH, decreased temperature, decreased PaCO2, and decreased 2,3-DPG will increase oxygen binding to the hemoglobin and limit its release to the tissue.[9]","input":"What is the normal oxygen level in the human body?"},{"output":"about 6 by 8 feet","context":"A prison cell, also known as a jail cell, is a small room in a prison or police station where a prisoner is held.

Prison cells vary in size internationally from  2 m2 in Guinea to 12 m2 in Switzerland.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, prison cells are usually about 6 by 8 feet in dimension[citation needed], with steel or brick walls and one solid or barred door that locks from the outside.

It is number 333 in the Aarne-Thompson classification system for folktales.[3] Variations of the story have developed, incorporating various cultural beliefs and regional dialects into the story. An example of this is \\"Kawoni's Journey Across the Mountain: A Cherokee Little Red Riding Hood\\", which introduces Cherokee myths and language into the traditional story. Another such example is \\"Petite Rouge Riding Hood\\", which approaches the story from a Cajun perspective.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood. In Grimms' and Perrault's versions of the tale, she is named after her magical red hooded cape/cloak that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In the Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path.\\r\\nA Big Bad Wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, and she na?vely tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be the girl. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma.\\r\\nWhen the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \\"What a deep voice you have!\\" (\\"The better to greet you with\\", responds the wolf), \\"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\\" (\\"The better to see you with\\", responds the wolf), \\"And what big hands you have!\\" (\\"The better to hug/grab you with\\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \\"What a big mouth you have\\" (\\"The better to eat you with!\\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of bed and eats her up too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions the story continues generally as follows:\\r\\nA woodcutter in the French version, but a hunter in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue and with his ax cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge unharmed. They then fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and tries to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she is eaten where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his ax.[4]\\r\\nThe tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the forest, conventional antitheses that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that.[citation needed] It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in the Grimms' version).[citation needed]\\r\\nA very similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in Kabylia, where a number of versions are attested.[6] The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand-)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well-known song by the modern singer Idir, A Vava Inouva:\\r\\nThe theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its belly is also reflected in the Russian tale Peter and the Wolf[citation needed] and another Grimm tale The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids,[citation needed] but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, Jonah and the Whale.[citation needed] The theme also appears in the story of the life of Saint Margaret, wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a dragon,[citation needed] and in the epic \\"The Red Path\\" by Jim C. Hines.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by Pausanias in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered up as a sacrifice.[8] There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \\"Fire\\") and a man with some name meaning \\"wolf\\".[9] The Roman poet Horace alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of Lamia, a female ogress in classical mythology.[10]\\r\\nThe dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse Trymskviea from the Elder Edda; the giant Trymr had stolen Mj?lner, Thor's hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, Loki explains them as Freyja's not having slept, or eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding.[11]\\r\\nThe origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to versions from various European countries and more than likely preceding the 17th century, of which several exist, some significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by French peasants in the 10th century[1] and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Liege.[12] In Italy, the Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including La finta nonna (The False Grandmother), written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection.[13] It has also been called \\"The Story of Grandmother\\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \\"Grandaunt Tiger\\").[14]\\r\\nThese early variations of the tale differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes an ogre, vampire[15], or a 'bzou' (werewolf), making these tales relevant to the werewolf-trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of Peter Stumpp).[16] The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and meat for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire.[17] In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there.[18] In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \\"grandmother\\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.[19] Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent.[18]\\r\\nIn other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.[20] And in another version the wolf is pushed into the fire, while he is preparing the meat of the grandmother to be eaten by the girl.[18]\\r\\nIn 2013, it was revealed from scientific research that the tale originated in the 1st century in Europe and not, as previously assumed, in China. The scientists analysed the storylines and characters from 58 versions of the tale from different areas. By means of a computer model they then determined how the different versions of Little Red Riding Hood are related.[21]\\r\\nThe earliest known printed version[22] was known as Le Petit Chaperon Rouge and may have had its origins in 17th-century French folklore. It was included in the collection Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose (Histoires et contes du temps pass, avec des moralits. Contes de ma mre l'Oye), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this version[23] is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.[24]\\r\\nThe story had as its subject an \\"attractive, well-bred young lady\\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for the Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending.\\r\\nCharles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale:[25] so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning:\\r\\nFrom this story one learns that children, especially young lasses, pretty, courteous and well-bred, do very wrong to listen to strangers, And it is not an unheard thing if the Wolf is thereby provided with his dinner. I say Wolf, for all wolves are not of the same sort; there is one kind with an amenable disposition ÿ neither noisy, nor hateful, nor angry, but tame, obliging and gentle, following the young maids in the streets, even into their homes. Alas! Who does not know that these gentle wolves are of all such creatures the most dangerous!\\r\\nThis, the presumed original, version of the tale was written for late seventeenth-century French court of King Louis XIV. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning.\\r\\nIn the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to Jacob Grimm and his younger brother Wilhelm Grimm, known as the Brothers Grimm, the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791ÿ1860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788ÿ1856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as Rotk?ppchen was included in the first edition of their collection Kinder- und Hausm?rchen (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).[26]\\r\\nThe earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.[27] However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, which appears to be the source.[28] The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.[29]\\r\\nThe Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.[30] It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes.\\r\\nNumerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale.\\r\\nAndrew Lang included a variant called \\"The True History of Little Goldenhood\\"[31] in The Red Fairy Book (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles,[32] in Contes of Charles Marelles. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted.\\r\\nJames N. Barker wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand.\\r\\nIn the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, deconstruction and feminist critical theory. (See \\"Modern uses and adaptations\\" below.) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by Alan Dundes and Jack Zipes.\\r\\nBesides the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.[33] Some are listed below.\\r\\nFolklorists and cultural anthropologists, such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor, saw \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn.[34] In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sk?ll, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnar?k, or Fenrir.[35] Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter.[36]\\r\\nThe tale has been interpreted as a puberty rite, stemming from a prehistoric origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era).[37] The girl, leaving home, enters a liminal state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf's belly.[38]\\r\\nBruno Bettelheim, in The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales (1976), recast the Little Red Riding Hood motif in terms of classic Freudian analysis, that shows how fairy tales educate, support, and liberate children's emotions. The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a \\"rebirth\\"; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person.[39]\\r\\nThe poem \\"Trymskviea\\" from the Poetic Edda mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood. Loki's explanations for the strange behavior of \\"Freyja\\" (actually Thor disguised as Freyja) mirror the wolf's explanations for his strange appearance. The red hood has often been given great importance in many interpretations, with a significance from the dawn to blood.[40]\\r\\nA sexual analysis of the tale may also include negative connotations in terms of rape or abduction. In Against Our Will, Susan Brownmiller describes the fairy tale as a description of rape.[41] However, many revisionist retellings choose to focus on empowerment, and depict Little Red Riding Hood or the grandmother successfully defending herself against the wolf.[42]\\r\\nSuch tellings bear some similarity to the \\"animal bridegroom\\" tales, such as Beauty and the Beast or The Frog Prince, but where the heroines of those tales transform the hero into a prince, these tellings of Little Red Riding Hood reveal to the heroine that she has a wild nature like the hero's.[43] These interpretations refuse to characterize Little Red Riding Hood as a victim; these are tales of female empowerment.","input":"When was little red riding hood first published?"},{"output":"female figures","context":"The ancient Cycladic culture flourished in the islands of the Aegean Sea from c. 3300 to 1100 BCE.[2] Along with the Minoan civilization and Mycenaean Greece, the Cycladic people are counted among the three major Aegean cultures.

These marble figures are seen scattered around the Aegean, suggesting that these figures were popular amongst the people of Crete and mainland Greece.[4] Perhaps the most famous of these figures are musicians: one a harp-player the other a pipe-player.[5] Dating to approximately 2500 BCE, these musicians are sometimes considered the earliest extant musicians from the Aegean.[6]\\r\\nThe majority of these figures, however, are highly stylized representations of the female human form, typically having a flat, geometric quality which gives them a striking resemblance to today's modern art. However, this may be a modern misconception as there is evidence that the idols were originally brightly painted.[7] A majority of the figurines are female, depicted nude, and with arms folded across the stomach, typically with the right arm held below the left. Most writers who have considered these artifacts from an anthropological or psychological viewpoint have assumed that they are representative of a Great Goddess of nature, in a tradition continuous with that of Neolithic female figures such as the Venus of Willendorf.[8] Although some archeologists would agree,[9] this interpretation is not generally agreed on by archeologists, among whom there is no consensus on their significance. They have been variously interpreted as idols of the gods, images of death, children's dolls, and other things. One authority feels they were \\"more than dolls and probably less than sacrosanct idols.\\" [10]\\r\\nSuggestions that these images were idols in the strict sensecult objects which were the focus of ritual worshipare unsupported by any archeological evidence.[11] What the archeological evidence does suggest is that these images were regularly used in funerary practice: they have all been found in graves. Yet at least some of them show clear signs of having been repaired, implying that they were objects valued by the deceased during life and were not made specifically for burial. Furthermore, larger figures were sometimes broken up so that only part of them was buried, a phenomenon for which there is no explanation. The figures apparently were buried equally with both men and women.[12] Such figures were not found in every grave.[10] While the idols are most frequently found laid on their backs in graves, larger examples may have been set up in shrines or dwelling places.[13]\\r\\nEarly Cycladic art is divided into three periods: EC I (2800ÿ2500 BCE), EC II (2500ÿ2200 BCE), and EC III (2200ÿ2000 BCE). The art is by no means strictly confined to one of these periods, and in some cases, even representative of more than one of the Cycladic islands. The art of EC I is best represented on the islands of Paros, Antiparos, and Amorgos, while EC II is primarily seen on Syros, and EC III on Melos.[14]\\r\\nThe most important earliest groups of the GrottaÿPelos culture are Pelos, Plastiras and Louros. Pelos figurines are of schematic type. Both males and females, in standing position with a head and face, compose the Plastiras type; the rendering is naturalistic but also strangely stylized. The Louros type is seen as transitional, combining both schematic and naturalistic elements.[15][16] Schematic figures are more commonly found and are very flat in profile, having simple forms and lack a clearly defined head. Naturalistic figures are small and tend to have strange or exaggerated proportions, with long necks, angular upper bodies, and muscular legs. [17]\\r\\nThe Pelos type figurines are different than many other Cycladic figurines as for most the gender is undetermined. The most famous of the Pelos type figurines are the \\"violin\\"-shaped figurines. On these figurines there is an implied elongated head, no legs and a violin-shaped body. One particular \\"violin\\" figurine, has breasts, arms under the breasts, and a pubic triangle, possibly representing a fertility goddess. However, since not all the figurines share these characteristics, no accurate conclusion can be made at this time.\\r\\nThe Plastiras type is an early example of Cycladic figurines, named after the cemetery on Paros where they were found. [18] The figures retain the violin-like shape, stance, and folded arm arrangement of their predecessors but differ in notable ways. The Plastiras type is the most naturalistic type of Cycladic figurine, marked by exaggerated proportions. An ovoid head with carved facial features, including ears, sits atop an elongated neck that typically takes up a full third of the figure's total height. [19] The legs were carved separately for their entire length, often resulting in breakages. On female figures the pubic area is demarcated by an incision and the breasts are modeled. Representations of males differ in structure, but not remarkably, possessing narrower hips and carved representations of the male sexual organs. The figures are typically small in size, usually no larger than thirty centimeters, and are not able to stand on their own, as the feet are pointed. Surviving figurines have been carved from marble, but it is suggested by some that they may also have been carved from wood.\\r\\nThe Louros type is a category of Cycladic figurines from the Early Cycladic I phase of the Bronze Age. Combining the naturalistic and schematic approaches of earlier figure styles, the Louros type have featureless faces, a long neck, and a simple body with attenuated shoulders that tend to extend past the hips in width. The legs are shaped carefully but are carved to separation no further than the knees or mid-calves.[19] Though breasts are not indicated, figures of this type are still suggestive of the female form and tend to bear evidence of a carved pubic triangle.\\r\\nThe Kapsala variety is a type of Cycladic figure of the Early Cycladic II period. This variety is often thought to precede or overlap in period with that of the canonical Spedos variety of figures. Kapsala figures differ with the canonical type in that the arms are held much lower in the right-below-left folded configuration and the faces lack sculpted features other than the nose and occasionally ears.[19] Kapsala figures show a tendency of slenderness, especially in the legs, which are much longer and lack the powerful musculature suggested in earlier forms of the sculptures. The shoulders and hips are much narrower as well, and the figures themselves are very small in size, rarely larger than 30cm in length. Evidence suggests that paint is now regularly used to demarcate features such as the eyes and pubic triangle, rather than carving them directly. One characteristic of note of the Kapsala variety is that some figures seem to suggest pregnancy, featuring bulging stomachs with lines drawn across the abdomen. Like other figures of the Early Cycladic II period, the most defining feature of the Kapsala variety is their folded-arm position.\\r\\nThe Spedos type, named after an Early Cycladic cemetery on Naxos, is the most common of Cycladic figurine types. It has the widest distribution within the Cyclades as well as elsewhere, and the greatest longevity. The group as a whole includes figurines ranging in height from miniature examples of 8 cm to monumental sculptures of 1.5 m. With the exception of a statue of a male figure, now in the Museum of Cycladic Art Collection, all known works of the Spedos variety are female figures.[20] Spedos figurines are typically slender elongated female forms with folded arms. They are characterized by U-shaped heads and a deeply incised cleft between the legs.\\r\\nThe Dokathismata type is a Cycladic figure from the end of the Early Cycladic II period of the Bronze Age. With characteristics that are developed from the earlier Spedos variety, the Dokathismata figures feature broad, angular shoulders and a straight profile. Dokathismata figures are considered the most stylized of the folded-arm figures, with a long, elegant shape that displays a strong sense of geometry that is especially evident in the head, which features an almost triangular shape. These figures were somewhat conservatively built compared to earlier varieties, with a shallow leg cleft and connected feet.[19] Despite this, the figures were actually quite fragile and prone to breakage. The return of an incised pubic triangle is also noted in the Dokathismata variety of figures.\\r\\nThe Chalandriani variety is a type of Cycladic figure from the end of the Early Cycladic II period of the Bronze Age. Named for the cemetery on the island of Syros on which they were found, these figures are somewhat similar in style and mannerism to the Dokathismata variety that preceded them. Chalandriani figures, however, feature a more truncated shape in which the arms are very close to the pubic triangle and the leg cleft is only indicated by a shallow groove.[19]\\r\\nOne feature of note with the Chalandriani variety is that the strict right-below-left configuration found in previous figures seemed to have relaxed, as some sculptures have reversed arms or even abandonment of the folded position for one or both arms. The reclining position of previous figures is also challenged, as the feet are not always inclined and the legs are somewhat rigid. The shoulders were expanded even further from the Dokathismata variety and were quite susceptible to damage as the upper arms and shoulders are also the thinnest point of the sculpture. The head is triangular or shield-shaped with few facial features other than a prominent nose, connected to the body by a pyramidal-shaped neck. Like figures of the Dokathismata variety, some Chalandriani figures appear to be presented as pregnant. The defining feature of these figures is their bold and exaggerated indication of the shoulders and upper arms.\\r\\nKoumasa figurines, from the Early Minoan II cemetery at Koumasa on Crete, are very small and flat. The folded-arm figures typically have short legs and broad shoulders,[21] and were prone to breakage given their delicate build.[22]\\r\\nThe local clay proved difficult for artists to work with, and the pottery, plates, and vases of this period are seldom above mediocre.[14] Of some importance are the so-called 'frying pans', which emerged on the island of Syros during the EC II phase. Most scholars believe that these 'frying pans' were not used for cooking, but perhaps as fertility charms or mirrors.[23] Some zoological figurines and pieces depicting ships have also been found.\\r\\nBesides these, other forms of functional pottery have been found. All pottery of early Cycladic civilization was made by hand, and typically was a black or reddish color, though pottery of a pale buff has also been found. The most common shapes are cylindrical boxes, known as pyxides, and collared jars. [17] They are crude in construction, with thick walls and crumbling imperfections, but sometimes feature naturalistic designs reminiscent of the sea-based culture of the Aegean islands.","input":"What is the most common subject of cycladic sculptures?"},{"output":"relationship between best friends Will Truman (Eric McCormack), a gay lawyer, and Grace Adler (Debra Messing), a straight interior designer.","context":"Will & Grace is an American sitcom created by Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. Set in New York City, the show focuses on the relationship between best friends Will Truman (Eric McCormack), a gay lawyer, and Grace Adler (Debra Messing), a straight interior designer. The show was broadcast on NBC from September 21, 1998 to May 18, 2006, for a total of eight seasons, and restarted its run on NBC on September 28, 2017. During its original run, Will & Grace was one of the most successful television series with gay principal characters.[2]\\r\\nDespite initial criticism for its particular portrayal of homosexual characters, it went on to become a staple of NBC's Must See TV Thursday night lineup and was met with continued critical acclaim. It was ensconced in the Nielsen top 20 for half of its network run. The show was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18ÿ49, from 2001 and 2005. Throughout its eight-year run, Will & Grace earned 16 Emmy Awards and 83 nominations. Each main actor, with the exception of Morrison, received an Emmy Award throughout the series. In 2014 the Writers Guild of America placed the sitcom at number 94 in their list of the 101 Best Written TV series of all time.[3] Since the final episode aired, the sitcom has been credited with helping and improving public opinion of the LGBT community, with former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden commenting that the show \\"probably did more to educate the American public\\" on LGBT issues \\"than almost anything anybody has ever done so far\\".[4] In 2014, the Smithsonian Institution added an LGBT history collection to their museum which included items from Will and Grace. The curator Dwight Blocker Bowers stated that the sitcom used \\"comedy to familiarize a mainstream audience with gay culture\\" that was \\"daring and broke ground\\" in American media.[5]\\r\\nWill & Grace was filmed in front of a live studio audience (most episodes and scenes) on Tuesday nights,[6] at Stage 17 in CBS Studio Center, a space that totals 14,000?sq?ft (1,300?m2). Will and Grace's apartment is on display at the Emerson College Library, having been donated by series creator Max Mutchnick.[7] When the set was removed in April 2014, rumors came up about a cast reunion, but the actors involved denied that such a reunion was planned. It was merely moved to Emerson's new center in Los Angeles. A long-running legal battle between both the original executive producers and creators and NBC took place between 2003 and 2007. All seasons of the series have been released on DVD and the show has been broadcast in more than 60 countries.\\r\\nOn September 26, 2016, the cast reunited for a 10-minute special (released online), urging Americans to vote in the 2016 presidential election.[8] After the success of the 10-minute reunion special, NBC announced that the network was exploring the idea of putting Will & Grace back into production.[9] In January 2017, NBC confirmed the series' return, for a ten-episode ninth season, for the 2017ÿ18 television season.[10][11] The episode order was increased to 12 on April 5, 2017 and later to 16.[12] The season premiered on September 28, 2017.[13] On August 3, 2017, NBC renewed the series for a tenth season of 13 episodes.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWill & Grace is set in New York City and focuses on the relationship between Will Truman, a gay lawyer, and his best friend Grace Adler, a Jewish woman who owns an interior design firm. Also featured are their friends Karen Walker, an alcoholic socialite, and Jack McFarland, a flamboyantly gay actor. The interplay of relationships features the trials and tribulations of dating, marriage, divorce, and casual sex; as well as comical key stereotypes of gay and Jewish culture.\\r\\nCreators of Will & Grace and real-life friends Max Mutchnick and David Kohan modeled the show after Mutchnick's relationship with childhood friend Janet Eisenberg, a New York City voice-over casting agent. Mutchnick, who is openly gay, met Eisenberg while rehearsing a play at Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills, California at age of 13.[24] He was the main star of the Hebrew school musical, while she was a student in the drama department. About three years later, she introduced him to Kohan, the son of comedy writer Alan Kohan, in the drama department at Beverly Hills High School. \\"Max and Janet seemed to have a lovely rapport, but the romantic element confused me, and it confused them as well,\\" Kohan later recalled. \\"They went out for a couple of years, then they went off to different colleges. And Max comes out of the closet, springs it on her ÿ and she was stunned. It was a shocking revelation for her, so I kind of functioned as a liaison between the two of them, because they both still really loved each other.\\"[24]\\r\\nWhile Kohan practiced his shuttle diplomacy, he and Mutchnick began developing sitcom ideas, which prompted the pair to start writing as a duo.[24] They eventually landed staff jobs on HBO's adult-themed sitcom Dream On and executive produced the short-lived NBC sitcom Boston Common.[24] In 1997, they developed an ensemble comedy about six friends, two of them based on Mutchnick and Eisenberg.[24] At the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking another relationship comedy for the network as Mad About You was going off the air.[25][26] When Kohan and Mutchnick pitched their idea, which centered on three couples, one of which was a gay man living with a straight woman, Littlefield was not excited about the first two couples, but wanted to learn more about the gay and straight couple, so Mutchnick and Kohan were sent to create a pilot script centering on those two characters.[26] While Kohan and Mutchnick elaborated on the pilot script, they spent four tense months faxing Littlefield the box office grosses from hit films with gay characters such as The Birdcage and My Best Friend's Wedding.[24]\\r\\nNBC was positive about the project, but there was still some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen, which aired on ABC, was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became \\"too gay.\\"[27][28] Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres's coming out episode, \\"The Puppy Episode,\\" Kohan said, \\"there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace to make it on the air.\\" He added: \\"Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for 20 years. He's not exploring that awkward territory for the first time, as Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it.\\"[29]\\r\\nNBC went to sitcom director James Burrows to see what he thought of the homosexual subject matter and if an audience would be interested in the show.[31] Burrows liked the idea and when he first read the script in November 1997, he decided that he wanted to direct it. Burrows said, \\"I knew that the boys had captured a genre and a group of characters I have never read before.\\"[25] The filming of the pilot began in March 15, 1998. The actors behind Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, were positive about the series and they thought it had the potential to last long on television. McCormack said: \\"When shooting was finished that night, Debra and I were sitting on the couch and looking at each other and I said, Were gonna be on this set for a while. And we sort of clasped hands, but we didnt want to say anything beyond that and jinx it.\\"[32]\\r\\nThe part of Will Truman went to Eric McCormack, who was the first actor cast in the series.[30] Having played gay characters several times in his career, McCormack did not have a problem with it and thought his character could become a \\"poster boy for some gay movement\\", like DeGeneres became a spokesperson with her character.[33] Sean Hayes was invited to audition for Jack after a NBC casting executive saw him in a role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away and decided not to try out for the audition until he was sent the script again.[34] Megan Mullally initially auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, but admitted that she did not want to audition for the part of Karen.[35] By contrast, Debra Messing, with whom Mullally had first worked on Ned & Stacey, was initially unsure if she wanted to play the role of Grace.[36] The last actor to be cast, she later admitted that director Burrows was the reason for doing Will & Grace.[31]\\r\\nIn January 2017, NBC closed a deal for a new 10-episode season of the series, to air during the 2017-18 season. Hayes will executive produce this season as well as creators/executive producers Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. Veteran director James Burrows is on board to direct and executive produce.[37] In April 2017, the episode order was increased to 12 episodes.[38] In August 2017, it was extended again to 16 episodes, and a second 13-episode season was ordered.[39] The revival will also be filmed at Stage 22 at Universal Studios Hollywood as opposed to Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center.\\r\\nIn December 2003, in the midst of the series' sixth season, executive producers and creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick sued NBC and NBC Studios. Alleging that the network sold the rights to the series in an attempt to keep profits within the NBC family, Kohan and Mutchnick felt that they were cheated out of considerable profits by the network's not shopping of the show to the highest bidder. Another allegation against the network was that during the first four seasons of the series, the studio licensed the rights for amounts that were insufficient for covering production costs, thus leading to extraordinarily large production deficits.[40] Three months later, NBC filed a countersuit against Kohan and Mutchnick stating that the co-creators were expected to act as an independent third party in the negotiations between NBC and its subsidiary, NBC Studios (since subsumed into Universal Television).[41]\\r\\nWith a pending lawsuit and production beginning on other projects, Kohan and Mutchnick were absent on the Will & Grace set for most of its final seasons. They wrote the season 4 episode, \\"A Buncha White Chicks Sittin' Around Talkin'\\" and did not return to the writers' seat until the series finale four years later. Three years after NBC's countersuit and one year after the series ended, the legal battle between NBC and Kohan and Mutchnick ended in 2007 when all parties agreed on a settlement, with the series creators being awarded $49 million, of their original $65 million lawsuit.[42]\\r\\nWill & Grace entered off-network syndication in the fall of 2002 and aired locally till 2008. In 2002 WGN America acquired the cable rights to air the series, where it aired until 2005 when Lifetime Television acquired the cable rights to air the series. After eight years and the expiration of Lifetime's contract, the rights to the series were picked up by WeTV and Logo TV in the fall of 2013. The streaming service Hulu later picked up the show, in anticipation for the show's revival in the fall of 2017.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was aired on Channel 4 up until its season finale in 2006. No confirmation of the series returning to UK screens has yet been announced.\\r\\nThe show garnered a fair amount of criticism and negative reviews upon its debut in 1998, most of which compared the show to the recently canceled ABC sitcom Ellen. Some called it \\"a gay Seinfeld\\". One such review said, \\"If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little anomaly ÿ that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest in one another. But don't bet on it. If it's doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally.\\"[43] As popular as the show came to be, particularly among gay viewers, Will & Grace continuously dealt with criticism for having a limited view of the gay community and for reinforcing stereotypes when some felt it should have torn them down.[44]\\r\\nThe series finale was heavily promoted by NBC, and McCormack, Messing, Mullally and Hayes appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show and The Today Show to bid farewell, on May 10 and 18, respectively. NBC devoted a two-hour block in its primetime schedule on May 18, 2006, for the Will & Grace send-off. An hour-long series retrospective, \\"Say Goodnight, Gracie\\", featuring interviews with the cast, crew, and guest stars, preceded the hour-long series finale. Series creators and executive producers Kohan and Mutchnick, who had not served as writers since the season 4 finale, penned the script for \\"The Finale\\". Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated, \\"We wrote about what you want to have happen with people you love... All the things that matter in life, they end up having.\\"[45]\\r\\nThe ninth season was met with generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes the season has a rating of 86% based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The sites critical consensus reads, \\"Will & Grace reunites its ever-hilarious cast for a revival season that picks up right where the show left off 11 years ago -- adding a fresh relevance and a series of stories that make sharply funny use of the passage of time.\\"[46] On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[47]\\r\\nWill & Grace was nominated for 83 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning 16 of them. McCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally each won at least one Emmy Award for their respective performances. Mullally also won a second time for her performance in 2006, a year when Will & Grace was nominated for 10 Emmys for its final season. The year before, the show had garnered 15 nominations, tied with Desperate Housewives as the series receiving the most nominations. This was almost an all-time record; the two shows were second behind The Larry Sanders Show, with 16 nominations in 1996.\\r\\nWith three each, both Hayes and Mullally held the record of winning the most Screen Actors Guild Awards for the categories Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series and Best Performance by an Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively, for their roles in Will & Grace; however, Tina Fey went on to tie with Mullally and Alec Baldwin went on to surpass Hayes, both for their roles on the series 30 Rock. Will & Grace has won several GLAAD Media Awards for its advocacy of the gay community. Despite more than two dozen nominations, Will & Grace never won a Golden Globe Award.\\r\\nThe show debuted on Mondays beginning on September 21, 1998 and steadily gained in popularity, culminating when it moved to Thursday night as part of NBC's Must See TV line-up. The show ultimately became a highly rated television show in the United States, earning a top-twenty rating during four of its eight seasons, including one season at # 9. From 2001ÿ2005, Will & Grace was the highest-rated sitcom among adults 18ÿ49. However, when the show lost Friends as its lead-in after the 2003ÿ04 season, Will & Grace began shedding viewers and slipped out of the top 20 during its last two seasons.\\r\\n\\"The Finale\\" drew over 18 million viewers,[48][49] ranking # 8 for the week, easily making it the most watched episode of the final two seasons. While the series finale is considered a ratings success, it is far from being the most watched episode of Will & Gracethat accolade remains with the season four episode \\"A Chorus Lie\\", which aired on February 7, 2002 and ranked #8 for the week. When the show was at the height of its popularity (seasons 3ÿ5), ranking in the Top 10 was a common occurrence, but the finale's Top 10 rank was the only such rank for season 8 and the first such rank since the season 7 premiere \\"FYI: I Hurt, Too\\".\\r\\nThe series was the first prime-time television series on U.S. terrestrial television to star openly gay lead characters, making it the highest-profile presence of LGBT characters on U.S. broadcast television since Ellen's eponymous lead character's coming-out in the 1997 \\"Puppy Episode\\". It has also been heralded as responsible for opening the door to a string of gay-themed television programs, such as Queer as Folk, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and Boy Meets Boy.\\r\\nIn May 2012, during a Meet the Press interview with host David Gregory, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden cited the series as an influence in American thinking regarding LGBT rights, saying, \\"I think Will & Grace did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody has ever done. People fear that which is different. Now they're beginning to understand.\\"[58] In the same interview, Biden stated that he was \\"absolutely comfortable\\" with same-sex marriage, a statement which was followed on May 9 by President Barack Obama's speaking in favor of it.[59] The day after Obama's statement, series co-creator Mutchnick later told CBS This Morning that Biden had spoken similar words at a private function which Mutchnick and his husband had attended two weeks prior to Biden's statement, although a White House official was cited by CBS This Morning's Bill Plante as asserting that the Meet the Press interview was not a \\"trial balloon\\" for the statement.[60] Both Mutchnick and Kohan praised Biden's statement, but were critical of Obama's stance on marriage during the time between Biden's and Obama's statements.[61]\\r\\nIn 2004, the cast of the show were listed in Bravo's 100 Greatest TV Characters.[62] In 2012, The Washington Post ranked Will & Grace the ninth-best NBC comedy of all time.[63]\\r\\nIn 2014, scripts, props, and set decor from Will & Grace were donated to the National Museum of American History, which is part of the Smithsonian.[64]\\r\\nLionsgate Home Entertainment has released all eight seasons of Will & Grace on DVD in Region 1, 2 and 4. The show was re-released and re-packaged on October 3, 2011 on region 2.\\r\\nIt had been announced that Megan Mullally would be creating and starring in a new Broadway musical entitled Karen: The Musical. This musical would have had Mullally reprising her role of Karen Walker. She stated in an interview that the show may also involve recurring guest star Leslie Jordan in his role as Beverley Leslie, with a story revolving around their rivalry.[66]\\r\\nAccording to Mullally, the project was cancelled due to the rights to the Karen character being withdrawn. Mullally stated to have already gained approval from the network, as well as having the Broadway production company Fox Theatricals, director and choreographer Casey Nicholaw and composer Jeff Blumenkrantz all lined up to participate in the production, before certain stakeholders in the Karen Walker character withdrew the rights for its use in the production.[67]\\r\\nThere had been talk in 2008 that a spin-off was being developed by NBC entitled Jack & Karen, featuring Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally reprising their roles. Hayes initially showed interest in the spin-off but was ultimately put off by the short-lived Friends spin-off, Joey. Furthermore, Mullally's new work schedule in the form of her talk show, which was canceled several months later, did not allow her to pursue the spin-off at the time.[68]\\r\\nOn September 26, 2016, the main castMcCormack, Messing, Hayes, and Mullally, plus Morrison in a cameo rolereunited for a 10-minute web special, urging Americans to vote in the 2016 presidential election.[8] In the special, Karen, an avid Donald Trump supporter, tries to persuade Jack to vote for Trump, while Will and Grace, both avid Hillary Clinton supporters, try to persuade him to vote for Clinton. At the end, Will reveals that singer Katy Perry is a supporter of Clinton, which persuades Jack to vote for Clinton.","input":"What is the story of will and grace?"},{"output":"Dol Jatra","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoli ( /?ho?li?/; Sanskrit: ???? Holؐ), also known as the \\"festival of colours\\", is a spring festival celebrated all across the Indian subcontinent as well as in countries with large Indian subcontinent diaspora populations such as Jamaica,[7] Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Mauritius, and Fiji.[8][1][9] It signifies the victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring, end of winter, and for many a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.[10][11] It is also celebrated as a thanksgiving for a good harvest.[10][11] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon day) falling in the Vikram Samvat Hindu Calendar [12] month of Phalguna, which falls somewhere between the end of February and the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. The first evening is known as Holika Dahan or Chhoti Holi and the following day as Holi, Rangwali Holi, Dhuleti, Dhulandi,[13] or Phagwah.[14]\\r\\nHoli is an ancient Hindu religious festival which has become popular with non-Hindus in many parts of South Asia, as well as people of other communities outside Asia.[10] In recent years the festival has spread to parts of Europe and North America as a spring celebration of love, frolic, and colours.[15][16][17]\\r\\nHoli celebrations start on the night before Holi with a Holika Dahan where people gather, perform religious rituals in front of the bonfire, and pray that their internal evil be destroyed the way Holika, the sister of the demon king Hiranyakashipu, was killed in the fire. The next morning is celebrated as Rangwali Holi ÿ a free-for-all festival of colours,[10] where people smear each other with colours and drench each other. Water guns and water-filled balloons are also used to play and colour each other. Anyone and everyone is fair game, friend or stranger, rich or poor, man or woman, children and elders. The frolic and fight with colours occurs in the open streets, open parks, outside temples and buildings. Groups carry drums and other musical instruments, go from place to place, sing and dance. People visit family, friends and foes to throw coloured powders on each other, laugh and gossip, then share Holi delicacies, food and drinks.[18][19] Some customary drinks include bhang (made from cannabis), which is intoxicating.[20][21] In the evening, after sobering up, people dress up and visit friends and family.[5][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a symbolic legend to explain why Holi is celebrated as a festival of colours in the honour of Hindu god Vishnu and his follower Prahlada. King Hiranyakashipu, according to a legend found in chapter 7 of Bhagavata Purana,[22][23] was the king of demonic Asuras, and had earned a boon that gave him five special powers: he could be killed by neither a human being nor an animal, neither indoors nor outdoors, neither at day nor at night, neither by astra (projectile weapons) nor by any shastra (handheld weapons), and neither on land nor in water or air. Hiranyakashipu grew arrogant, thought he was God, and demanded that everyone worship only him.[5]\\r\\nHiranyakashipu's own son, Prahlada, however, disagreed. He was and remained devoted to Vishnu.[18] This infuriated Hiranyakashipu. He subjected Prahlada to cruel punishments, none of which affected the boy or his resolve to do what he thought was right. Finally, Holika, Prahlada's evil aunt, tricked him into sitting on a pyre with her.[5] Holika was wearing a cloak that made her immune to injury from fire, while Prahlada was not. As the fire roared, the cloak flew from Holika and encased Prahlada,[18] who survived while Holika burned. Vishnu, the god who appears as an avatar to restore Dharma in Hindu beliefs, took the form of Narasimha - half human and half lion, at dusk (when it was neither day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which was neither indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which was neither land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which were neither a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon).[24]\\r\\nThe Holika bonfire and Holi signifies the celebration of the symbolic victory of good over evil, of Prahlada over Hiranyakashipu, and of the fire that burned Holika.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Braj region of India, where the Hindu deity Krishna grew up, the festival is celebrated until Rangpanchmi in commemoration of the divine love of Radha for Krishna. The festivities officially usher in spring, with Holi celebrated as a festival of love.[25] There is a symbolic myth behind commemorating Krishna as well. As a baby, Krishna developed his characteristic dark skin colour because the she-demon Putana poisoned him with her breast milk.[26] In his youth, Krishna despaired whether the fair-skinned Radha and other girls would like him because of his skin colour. His mother, tired of the desperation, asks him to approach Radha and colour her face in any colour he wanted. This he does, and Radha and Krishna became a couple. Ever since, the playful colouring of Radha's face has been commemorated as Holi.[27][28] Beyond India, these legends to explain the significance of Holi (Phagwah) are common in some Caribbean and South American communities of Indian origin such as Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.[29][30] It is also celebrated with great fervour in Mauritius.[31]\\r\\nAmong other Hindu traditions such as Shaivism and Shaktism, the legendary significance of Holi is linked to Shiva in yoga and deep meditation, goddess Parvati wanting to bring back Shiva into the world, seeks help from the Hindu god of love called Kama on Vasant Panchami. The love god shoots arrows at Shiva, the yogi opens his third eye and burns Kama to ashes. This upsets both Kama's wife Rati (Kamadevi) and his own wife Parvati. Rati performs her own meditative asceticism for forty days, upon which Shiva understands, forgives out of compassion and restores the god of love. This return of the god of love, is celebrated on the 40th day after Vasant Panchami festival as Holi.[32][33] The Kama legend and its significance to Holi has many variant forms, particularly in South India.[34]\\r\\nThe Holi festival has a cultural significance among various Hindu traditions of the Indian subcontinent. It is the festive day to end and rid oneself of past errors, to end conflicts by meeting others, a day to forget and forgive. People pay or forgive debts, as well as deal anew with those in their lives. Holi also marks the start of spring, for many the start of the new year, an occasion for people to enjoy the changing seasons and make new friends.[11][35]\\r\\nThe festival has traditionally been also observed by non-Hindus, such as by Jains[2] and Newar Buddhists (Nepal).[3]\\r\\nSikhs have traditionally celebrated the festival, at least through the 19th century,[36] with its historic texts referring to it as Hola.[37] Guru Gobind Singh ÿ the last human guru of the Sikhs ÿ modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.[38][39][40]\\r\\nHoli was observed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his Sikh Empire that extended across what are now northern parts of India and Pakistan. According to a report by Tribune India, Sikh court records state that 300 mounds of colours were used in 1837 by Ranjit Singh and his officials in Lahore. Ranjit Singh would celebrate Holi with others in the Bilawal gardens, where decorative tents were set up. In 1837, Sir Henry Fane who was the commander-in-chief of the British Indian army joined the Holi celebrations organised by Ranjit Singh. A mural in the Lahore Fort was sponsored by Ranjit Singh and it showed the Hindu god Krishna playing Holi with gopis. After the death of Ranjit Singh, his Sikh sons and others continued to play Holi every year with colours and lavish festivities. The colonial British officials joined these celebrations.[41]\\r\\nHoli is an important spring festival for Hindus, a national holiday in India and Nepal with regional holidays in other countries. To many Hindus and some non-Hindus, it is a playful cultural event and an excuse to throw coloured water at friends or strangers in jest. It is also observed broadly in the Indian subcontinent. Holi is celebrated at the end of winter, on the last full moon day of the Hindu luni-solar calendar month marking the spring, making the date vary with the lunar cycle.[note 1] The date falls typically in March, but sometimes late February of the Gregorian calendar.[44][45]\\r\\nThe festival has many purposes; most prominently, it celebrates the beginning of Spring. In 17th century literature, it was identified as a festival that celebrated agriculture, commemorated good spring harvests and the fertile land.[10] Hindus believe it is a time of enjoying spring's abundant colours and saying farewell to winter. To many Hindus, Holi festivities mark the beginning of the new year as well as an occasion to reset and renew ruptured relationships, end conflicts and rid themselves of accumulated emotional impurities from the past.[11][35]\\r\\nIt also has a religious purpose, symbolically signified by the legend of Holika. The night before Holi, bonfires are lit in a ceremony known as Holika Dahan (burning of Holika) or Little Holi. People gather near fires, sing and dance. The next day, Holi, also known as Dhuli in Sanskrit, or Dhulheti, Dhulandi or Dhulendi, is celebrated.\\r\\nIn Northern parts of India, Children and youth spray coloured powder solutions (gulal) at each other, laugh and celebrate, while adults smear dry coloured powder (abir) on each other's faces.[5][35] Visitors to homes are first teased with colours, then served with Holi delicacies (such as puranpoli, dahi-bada and gujia), desserts and drinks.[19][47][48] After playing with colours, and cleaning up, people bathe, put on clean clothes, and visit friends and family.[11]\\r\\n Like Holika Dahan, Kama Dahanam is celebrated in some parts of India. The festival of colours in these parts is called Rangapanchami, and occurs on the fifth day after Poornima (full moon).[49]\\r\\nThe Holi festival is an ancient Hindu festival with its cultural rituals. It is mentioned in the Puranas, Dasakumara Charita, and by the poet Klidsa during the 4th century reign of Chandragupta II.[8] The celebration of Holi is also mentioned in the 7th-century Sanskrit drama Ratnavali.[50] The festival of Holi caught the fascination of European traders and British colonial staff by the 17th century. Various old editions of Oxford English Dictionary mention it, but with varying, phonetically derived spellings: Houly (1687), Hooly (1698), Huli (1789), Hohlee (1809), Hoolee (1825), and Holi in editions published after 1910.[10]\\r\\nThere are several cultural rituals associated with Holi:[51]\\r\\nMain article: Holika Dahan\\r\\nDays before the festival people start gathering wood and combustible materials for the bonfire in parks, community centers, near temples and other open spaces. On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify Holika who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as gujiya, mathri, malpuas and other regional delicacies.\\r\\nOn the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying Holika Dahan. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People gather around the fire to sing and dance.[11]\\r\\nHoli frolic and celebrations begin the morning after the Holika bonfire. There is no tradition of holding puja (prayer), and the day is for partying and pure enjoyment. Children and young people form groups armed with dry colours, coloured solution and water guns (pichkaris), water balloons filled with coloured water, and other creative means to colour their targets.[51]\\r\\nTraditionally, washable natural plant-derived colours such as turmeric, neem, dhak, and kumkum were used, but water-based commercial pigments are increasingly used. All colours are used. Everyone in open areas such as streets and parks is game, but inside homes or at doorways only dry powder is used to smear each other's face. People throw colours and get their targets completely coloured up. It is like a water fight, but with coloured water. People take delight in spraying coloured water on each other. By late morning, everyone looks like a canvas of colours. This is why Holi is given the name \\"Festival of Colours\\".\\r\\nGroups sing and dance, some playing drums and dholak. After each stop of fun and play with colours, people offer gujiya, mathri, malpuas and other traditional delicacies.[53] Cold drinks, including adult drinks based on local intoxicating herbs,[21] are also part of the Holi festivity.\\r\\nIn the Braj region around Mathura, in north India, the festivities may last more than a week. The rituals go beyond playing with colours, and include a day where men go around with shields and women have the right to playfully beat them on their shields with sticks.[54]\\r\\nIn south India, some worship and make offerings to Kaamadeva, the love god of Indian mythology.\\r\\nAfter a day of play with colours, people clean up, wash and bathe, sober up and dress up in the evening and greet friends and relatives by visiting them and exchanging sweets. Holi is also a festival of forgiveness and new starts, which ritually aims to generate harmony in the society.[51]\\r\\nHoli (Hindi: ????, Marathi: ????, Nepali: ????, Punjabi: ????, Kannada: ????, Telugu: ????) is also known as Phakuwa or Phagwah (Assamese: ??????), Festival of Colours, or Dola jtra in Odisha, and as Dol Jatra (Assamese: ?? ??????) or Basanto utsav (\\"spring festival\\") in West Bengal and Assam. The customs and celebrations vary between regions of India.\\r\\nHoli is of particular significance in the Braj region, which includes locations traditionally associated with the Lord Krishna: Mathura, Vrindavan, Nandgaon, Uttar Pradesh, and Barsana, which become touristic during the season of Holi.[25]\\r\\nOutside India and Nepal, Holi is observed by the minority Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan as well in countries with large Indian subcontinent diaspora populations such as Suriname, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Mauritius, and Fiji. The Holi rituals and customs outside South Asia also vary with local adaptations.\\r\\nIn Gujarat, Holi is a two-day festival. On the evening of the first day people light the bonfire. People offer raw coconut and corn to the fire. The second day is the festival of colour or \\"Dhuleti\\", celebrated by sprinkling coloured water and applying colours to each other. Dwarka, a coastal city of Gujarat, celebrates Holi at the Dwarkadheesh temple and with citywide comedy and music festivities.[55] Falling in the Hindu month of Phalguna, Holi marks the agricultural season of the rabi crop.\\r\\nIn Ahmedabad in Gujarat, in western India, a pot of buttermilk is hung high over the streets and young boys try to reach it and break it by making human pyramids. The girls try to stop them by throwing coloured water on them to commemorate the pranks of Krishna and the cowherd boys to steal butter and \\"gopis\\" while trying to stop the girls. The boy who finally manages to break the pot is crowned the Holi King. Afterwards, the men, who are now very colourful, go out in a large procession to \\"alert\\" people of Krishna's possible appearance to steal butter from their homes.\\r\\nIn some places there is a custom in undivided Hindu families that the woman beats her brother-in-law with a sari rolled up into a rope in a mock rage and tries to drench him with colours, and in turn, the brother-in-law brings sweets (Indian desserts) to her in the evening.[56]\\r\\nBarsana, a town near Mathura in the Braj region of Uttar Pradesh, celebrates Lath mar Holi in the sprawling compound of the Radha Rani temple. Thousands gather to witness the Lath Mar Holi when women beat up men with sticks as those on the sidelines become hysterical, sing Holi songs and shout \\"Sri Radhey\\" or \\"Sri Krishna\\". The Holi songs of Braj mandal are sung in pure Braj, the local language. Holi celebrated at Barsana is unique in the sense that here women chase men away with sticks. Males also sing provocative songs in a bid to invite the attention of women. Women then go on the offensive and use long staves called lathis to beat the men, who protect themselves with shields.[citation needed]\\r\\nMathura, in the Braj region, is the birthplace of Lord Krishna. In Vrindavan this day is celebrated with special puja and the traditional custom of worshipping Lord Krishna; here the festival lasts for sixteen days.[25] All over the Braj region [57] and neighboring places like Hathras, Aligarh, and Agra, Holi is celebrated in more or less the same way as in Mathura, Vrindavan and Barsana.\\r\\nA traditional celebration includes Matki Phod, similar to Dahi Handi in Maharashtra and Gujarat during Krishna Janmashtami, both in the memory of god Krishna who is also called makhan chor (literally, butter thief). This is a historic tradition of the Braj region as well as the western region of India.[58] An earthen pot filled with butter or other milk products is hung high by a rope. Groups of boys and men climb on each other's shoulder to form pyramids to reach and break it, while girls and women sing songs and throw coloured water on the pyramid to distract them and make their job harder.[59] This ritual sport continues in Hindu diaspora communities.[60]\\r\\nOutside Braj, in the Kanpur area, Holi lasts seven days with colour. On the last day, a grand fair called Ganga Mela or the Holi Mela is celebrated. This Mela (fair) was started by freedom fighters who fought British rule in the First Indian War of Independence in 1857 under the leadership of Nana Saheb. The Mela is held at various ghats along the banks of the River Ganga in Kanpur, to celebrate the Hindus and Muslims who together resisted the British forces in the city in 1857. On the eve of Ganga Mela, all government offices, shops, and courts generally remain closed. The Ganga Mela marks the official end of \\"The Festival of Colours\\" or Holi in Kanpur.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Gorakhpur, the northeast district of Uttar Pradesh, the day pig Holi starts with a special puja. This day, called \\"Holi Milan\\", is considered to be the most colourful day of the year, promoting brotherhood among the people. People visit every house and sing Holi songs and express their gratitude by applying coloured powder (Abeer). It is also considered the beginning of the year, as it occurs on the first day of the Hindu calendar year (Panchang).[citation needed]\\r\\nKumaoni Holi in Uttarakhand includes a musical affair. It takes different forms such as the Baithki Holi, the Khari Holi and the Mahila Holi. In Baithki Holi and Khari Holi, people sing songs with a touch of melody, fun and spiritualism. These songs are essentially based on classical ragas. Baithki Holi (????? ????), also known as Nirvan Ki Holi, begins from the premises of temples, where Holiyars (???????) sing Holi songs and people gather to participate, along with playing classical music. The songs are sung in a particular sequence depending on the time of day; for instance, at noon the songs are based on Peelu, Bhimpalasi and Sarang ragas, while evening songs are based on the ragas such as Kalyan, Shyamkalyan and Yaman. The Khari Holi (???? ????) is mostly celebrated in the rural areas of Kumaon. The songs of the Khari Holi are sung by the people, who, sporting traditional white churidar payajama and kurta, dance in groups to the tune of ethnic musical instruments such as the dhol and hurka.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the Kumaon region, the Holika pyre, known as Cheer (???), is ceremonially built in a ceremony known as Cheer Bandhan (??? ????) fifteen days before Dulhendi. The Cheer is a bonfire with a green Paiya tree branch in the middle. The Cheer of every village and neighborhood is rigorously guarded as rival mohallas try to playfully steal each other's cheer.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe colours used on Holi are derived from natural sources. Dulhendi, known as Charadi (?????) (from Chharad (????)), is made from flower extracts, ash and water. Holi is celebrated with great gusto much in the same way all across North India.[61]\\r\\nHoli is known as Phaguwa in the local Bhojpuri dialect. In this region as well, the legend of Holika is prevalent. On the eve of Phalgun Poornima, people light bonfires. They put dried cow dung cakes, wood of the Araad or Redi tree and Holika tree, grains from the fresh harvest and unwanted wood leaves in the bonfire. At the time of Holika people assemble near the pyre. The eldest member of the gathering or a purohit initiates the lighting. He then smears others with colour as a mark of greeting. Next day the festival is celebrated with colours and a lot of frolic. Traditionally, people also clean their houses to mark the festival.[citation needed]\\r\\nHoli Milan is also observed in Bihar, where family members and well wishers visit each other's family, apply colours (abeer) on each other's faces, and on feet, if elderly. Usually this takes place on the evening of Holi day after Holi with wet colours is played in the morning through afternoon. Due to large-scale internal migration issues faced by the people, recently this tradition has slowly begun to transform, and it is common to have Holi Milan on an entirely different day either before or after the actual day of Holi.[citation needed]\\r\\nChildren and youths take extreme delight in the festival. Though the festival is usually celebrated with colours, in some places people also enjoy celebrating Holi with water solutions of mud or clay. Folk songs are sung at high pitch and people dance to the sound of the dholak (a two-headed hand-drum) and the spirit of Holi. Intoxicating bhang, made from cannabis, milk and spices, is consumed with a variety of mouth-watering delicacies, such as pakoras and thandai, to enhance the mood of the festival.[62]\\r\\nThe people of Odisha celebrate \\"Dola\\" on the day of Holi where the icons of Jagannath replace the icons of Krishna and Radha. Dola Melana, processions of the deities are celebrated in villages and bhoga is offered to the deities. \\"Dola yatra\\" was prevalent even before 1560 much before Holi was started where the idols of Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra used to be taken to the \\"Dolamandapa\\" (podium in Jagannath temple).[64] People used to offer natural colours known as \\"abira\\" to the deities and apply on each other's feats.[65]\\r\\nIn West Bengal, Holi is known by the name of \\"Dol Jatra\\", \\"Dol Purnima\\" or the \\"Swing Festival\\". The festival is celebrated in a dignified manner by placing the icons of Krishna and Radha on a picturesquely decorated palanquin which is then taken round the main streets of the city or the village. On the Dol Purnima day in the early morning, students dress up in saffron-coloured or pure white clothes and wear garlands of fragrant flowers. They sing and dance to the accompaniment of musical instruments, such as the ektara, dubri, and veena. The devotees take turns to swing them while women dance around the swing and sing devotional songs. During these activities, the men keep spraying coloured water and coloured powder, abir, at them.\\r\\nThe head of the family observes a fast and prays to Lord Krishna and Agnidev, the fire God.[citation needed] After all the traditional rituals are over, he smears Krishna's icon with gulal and offers \\"bhog\\" to both Krishna and Agnidev. In Shantiniketan, Holi has a special musical flavour. Visitors on Holi are offered traditional dishes that include malpoa, kheer sandesh, basanti sandesh (saffron), saffron milk, payash, and related foods.\\r\\nHoli, also called Phakuwa (??????) in Assamese, is celebrated all over Assam. Locally called Dol Jatra, associated with Satras of Barpeta, Holi is celebrated over two days. On the first day, the burning of clay huts are seen in Barpeta and lower Assam which signifies the legends of Holika. On the second day of it, Holi is celebrated with colour powders. The Holi songs in chorus devoted to Lord Krishna are also sung in the regions of Barpeta.\\r\\nHoli is locally called Ukkuli in Konkani. It is celebrated around the Konkani temple called Gosripuram temple. It is a part of the Goan or Konkani spring festival known as ?igmo or ????? in Ko?ka?ؐ or ?i?irotsava, which lasts for about a month. The colour festival or Holi is a part of longer, more extensive spring festival celebrations.[66] Holi festivities (but not ?igmo festivities) include: Holika Puja and Dahan, Dhulvad or Dhuli vandan, Haldune or offering yellow and saffron colour or Gulal to the deity.\\r\\nIn Maharashtra, Holi Purnima is also celebrated as Shimga, festivities that last five to seven days. A week before the festival, youngsters go around the community, collecting firewood and money. On the day of Shimga, the firewood is heaped into a huge pile in each neighborhood. In the evening, the fire is lit. Every household brings a meal and dessert, in the honour of the fire god. Puran Poli is the main delicacy and children shout \\"Holi re Holi puranachi poli\\". Shimga celebrates the elimination of all evil. The colour celebrations here take place on the day of Rang Panchami, five days after Shimga. During this festival, people are supposed to forget and forgive any rivalries and start new healthy relations with all.\\r\\nManipuris celebrate Holi for 6 days. Here, this holiday merges with the festival of Yaosang. Traditionally, the festival commences with the burning of a thatched hut of hay and twigs. Young children go from house to house to collect money, locally known as nakadeng (or nakatheng), as gifts on the first two days. The youths at night perform a group folk dance called Thabal chongba on the full moon night of Lamta (Phalgun), traditionally accompanied by folk songs and rhythmic beats of the indigenous drum, but nowadays by modern bands and fluorescent lamps. In Krishna temples, devotees sing devotional songs, perform dances and celebrate with aber (gulal) wearing traditional white and yellow turbans. On the last day of the festival, large processions are taken out to the main Krishna temple near Imphal where several cultural activities are held. In recent decades, Yaosang, a type of Indian sport, has become common in many places of the valley, where people of all ages come out to participate in a number of sports that are somewhat altered for the holiday.\\r\\nTraditionally, in rural Karnataka children collect money and wood in the weeks prior to Holi, and on \\"Kamadahana\\" night all the wood is put together and lit. The festival is celebrated for two days. People in northern parts of Karnataka prepare special food on this day.\\r\\nIn Sirsi, Karnataka, Holi is celebrated with a unique folk dance called \\"Bedara Vesha\\", which is performed during the nights beginning five days before the actual festival day. The festival is celebrated every alternate year in the town, which attracts a large number of tourists from different parts of the India.[67]\\r\\nAs in other parts of India, in rural Telangana, children celebrate kamuda and collect money, rice, corn and wood for weeks prior to Holi, and on Kamudha night all the wood is put together and set on fire.\\r\\nHindus celebrate Holi as it relates to the legend of Kama Deva. Holi is known by three names: Kamavilas, Kaman Pandigai and Kama-Dahanam[68][69][70][71]\\r\\nIn Jammu & Kashmir, Holi celebrations are much in line with the general definition of Holi celebrations: a high-spirited festival to mark the beginning of the harvesting of the summer crop, with the throwing of coloured water and powder and singing and dancing.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Punjab, Holi is preceded by Holika Dahan the night before. On the day of Holi, people engage in throwing colours[72] on each other.[73] For locals, Holi marks the end of winter. The Punjabi saying 'Phaggan phal laggan' (Phagun is the month for fructifying) exemplifies the seasonal aspect of Holi. Trees and plants start blossoming from the day of Basant and start bearing fruit by Holi.[74]\\r\\nDuring Holi in Punjab, walls and courtyards of rural houses are enhanced with drawings and paintings similar to rangoli in South India, mandana in Rajasthan, and rural arts in other parts of India. This art is known as chowk-poorana or chowkpurana in Punjab and is given shape by the peasant women of the state. In courtyards, this art is drawn on cloth. The art includes drawing tree motifs, flowers, ferns, creepers, plants, peacocks, palanquins, geometric patterns along with vertical, horizontal and oblique lines. These arts add to the festive atmosphere.[75]\\r\\nFolk theatrical performances known as swang or nautanki take place during Holi,[76] with the latter originating in the Punjab.[77]\\r\\nHoli, along with many other Hindu festivals, is celebrated in Nepal as a national festival. It is an important major Nepal-wide festival along with Dashain and Tihar (Dipawali).[78] It is celebrated in the Nepali month of Phagun (same date as Indian Holi), and signifies the legends of the Hindu god Krishna.[78] Newar Buddhists and others worship Saraswati shrine in Vajrayogini temples and celebrate the festival with their Hindu friends.[79] Traditional concerts are held in most cities in Nepal, including Kathmandu, Narayangarh, Pokhara, Hetauda, and Dharan, and are broadcast on television with various celebrity guests.\\r\\nPeople walk through their neighbourhoods to celebrate Holi by exchanging colours and spraying coloured water on one another. A popular activity is the throwing of water balloons at one another, sometimes called lola (meaning water balloon).[80] Many people mix bhang in their drinks and food, as is also done during Shivaratri. It is believed that the combination of different colours at this festival takes all sorrow away and makes life itself more colourful.\\r\\nOver the years, Holi has become an important festival in many regions wherever Indian diaspora were either taken as indentured labourers during colonial era, or where they emigrated on their own, and are now present in large numbers such as in Africa, North America, Europe, Latin America, and parts of Asia such as Fiji.[16][17][81][82]\\r\\nHoli is a national holiday in Suriname. It is called Phagwa festival, and is celebrated to mark the beginning of spring and Hindu mythology. In Suriname, Holi Phagwa is a festival of colour. It is customary to wear old white clothes on this day, be prepared to get them dirty and join in the colour throwing excitement and party.[83][84]\\r\\nPhagwa is normally celebrated in Trinidad and Tobago on the Sunday closest to the actual date of Phagwah. It is celebrated with a lot of colour and splendour, along with the singing on traditional Phagwah songs or Chowtal (gana).\\r\\nPhagwah is a national holiday in Guyana, and peoples of all races and religions participate in the celebrations.[85] The main celebration in Georgetown is held at the Mandir in Prashad Nagar.[86]\\r\\nIndo-Fijians celebrate Holi as festival of colours, folksongs and dances. The folksongs sung in Fiji during Holi season are called phaag gaaian. Phagan, also written as Phalgan, is the last month of the Hindu calendar. Holi is celebrated at the end of Phagan. Holi marks the advent of spring and ripening of crops in Northern India. Not only it is a season of romance and excitement, folk songs and dances, it is also an occasion of playing with powder, perfumes and colours. Many of the Holi songs in Fiji are around the theme of love-relationship between Radha and Krishna.[87]\\r\\nHoli in Mauritius comes close on the heels of Shivaratri. It celebrates the beginning of spring, commemorating good harvests and the fertile land. Hindus believe it is a time of enjoying springs abundant colours and saying farewell to winter. It is considered one of the most exhilarating religious holidays in existence. During this event, participants hold a bonfire, throw coloured powder at each other, and celebrate wildly.[88]\\r\\nHoli is celebrated in many US states. It is usually hosted in temples or cultural halls. Members of Hindu associations and volunteers assist in hosting the event along with temple devotees. Some of the places known to celebrate Holi are New Brunswick (NJ), Spanish Fork (Utah), Houston (TX), Dallas (TX), South El Monte (CA), Boston (MA), Potomac (MD), and Chicago (IL).[citation needed]\\r\\nHoli is celebrated by Pakistani Hindus, in various cities in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh, such as Karachi,[89] Hazara,[90] Rawalpindi, Sindh, Hyderabad, Multan and Lahore.[91] Locals in Multan associate Holi and Prahlada[92] with the Prahlada-Puri Temple.[93][94]\\r\\nHoli was not a public holiday in Pakistan from 1947 to 2016. Holi along with Diwali for Hindus, and Easter for Christians, was adopted as public holiday resolution by Pakistan's parliament in 2016, giving the local governments and public institutions the right to declare Holi as a holiday and grant leave for its minority communities, for the first time.[95] This decision has been controversial, with some Pakistanis welcoming the decision, while others criticising it, with the concern that declaring Holi a public holiday advertises a Hindu festival to Pakistani children.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spring season, during which the weather changes, is believed to cause viral fever and cold. The playful throwing of natural coloured powders, called gulal has a medicinal significance: the colours are traditionally made of Neem, Kumkum, Haldi, Bilva, and other medicinal herbs prescribed by yurvedic doctors.\\r\\nMany colours are obtained by mixing primary colours. Artisans produce and sell many of the colours from natural sources in dry powder form, in weeks and months preceding Holi. Some of the traditional natural plant based sources of colours are:[10][97][98]\\r\\nThe flowers of palash or tesu tree, also called the flame of the forest, are typical source of bright red and deep orange colours. Powdered fragrant red sandal wood, dried hibiscus flowers, madder tree, radish and pomegranate are alternate sources and shades of red. Mixing lime with turmeric powder creates an alternate source of orange powder, as does boiling saffron (kesar) in water.\\r\\nMehendi and dried leaves of gulmohur tree offer a source of green colour. In some areas, the leaves of spring crops and herbs have been used as source of green pigment.\\r\\nHaldi (turmeric) powder is the typical source of yellow colour. Sometimes this is mixed with chickpeas, gram or other flour to get the right shade. Bael fruit, amaltas, species of chrysanthemums, and species of marigold are alternate sources of yellow.\\r\\nIndigo plant, Indian berries, species of grapes, blue hibiscus and jacaranda flowers are traditional sources of blue colour for Holi.\\r\\nBeetroot is the traditional source of magenta and purple colour. Often these are directly boiled in water to prepare coloured water.\\r\\nDried tea leaves offer a source of brown coloured water. Certain clays are alternate source of brown.\\r\\nSpecies of grapes, fruits of amla (gooseberry) and vegetable carbon (charcoal) offer gray to black colours.\\r\\nNatural colours were used in the past to celebrate Holi safely by applying turmeric, sandalwood paste, extracts of flowers and leaves. As the spring-blossoming trees that once supplied the colours used to celebrate Holi have become more rare, chemically produced industrial dyes have been used to take their place in almost all of urban India. Due to the commercial availability of attractive pigments, slowly the natural colours are replaced by synthetic colours. As a result, it has caused mild to severe symptoms of skin irritation and inflammation. Lack of control over the quality and content of these colours is a problem, as they are frequently sold by vendors who do not know their origin.\\r\\nA 2007 study found that malachite green, a synthetic bluish-green dye used in some colours during Holi festival, was responsible for severe eye irritation in Delhi, if eyes were not washed upon exposure. Though the study found that the pigment did not penetrate through the cornea, malachite green is of concern and needs further study.[99]\\r\\nAnother 2009 study reports that some colours produced and sold in India contain metal-based industrial dyes, causing an increase in skin problems to some people in the days following Holi. These colours are produced in India, particularly by small informal businesses, without any quality checks and are sold freely in the market. The colours are sold without labeling, and the consumer lacks information about the source of the colours, their contents, and possible toxic effects. In recent years, several nongovernmental organisations have started campaigning for safe practices related to the use of colours. Some are producing and marketing ranges of safer colours derived from natural sources such as vegetables and flowers.[100]\\r\\nThese reports have galvanised a number of groups into promoting more natural celebrations of Holi. Development Alternatives, Delhi and Kalpavriksh,[101] ÿ Kalpavriksh Environment Action Group, Pune, The CLEAN India campaign[102] and Society for Child Development, through its Avacayam Cooperative Campaign[103] have launched campaigns to help children learn to make their own colours for Holi from safer, natural ingredients. Meanwhile, some commercial companies such as the National Botanical Research Institute have begun to market \\"herbal\\" dyes, though these are substantially more expensive than the dangerous alternatives. However, it may be noted that many parts of rural India have always resorted to natural colours (and other parts of festivities more than colours) due to availability.\\r\\nIn urban areas, some people wear nose mask and sun glasses to avoid inhaling pigments and to prevent chemical exposure to eyes.[104]\\r\\nAn alleged environmental issue related to the celebration of Holi is the traditional Holika bonfire, which is believed to contribute to deforestation. Activists estimate Holika causes 30,000 bonfires every year, with each one burning approximately 100 kilograms (220.46 lbs) of wood.[105] This represents less than 0.0001% of 350 million tons of wood India consumes every year, as one of the traditional fuels for cooking and other uses.[106]\\r\\nThe use of heavy metal-based pigments during Holi is also reported to cause temporary wastewater pollution, with the water systems recovering to pre-festival levels within 5 days.[107]\\r\\nIn June 2015, hundreds of concert-goers in Bali District, Taiwan were severely injured in the Formosa Fun Coast explosion, including fifteen who died later in hospital,[108] after three tons of corn starch powder mixed with food colouring was sprayed onto the crowd at a high velocity, causing a massive explosion.[109]\\r\\nThe method of powder application at the concert created \\"an extremely dense dust cloud over the stage and its immediate vicinity\\".[110] People near the stage were standing ankle deep in coloured corn starch powder and the powder was suspended into the air using air blowers as well as compressed gas canisters.[111][112] Initial investigations into the explosion showed the ignition of the suspended corn starch powder was likely caused by a cigarette or spark. An Asia One report[113] states that such an explosion can occur, under certain conditions, not just with corn starch but with powder form of any agricultural product such as \\"powdered milk, soya flour, cornflour, rice dust, spice powders, sugar, tapioca, cocoa powder, coconut shell dust, coffee dust, garlic powder, grass dust, malted hops, lemon peel dust, oat flour, peanut skins, tea and tobacco\\", and that \\"the crucial element is not the composition of the powder itself, but whether it's deployed under high pressure with a flame nearby.\\"[113]\\r\\nAccording to Williamson, flammable powder or dust suspended in air in high concentrations is explosive.[113][114] Williamson notes that \\"dust cloud explosions can only occur if the dust concentration is within certain limits. In general the lowest concentration of dust that can give a dust explosion is around 50-100 g/m3 and the maximum is 2-3 kg/m3. These limits are dependent on the particular chemical in question. It is usually easy to see if a cloud is explosible, as visibility through a dust cloud - even at the lowest concentrations - is impaired.\\"[115]\\r\\nDuring traditional Holi celebrations in India, Rinehart writes, colours are exchanged in person by \\"tenderly applying coloured powder to another person's cheek\\", or by spraying and dousing others with buckets of coloured water.[116]\\r\\nHoli is celebrated as a social event in parts of the United States.[122] For example, at Sri Sri Radha Krishna Temple in Spanish Fork, Utah, NYC Holi Hai in Manhattan, New York[123] and Festival of Colors: Holi NYC in New York City, New York,[122][124] Holi is celebrated as the Festival of Color, where thousands of people gather from all over the United States, play and mingle.[4][122][125]\\r\\nA number of Holi-inspired social events have also surfaced, particularly in Europe and the United States, often organised by companies as for-profit or charity events with paid admission, and with varying scheduling that does not coincide with the actual Holi festival. These have included Holi-inspired music festivals such as the Festival Of Colours Tour and Holi One[126] (which feature timed throws of Holi powder), and 5K run franchises such as The Color Run, Holi Run and Color Me Rad,[127] in which participants are doused with the powder at per-kilometre checkpoints.[128][129] The BiH Color Festival is a Holi-inspired electronic music festival held annually in Br?ko, Bosnia and Herzegovina. [130][131]\\r\\nThere have been concerns that these events appropriate and trivialise aspects of Holi for commercial gaindownplaying or completely ignoring the cultural and spiritual roots of the celebration.[128][129] Organisers of these events have argued that the costs are to cover various key aspects of their events, such as safe colour powders, safety and security, and entertainment.[129]","input":"By what name is holi known in west bengal and orissa?"},{"output":"The Heroes of Olympus","context":"The Heroes of Olympus is a pentalogy of adventure, mythological fiction and fantasy novels written by American author Rick Riordan that collectively form a sequel series to the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series.[1] This series details a conflict between Greek and Roman demigods and Gaea, the earth goddess. Riordan introduces Roman mythology into his sequel series as well as several new characters. The first book of the series, The Lost Hero, was published on October 12, 2010.[2] The final entry in the series, The Blood of Olympus, was published on October 7, 2014.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plot of the Heroes of Olympus is centered around a prophecy, introduced in The Last Olympian, that predicted seven demigods would unite to protect the earth from Gaea. Demigods from both the Greek camp, Camp Half-Blood, and a newfound Roman camp, Camp Jupiter, work together to save the world from being destroyed by Gaea. The prophecy reads:\\r\\nSeven half-bloods shall answer the call,\\r\\nTo storm or fire, the world must fall.\\r\\nAn oath to keep with a final breath,\\r\\nAnd foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.\\r\\nThe Lost Hero, the first book in the Heroes of Olympus series, was released on October 12, 2010 as a hardcover, audiobook, and ebook.[4] The initial publishing run consisted of 2.5 million copies.[5] The book's official publication was preceded by several \\"sneak-peek\\" releases by Disney-Hyperion.[6] A graphic novel version, adapted and illustrated by Orpheus Collar, was released October 7, 2014.[7][8]\\r\\nThe novel begins by introducing Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez, three newly-discovered demigods who travel to Camp Half-Blood. In response to a prophecy, they set off on a quest to prevent the rebirth of the giant king Porphyrion and rescue Piper's father, who has been kidnapped by another giant, Enceladus. Jason, who has amnesia, also begins to remember pieces of his past throughout the book - most importantly, that he comes from a Roman camp for demigods called Camp Jupiter. Camp Half-Blood resolves to seek out this other camp both to gain allies in the fight against Gaea, the giants' mother and commander, and to locate the missing Percy Jackson.[9]\\r\\nThe novel was a number one bestseller on the lists of The New York Times,[10] USA Today,[11] The Wall Street Journal,[12] and Publishers Weekly.[13]. Many critics praised the novel as a good follow-up to Riordan's previous series. A review by The Epoch Times commented, \\"If anyone was afraid that Riordan couldnt top his Percy Jackson seriesthey can quit worrying. This new series, even though in the same genre as the Percy Jackson group, has fresh ideas, more mystery and magic and keeps the reader engrossed from start to finish.\\"[14] Despite this praise, some reviews were more mixed. Vicky Smith of Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"[there are] far too many pages of stretched-out action, telling not showing and awkward dialogue...Unless Riordan tightens things up considerably by number five, [readers] may find themselves hoping that it does not end with a third Great Prophecy\\".[15]\\r\\nThe Lost Hero won the Barnes & Noble Best Book of 2010 award and was a Massachusetts Children's Book Award Honor book for 2014, among other honors.[16][17] Rick Riordan was named \\"Author of the Year\\" for the novel at the 2011 Children's Choice Awards.[18][19] The book was also recommended by the ALA Best Fiction for Young Adults list of 2012.[17][20]\\r\\nThe Son of Neptune, the second book in the Heroes of Olympus series, was released on October 4, 2011.\\r\\nThe novel opens with Percy Jackson (stricken with amnesia) discovering Camp Jupiter and meeting several Roman demigods. After a prophecy from Mars, he, Frank Zhang, and Hazel Levesque travel to Alaska to stop the rise of the giant Alcyoneus and free the god Thanatos, whom the giant has captured. After successfully completing their mission, the group returns to Camp Jupiter to defend it from yet another giant, Polybotes, and his army. After repelling this invasion, the demigods from Camp Jupiter go to meet the delegation from Camp Half-Blood arriving in the flying ship known as the Argo II.[21]\\r\\nThe Mark of Athena, the third book, was released on October 2, 2012.\\r\\nAfter the Argo II unintentionally fires on Camp Jupiter, the seven demigods of the \\"Prophecy of Seven\\" - Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, Hazel Levesque, Frank Zhang, Jason Grace, Piper McLean, and Leo Valdez - rush to escape the angered Roman campers. They travel to Rome following the Mark of Athena, a magical talisman designed to lead children of Athena (like Annabeth) to the missing Athena Parthenos. During their journey, they hear that Nico di Angelo has been captured by the Aloadae, and go to rescue him. Although they successfully free the son of Hades and locate the statue, Annabeth and Percy are pulled into Tartarus and the rest of the group resolves to find some way to save them.[22]\\r\\nThe House of Hades, the fourth book, was released on October 8, 2013.\\r\\nIn Tartarus, Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase travel towards the \\"Doors of Death\\" (the only exit to the mortal world) with help from Bob the Titan, hoping to escape and simultaneously stop more monsters from getting through.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles (1919), which formally ended the war, Germany accepted responsibility for the damages caused in the war and was obliged to pay war reparations to the various Allies, principally France. The total sum of reparations demanded from Germanyaround 226 billion gold marks (US $859 billion in 2017)was decided by an Inter-Allied Reparations Commission. In 1921, the amount was reduced to 132 billion (at that time, $31.4 billion (US $442 billion in 2017), or S6.6 billion (UK S284 billion in 2017)).[1] Even with the reduction, the debt was huge. As some of the payments were in industrial raw materials, German factories were unable to function, and the German economy suffered, further damaging the country's ability to pay.[2]\\r\\nBy late 1922, the German defaults on payments had grown so regular that a crisis engulfed the Reparations Commission; the French and Belgian delegates urged occupying the Ruhr as a way of forcing Germany to pay more, while the British delegate urged a lowering of the payments.[3] As a consequence of a German default on timber deliveries in December 1922, the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, which led to the Franco-Belgian occupation of the Ruhr in January 1923.[4] Particularly galling to the French was that the timber quota the Germans defaulted on was based on an assessment of their capacity the Germans made themselves and subsequently lowered.[5] The Allies believed that the government of Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno had defaulted on the timber deliveries deliberately as a way of testing the will of the Allies to enforce the treaty.[5] The entire conflict was further exacerbated by a German default on coal deliveries in early January 1923, which was the thirty-fourth coal default in the previous thirty-six months.[6] The French Premier Raymond Poincar was deeply reluctant to order the Ruhr occupation and took this step only after the British had rejected his proposals for non-military sanctions against Germany.[7] Frustrated at Germany not paying reparations, Poincar hoped for joint Anglo-French economic sanctions against Germany in 1922 and opposed military action. However, by December 1922 he was faced with Anglo-American-German opposition and saw coal for French steel production and payments in money as laid out in the Treaty of Versailles draining away. Poincar was exasperated with British opposition, and wrote to the French ambassador in London:\\r\\nJudging others by themselves, the English, who are blinded by their loyalty, have always thought that the Germans did not abide by their pledges inscribed in the Versailles Treaty because they had not frankly agreed to them. ... We, on the contrary, believe that if Germany, far from making the slightest effort to carry out the treaty of peace, has always tried to escape her obligations, it is because until now she has not been convinced of her defeat. ... We are also certain that Germany, as a nation, resigns herself to keep her pledged word only under the impact of necessity.[8]\\r\\nPoincar decided to occupy the Ruhr on 11 January 1923 to extract the reparations himself. The real issue during the Ruhrkampf (Ruhr struggle), as the Germans labelled the battle against the French occupation, was not the German defaults on coal and timber deliveries but the sanctity of the Versailles Treaty.[9] Poincar often argued to the British that letting the Germans defy Versailles in regards to the reparations would create a precedent that would lead to the Germans dismantling the rest of the Versailles treaty.[10] Finally, Poincar argued that once the chains that had bound Germany in Versailles were destroyed, it was inevitable that Germany would plunge the world into another world war.[10]\\r\\nInitiated by French Prime Minister Raymond Poincar, the invasion took place on 11 January 1923. General Alphonse Carons 32nd infantry corps under the supervision of General Jean-Marie Degoutte carried out the operation.[11] Some theories state that the French aimed to occupy the centre of German coal, iron, and steel production in the Ruhr area valley simply to get the money. Some others state that France did it to ensure that the reparations were paid in goods, because the Mark was practically worthless because of hyperinflation that already existed at the end of 1922. France had the iron ore and Germany had the coal. Each state wanted free access to the resource it was short of, as together these resources had far more value than separately. (Eventually this problem was resolved in the post-World War II European Coal and Steel community.)\\r\\nFollowing France's decision to invade the Ruhr,[12] the Inter-Allied Mission for Control of Factories and Mines (MICUM)[13] was set up as a means of ensuring coal repayments from Germany.[14]\\r\\nThe occupation was greeted by a campaign of passive resistance. Approximately 130 German civilians were killed by the French occupation army during the events, including during civil disobedience protests, e.g. against dismissal of German officials.[15][16] Some theories assert that to pay for passive resistance in the Ruhr, the German government began the hyperinflation that destroyed the German economy in 1923.[9] Others state that the road to hyperinflation was well established before with the reparation payments that started on November 1921,[17] see 1920s German inflation. In the face of economic collapse, with high unemployment and hyperinflation, the strikes were eventually called off in September 1923 by the new Gustav Stresemann coalition government, which was followed by a state of emergency. Despite this, civil unrest grew into riots and coup attempts targeted at the government of the Weimar Republic, including the Beer Hall Putsch. The Rhenish Republic was proclaimed at Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle) in October 1923.\\r\\nThough the French did succeed in making their occupation of the Ruhr pay, the Germans through their passive resistance in the Ruhr and the hyperinflation that wrecked their economy, won the world's sympathy, and under heavy Anglo-American financial pressure (the simultaneous decline in the value of the franc made the French very open to pressure from Wall Street and the City), the French were forced to agree to the Dawes Plan of April 1924, which substantially lowered German reparations payments.[18] Under the Dawes Plan, Germany paid only 1 billion marks in 1924, and then increasing amounts for the next three years, until the total rose to 2.25 billion marks by 1927.\\r\\nInternationally the French invasion of Germany did much to boost sympathy for the German Republic although no action was taken in the League of Nations since it was technically legal under the Treaty of Versailles.[19] The French, with their own economic problems, eventually accepted the Dawes Plan and withdrew from the occupied areas in July and August 1925. The last French troops evacuated Dsseldorf and Duisburg along with the city's important harbour in Duisburg-Ruhrort, ending French occupation of the Ruhr region on 25 August 1925. According to Sally Marks, the occupation of the Ruhr \\"was profitable and caused neither the German hyperinflation, which began in 1922 and ballooned because of German responses to the Ruhr occupation, nor the franc's 1924 collapse, which arose from French financial practices and the evaporation of reparations\\".[20] Marks suggests the profits, after Ruhr-Rhineland occupation costs, were nearly 900 million gold marks.[21]\\r\\nDespite his disagreements with Britain, Poincar desired to preserve the Anglo-French entente and thus moderated his aims to a degree. His major goal was the winning of the extraction of reparations payments from Germany. His inflexible methods and authoritarian personality led to the failure of his diplomacy.[22]\\r\\nWhen on 12 July 1922, Germany demanded a moratorium on reparation payments, tension developed between the French government of Raymond Poincar and the Coalition government of David Lloyd George. The British Labour Party demanded peace and denounced Lloyd George as a troublemaker. It saw Germany as the martyr of the postwar period and France as vengeful and the principal threat to peace in Europe. The tension between France and Britain peaked during a conference in Paris in early 1923, by which time the coalition led by Lloyd George had been replaced by the Conservatives. The Labour Party opposed the occupation of the Ruhr throughout 1923, which it rejected as French imperialism. The British Labour Party believed it had won when Poincar accepted the Dawes Plan in 1924.[23]\\r\\nTo deal with the implementation of the Dawes Plan, a conference took place in London in JulyÿAugust 1924.[24] The British Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, who viewed reparations as impossible to pay, successfully pressured the French Premier douard Herriot into a whole series of concessions to Germany.[24] The British diplomat Sir Eric Phipps commented that The London Conference was for the French 'man in the street' one long Calvary as he saw M. Herriot abandoning one by one the cherished possessions of French preponderance on the Reparations Commission, the right of sanctions in the event of German default, the economic occupation of the Ruhr, the French-Belgian railroad Rgie, and finally, the military occupation of the Ruhr within a year.[25] The Dawes Plan was significant in European history as it marked the first time that Germany had succeeded in defying Versailles, and revised an aspect of the treaty in its favour.\\r\\nThe Saar region remained under French control until 1935.\\r\\nIn German politics, the French occupation of the Rhineland accelerated the formation of right-wing parties. Disoriented by the defeat in the war, conservatives in 1922 founded a consortium of nationalist associations, the \\"Vereinigten Vaterl?ndischen Verb?nde Deutschlands\\" (VVVD, United Patriotic Associations of Germany). The goal was to forge a united front of the right. In the climate of national resistance against the French Ruhr invasion, the VVVD reached its peak strength. It advocated policies of uncompromising monarchism, corporatism and opposition to the Versailles settlement. However, it lacked internal unity and money and so it never managed to unite the right before it had faded away by the late 1920s, as the Nazis emerged.[26]","input":"What was the french occupation of the ruhr?"},{"output":"always faithful","context":"Semper fidelis is a Latin phrase that means \\"always faithful\\" or \\"always loyal\\". It is the motto of the United States Marine Corps usually shortened to Semper fi. It is also in use as a motto for towns, families, schools, and military units.\\r\\nThe earliest definitively recorded use of semper fidelis is as the motto of the French town of Abbeville since 1369. It has also been used by other towns, and is recorded as the motto of various European families since the 16th century, and possibly since the 13th century or earlier. Records show many families in England, France and Ireland using this motto.\\r\\nThe earliest recorded use of semper fidelis by a military unit is by the Duke of Beaufort's Regiment of Foot, raised in south-western England in 1685. This is apparently linked to its use as a motto by the city of Exeter since no later than 1660. Subsequently, a variety of military organizations adopted the motto.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis phrase was used in Europe, at least in Great Britain, Ireland and France and probably in other countries as well.

A large portion of these families were Irish or Scottish.\\r\\nChassant and Tausin (1878, p.?647)[7] list the following French families as using it: D'Arbaud of Jonques, De Bronis, Chevalier of Pontis, Du Golinot of Mauny, De Coynart, De Genibrouse of Gastelpers, Macar of the Province of Liege, Milet of Mureau, Navoir of Ponzac, De Piomelles, De Poussois, De Reymons, and De Rozerou of Mos.\\r\\nThe city of Abbeville in France is recorded by 19th century sources (such as Chassant and Taussin, 1878) as using the motto \\"Semper fidelis,\\" and recent sources[8] state that the city was accorded this motto by Charles V, by letters patent of 19 June 1369, issued at Vincennes. This would make it the earliest recorded user of the motto among cities. However both Louandre (1834, p.?169)[9] and the city's current official website[10] give the motto simply as \\"Fidelis\\", and Sanson (1646, p.?15)[11] claimed that even this was not part of Charles's original grant, but was added later, sometime in the 14th to 17th centuries.\\r\\nIn 1658, Pope Alexander VII declared the city to be Semper fidelis, in recognition of the its key role in defending Europe and Roman Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\\r\\nToday, in Poland, the motto is referenced mainly in connection with the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1919 following the collapse of Austro-Hungary in the wake of World War I, and more especially in connection with the Polish-Bolshevik War that followed.\\r\\nIn Ukraine, the phrase is used much less, and refers to the survival of the Ukrainian Church through the period of Soviet persecution.\\r\\nThe City of Exeter, in Devon, England, has used the motto since at least 1660, when it appears in a manuscript of the local chronicler, Richard Izacke. Izacke claimed that the motto was adopted in 1588 to signify the city's loyalty to the English Crown. According to Izacke, it was Queen Elizabeth I who suggested that the city adopt this motto (perhaps in imitation of her own motto, Semper eadem, \\"Ever the same\\"); her suggestion is said to have come in a letter to \\"the Citizens of Exeter,\\" in recognition of their gift of money toward the fleet that had defeated the Spanish Armada. John Hooker's map of Exeter of around 1586 shows the city's coat of arms without the motto, suggesting that the city's use of the motto is no older than this. However the city archives do not hold any letter relating to the motto, and Grey (2005) argues that the Elizabethan origin of the motto may be no more than a local myth, since it is not recorded in contemporary chronicles, and that it may have been adopted at the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy to compensate for the city's less than total loyalty to the crown during the English Civil War.\\r\\nVarious bodies associated with the city of Exeter also use the motto:\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is the motto of the town of St. Malo, in Brittany, France. The date of its adoption is not known, but it appears to have been in use in the 17th century,[13] replacing an earlier motto, \\"Cave canem\\".\\r\\n\\"Civitas Calvi Semper Fidelis\\" may have been the motto of the city of Calvi, Balagna area in Corsica for 500 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\"Semper Fidelis\\" is the motto of the city of White Plains, in New York, United States.\\r\\nThe south-western English town of Exeter has used the motto semper fidelis since no later than 1660, inspiring its use by several south-western English military units.\\r\\nIn 1685 the motto was used by Duke of Beaufort when The Duke of Beaufort's Regiment of Foot, or Beaufort Musketeers, were raised to defend Bristol against the Duke of Monmouth's rebellion. It was numbered as the 11th Regiment of Foot when the numerical system of regimental designation was adopted in 1751 and was designated the regiment for North Devonshire.\\r\\nThe 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Rifle Volunteer Corps, raised in Exeter in 1852, was using the motto on its cap badge by 1860 at the latest; the Illustrated London News reported its use in its 7 January 1860 issue.[14] The motto was continued by The Devonshire Regiment of the British Army.\\r\\nThe motto was further continued on the badges of the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment when the Devonshires were amalgamated into them in 1958. This use of the motto evidently derives from these regiments' close connection with the city of Exeter, where they had a base from their foundation (see the Illustrated London News article referenced above) until their disappearance by amalgamation into the Rifles in 2007.\\r\\nThe Irish units in France used a similar motto, \\"Semper et ubique Fidelis\\", meaning \\"Always and Everywhere Faithful\\". These units, forming the Irish Brigade, were raised in 1690-1 under the terms of the Treaty of Limerick, which ended the war between King James II and King William III in Ireland and Britain. As the native Irish army in exile, \\"Semper et ubique Fidelis\\" was a reference to their fidelity to the Catholic faith, King James II, and to the king of France. For decades the Irish Brigade served as an independent army within the French army, remaining \\"Always and Everywhere Faithful\\" to their native Irish traditions (such as having the men elect their own officers, unheard of in France and England).\\r\\nWalsh's regiment of the Irish Brigade is noted for aiding the American cause in the American Revolution, when they were assigned as marines to John Paul Jones's ship, the Bonhomme Richard.[15]\\r\\nThe involvement of Irish Brigade soldiers serving as marines in the American War of Independence may have inspired the adoption of the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" by the US Marines. This would be ironic since the Irish Brigade motto referred specifically to their loyalty to Catholicism and Catholic kings, while the American rebels were fighting for a republican form of government for a largely Protestant population.\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Semper Fidelis\\" was made the official motto of the Marine Corps by Charles Grymes McCawley, the eighth Commandant of the Marine Corps, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which had a large Irish Catholic population. McCawley owed his commission[16] to Senator Pierre Soule of Louisiana a Catholic, born and raised in France, who would have been well aware of the Irish Brigade's service as Marines during the American Revolution.[17]\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is the motto of the cadets corps of the Dutch Royal Military Academy.[18] The corps was founded on 24 November 1828.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is also the motto of the 11th Infantry Regiment, which was founded in May 1861 by President Abraham Lincoln. It served as part of the Army of Ohio and later in the Indian wars, SpanishÿAmerican War, 1916 Mexican Border war, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam war. Today the regiment trains young Army officers at Fort Benning, Georgia.\\r\\n\\"Semper fidelis\\" is the motto of The West Nova Scotia Regiment (of the Canadian Forces), formed in 1936. It inherited the motto from The Lunenburg Regiment, formed in 1870.\\r\\nThe United States Marine Corps adopted the motto \\"Semper Fidelis\\" in 1883, on the initiative of Colonel Charles McCawley (29 January 1827 ÿ 13 October 1891), the 8th Commandant of the Marine Corps.[19]\\r\\nThere were three mottos prior to Semper Fidelis including Fortitudine (meaning \\"with courage\\") antedating the War of 1812, Per Mare, Per Terram (\\"by sea, by land\\"; presumably inherited from the British Royal Marines, who have that as a motto), and, up until 1843, there was also the Marines' Hymn motto \\"To the Shores of Tripoli\\". \\"Semper fidelis\\" signifies the dedication and loyalty that individual Marines have for 'Corps and Country', even after leaving service.

One variety, the coast Douglas fir, grows along the Pacific Ocean from central British Columbia south to central California. A second variety, the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, grows in the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia south to Mexico. The tree is dominant in western Washington. It is extensively used for timber, worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe common name honors David Douglas, a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus Abies. For this reason the name is often written as Douglas-fir (a name also used for the genus Pseudotsuga as a whole).[2]\\r\\nThe specific epithet, menziesii, is after Archibald Menzies, a Scottish physician and rival naturalist to David Douglas. Menzies first documented the tree on Vancouver Island in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as Doug-fir or as Douglas pine (although the latter common name may also refer to Pinus douglasiana).\\r\\nOne Coast Salish name for the tree, used in the Halkomelem language, is l:yelhp.[3]\\r\\nDouglas firs are medium-size to extremely large evergreen trees, 20ÿ100 metres (70ÿ330?ft) tall (although only coast Douglas firs reach such great height).[4] The leaves are flat, soft, linear, 2ÿ4 centimetres (0.8ÿ1.6?in) long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in fascicles; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. Douglas firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\\r\\nThe female cones are pendulous, with persistent scales unlike true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) bract that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).\\r\\nOne variety, coast Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), grows in the coastal regions, from west-central British Columbia southward to central California. In Oregon and Washington, its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the Cascades west to the Pacific Coast Ranges and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the Klamath and California Coast Ranges as far south as the Santa Lucia Range, with a small stand as far south as the Purisima Hills in Santa Barbara County.[5][6] In the Sierra Nevada, it ranges as far south as the Yosemite region. It occurs from near sea level along the coast to 1,800?m (5,900?ft) above sea level in the mountains of California.\\r\\nFurther inland, coast Douglas fir is replaced by another variety, Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas fir (P.?menziesii var. glauca). Interior Douglas fir intergrades with coast Douglas fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases. Mexican Douglas fir (P.?lindleyana), which ranges as far south as Oaxaca, is often considered a variety of P. menziesii.\\r\\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils.[7] However, Douglas fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas fir will generate deeper taproots. Interior Douglas fir exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas fir is capable.\\r\\nMature or \\"old-growth\\" Douglas fir forest is the primary habitat of the red tree vole (Arborimus longicaudus) and the spotted owl (Strix occidentalis). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400?ha (4 square kilometres, 990 acres) of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas fir trees. Nests are located 2ÿ50 metres (5ÿ165?ft) above the ground. The red vole's diet consists chiefly of Douglas fir needles. A parasitic plant sometimes utilizing P. menziesii is Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium douglasii).\\r\\nThe leaves are also used by the woolly conifer aphid Adelges cooleyi; this 0.5?mm long sap-sucking insect is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \\"fluff spots\\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage it causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among Lepidoptera, apart from some that feed on Pseudotsuga in general (see there) the gelechiid moths Chionodes abella and C. periculella as well as the cone scale-eating tortrix moth Cydia illutana have been recorded specifically on P. menziesii.\\r\\nThe coast Douglas fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the Pacific Northwest, occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than Rocky Mountain Douglas fir. Associated trees include western hemlock, Sitka spruce, sugar pine, western white pine, ponderosa pine, grand fir, coast redwood, western redcedar, California incense-cedar, Lawson's cypress, tanoak, bigleaf maple and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the Umpqua River in Oregon.\\r\\nPoriol is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by P. menziesii in reaction to infection by Poria weirii.[8]\\r\\nThis plant has ornamental value in large parks and gardens.[9]\\r\\nAway from its native area, it is also extensively used in forestry as a plantation tree for timber in Europe, New Zealand, Chile and elsewhere. It is also naturalised throughout Europe,[10] Argentina and Chile (called Pino Oreg܇n), and in New Zealand sometimes to the extent of becoming an invasive species (termed a wilding conifer) subject to control measures.\\r\\nThe buds have been used to flavor eau de vie, a clear, colorless fruit brandy.[11]\\r\\nNative Hawaiians built wa? kaulua (double-hulled canoes) from coast Douglas fir logs that had drifted ashore.[12]","input":"Who is the douglas fir tree named after?"},{"output":"cradle of civilization","context":"The Fertile Crescent (also known as the \\"cradle of civilization\\") is a crescent-shaped region where agriculture and early human civilization like Ancient Egypt flourished due to inundations from the surrounding Nile, Euphrates, and Tigris rivers.[1] Technological advances in the region include the development of writing, glass, the wheel, agriculture, and the use of irrigation.\\r\\nModern-day countries with significant territory within the Fertile Crescent are Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, as well as the southeastern fringe of Turkey and the western fringes of Iran.[2][3] The term is also used in international geopolitics and diplomatic relations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Fertile Crescent\\" was popularized by archaeologist James Henry Breasted in Outlines of European History (1914) and Ancient Times, A History of the Early World (1916).[4][5][6][7][8][9] Breasted wrote:[4]\\r\\nThis fertile crescent is approximately a semicircle, with the open side toward the south, having the west end at the southeast corner of the Mediterranean, the center directly north of Arabia, and the east end at the north end of the Persian Gulf (see map, p. 100). It lies like an army facing south, with one wing stretching along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean and the other reaching out to the Persian Gulf, while the center has its back against the northern mountains. The end of the western wing is Palestine; Assyria makes up a large part of the center; while the end of the eastern wing is Babylonia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis great semicircle, for lack of a name, may be called the Fertile Crescent.1 It may also be likened to the shores of a desert-bay, upon which the mountains behind look downa bay not of water but of sandy waste, some eight hundred kilometres across, forming a northern extension of the Arabian desert and sweeping as far north as the latitude of the northeast corner of the Mediterranean. This desert-bay is a limestone plateau of some heighttoo high indeed to be watered by the Tigris and Euphrates, which have cut ca?ons obliquely across it. Nevertheless, after the meager winter rains, wide tracts of the northern desert-bay are clothed with scanty grass, and spring thus turns the region for a short time into grasslands. The history of Western Asia may be described as an age-long struggle between the mountain peoples of the north and the desert wanderers of these grasslandsa struggle which is still going onfor the possession of the Fertile Crescent, the shores of the desert-bay.\\r\\n\\r\\n1 There is no name, either geographical or political, which includes all of this great semicircle (see map, p. 100). Hence we are obliged to coin a term and call it the Fertile Crescent.\\r\\nIn current usage, the Fertile Crescent includes Iraq, Kuwait, and surrounding portions of Iran and Turkey, as well as the rest of the Levantine coast of the Mediterranean Sea, Syria, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon. Water sources include the Jordan River. The inner boundary is delimited by the dry climate of the Syrian Desert to the south. Around the outer boundary are the Anatolian highlands to the north and the Sahara Desert to the west.\\r\\nAs crucial as rivers and marshlands were to the rise of civilization in the Fertile Crescent, they were not the only factor. The area is geographically important as the \\"bridge\\" between Africa and Eurasia, which has allowed it to retain a greater amount of biodiversity than either Europe or North Africa, where climate changes during the Ice Age led to repeated extinction events when ecosystems became squeezed against the waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The Saharan pump theory posits that this Middle Eastern land-bridge was extremely important to the modern distribution of Old World flora and fauna, including the spread of humanity.\\r\\nThe area has borne the brunt of the tectonic divergence between the African and Arabian plates and the converging Arabian and Eurasian plates, which has made the region a very diverse zone of high snow-covered mountains.\\r\\nThe Fertile Crescent had many diverse climates, and major climatic changes encouraged the evolution of many \\"r\\" type annual plants, which produce more edible seeds than \\"K\\" type perennial plants. The region's dramatic variety in elevation gave rise to many species of edible plants for early experiments in cultivation. Most importantly, the Fertile Crescent was home to the eight Neolithic founder crops important in early agriculture (i.e., wild progenitors to emmer wheat, einkorn, barley, flax, chick pea, pea, lentil, bitter vetch), and four of the five most important species of domesticated animalscows, goats, sheep, and pigs; the fifth species, the horse, lived nearby.[10] The Fertile Crescent flora comprises a high percentage of plants that can self-pollinate, but may also be cross-pollinated.[11] These plants, called \\"selfers\\", were one of the geographical advantages of the area because they did not depend on other plants for reproduction.[10]\\r\\nFertile Crescent\\r\\nMesopotamia\\r\\nEgypt\\r\\nPersia\\r\\nAnatolia\\r\\nThe Levant\\r\\nAs well as possessing many sites with the skeletal and cultural remains of both pre-modern and early modern humans (e.g., at Tabun and Es Skhul caves in Israel), later Pleistocene hunter-gatherers, and Epipalaeolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers (the Natufians); the Fertile Crescent is most famous for its sites related to the origins of agriculture. The western zone around the Jordan and upper Euphrates rivers gave rise to the first known Neolithic farming settlements (referred to as Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), which date to around 9,000 BCE (and includes sites such as G?bekli Tepe and Jericho).\\r\\nThis region, alongside Mesopotamia (which lies to the east of the Fertile Crescent, between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates), also saw the emergence of early complex societies during the succeeding Bronze Age. There is also early evidence from the region for writing and the formation of hierarchical statelevel societies. This has earned the region the nickname \\"The cradle of civilization\\".\\r\\nIt is in this region where the first libraries appeared, some 5,000 years ago. The oldest known library was found in northern Syria, in the ruins of Ebla, a major commercial center that was destroyed around 1650 BCE.[12]\\r\\nBoth the Tigris and Euphrates start in the Taurus Mountains of what is modern-day Turkey. Farmers in southern Mesopotamia had to protect their fields from flooding each year, except northern Mesopotamia which had just enough rain to make some farming possible. To protect against flooding, they made levees.[13]\\r\\nSince the Bronze Age, the region's natural fertility has been greatly extended by irrigation works, upon which much of its agricultural production continues to depend. The last two millennia have seen repeated cycles of decline and recovery as past works have fallen into disrepair through the replacement of states, to be replaced under their successors. Another ongoing problem has been salination  gradual concentration of salt and other minerals in soils with a long history of irrigation.\\r\\nPrehistoric seedless figs were discovered at Gilgal I in the Jordan Valley, suggesting that fig trees were being planted some 11,400 years ago.[14] Cereals were already grown in Syria as long as 9,000 years ago.[15] Small cats (Felis silvestris) also were domesticated in this region.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nLinguistically, the Fertile Crescent was a region of great diversity. Historically, Semitic languages generally prevailed in the lowlands, whilst in the mountainous areas to the east and north a number of generally unrelated languages were found including Elamite, Kassite, and Hurro-Urartian. The precise affiliation of these, and their date of arrival, remain topics of scholarly discussion. However, given lack of textual evidence for the earliest era of prehistory, this debate is unlikely to be resolved in the near future.\\r\\nThe evidence which does exist suggests that by the third millennium BCE and into the second, several language groups already existed in the region. These included:[17][18]\\r\\nLinks between Hurro-Urartian and Hattic and the indigenous languages of the Caucasus have frequently been suggested, but are not generally accepted.\\r\\nCoordinates: 36N 40E? / ?36N 40E? / 36; 40","input":"What is the fertile crescent also known as?"},{"output":"in 1608","context":"Capital punishment is a legal penalty in the United States, currently used by 31 states, the federal government, and the military.[1] Its existence can be traced to the beginning of the American colonies. The United States is the only Western country currently applying the death penalty,[2] one of 54 countries worldwide applying it, and was the first to develop lethal injection as a method of execution, which has since been adopted by five other countries.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no executions in the United States between 1967 and 1977. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment statutes in Furman v. Georgia, reducing all death sentences pending at the time to life imprisonment.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequently, a majority of states passed new death penalty statutes, and the court affirmed the legality of capital punishment in the 1976 case Gregg v. Georgia. Since then, more than 7,800 defendants have been sentenced to death;[5] of these, more than 1,400 have been executed,[6] 161 who were sentenced to death in the modern era were exonerated before their execution,[7][8] and more than 2,900 are still on death row.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded death sentence in the British North American colonies was carried out in 1608 on Captain George Kendall,[10] who was executed by firing squad[11] at the Jamestown colony for spying for the Spanish government.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bill of Rights adopted in 1789 included the Eighth Amendment which prohibited cruel and unusual punishment. The Fifth Amendment was drafted with language implying a possible use of the death penalty, requiring a grand jury indictment for \\"capital crime\\" and a due process of law for deprivation of \\"life\\" by the government.[13] The Fourteenth Amendment adopted in 1868 also requires a due process of law for deprivation of life by any states.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Espy file,[14] compiled by M. Watt Espy and John Ortiz Smykla, lists 15,269 people executed in the United States and its predecessor colonies between 1608 and 1991. From 1930 to 2002, there were 4,661 executions in the U.S., about two-thirds of them in the first 20 years.[15] Additionally, the United States Army executed 135 soldiers between 1916 and 1955 (the most recent).[16][17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree states abolished the death penalty for murder during the 19th century: Michigan (which has never executed a prisoner since achieving statehood) in 1846, Wisconsin in 1853 and Maine in 1887. Rhode Island is also a state with a long abolitionist background, having repealed the death penalty in 1852, though it was theoretically available for murder committed by a prisoner between 1872 and 1984.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther states which abolished the death penalty for murder before Gregg v. Georgia include: Minnesota in 1911, Vermont in 1964, Iowa and West Virginia in 1965 and North Dakota in 1973. Hawaii abolished the death penalty in 1948 and Alaska in 1957, both before their statehood. Puerto Rico repealed it in 1929 and the District of Columbia in 1981. Arizona and Oregon abolished the death penalty by popular vote in 1916 and 1964 respectively, but both reinstated it, again by popular vote, some years later: Arizona in 1918 and Oregon in 1978.[19] Puerto Rico and Michigan are the only two U.S. jurisdictions to have explicitly prohibited capital punishment in their constitutions: in 1952 and 1964, respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, capital punishment continued to be used by a majority of states and the federal government for various crimes, especially murder and rape, from the creation of the United States up to the beginning of the 1960s. Until then, \\"save for a few mavericks, no one gave any credence to the possibility of ending the death penalty by judicial interpretation of constitutional law\\", according to abolitionist Hugo Bedau.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe possibility of challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty became progressively more realistic after the Supreme Court of the United States decided Trop v. Dulles in 1958, when the court said explicitly for the first time that the Eighth Amendment's cruel and unusual clause must draw its meaning from the \\"evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society\\", rather than from its original meaning. Also in the 1932 case Powell v. Alabama, the court made the first step of what would later be called \\"death is different\\" jurisprudence, when it held that any indigent defendant was entitled to a court-appointed attorney in capital cases - a right that was only later extended to non-capital defendants in 1963, with Gideon v. Wainwright.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Furman v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court considered a group of consolidated cases. The lead case involved an individual convicted under Georgia's death penalty statute, which featured a \\"unitary trial\\" procedure in which the jury was asked to return a verdict of guilt or innocence and, simultaneously, determine whether the defendant would be punished by death or life imprisonment. The last pre-Furman execution was that of Luis Monge on June 2, 1967.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the impositions of the death penalty in each of the consolidated cases as unconstitutional in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court has never ruled the death penalty to be per se unconstitutional. The five justices in the majority did not produce a common opinion or rationale for their decision, however, and agreed only on a short statement announcing the result. The narrowest opinions, those of Byron White and Potter Stewart, expressed generalized concerns about the inconsistent application of the death penalty across a variety of cases, but did not exclude the possibility of a constitutional death penalty law. Stewart and William O. Douglas worried explicitly about racial discrimination in enforcement of the death penalty. Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan Jr. expressed the opinion that the death penalty was proscribed absolutely by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Furman decision caused all death sentences pending at the time to be reduced to life imprisonment, and was described by scholars as a \\"legal bombshell\\".[4] The next day, columnist Barry Schweid wrote that it was \\"unlikely\\" that the death penalty could exist anymore in the United States.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of abandoning capital punishment, 37 states enacted new death penalty statutes that attempted to address the concerns of White and Stewart in Furman. Some states responded by enacting mandatory death penalty statutes which prescribed a sentence of death for anyone convicted of certain forms of murder. White had hinted that such a scheme would meet his constitutional concerns in his Furman opinion. Other states adopted \\"bifurcated\\" trial and sentencing procedures, with various procedural limitations on the jury's ability to pronounce a death sentence designed to limit juror discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 2, 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Gregg v. Georgia[22] and upheld 7-2 a Georgia procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty - either death or life in prison, either with or without parole. The same day, in Woodson v. North Carolina[23] and Roberts v. Louisiana,[24] the court struck down 5-4 statutes providing a mandatory death sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutions resumed on January 17, 1977, when Gary Gilmore went before a firing squad in Utah. Although hundreds of individuals were sentenced to death in the United States during the 1970s and early 1980s, only ten people besides Gilmore (who had waived all of his appeal rights) were actually executed prior to 1984.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, the Supreme Court's Coker v. Georgia decision barred the death penalty for rape of an adult woman. Previously, the death penalty for rape of an adult had been gradually phased out in the United States, and at the time of the decision, Georgia and the U.S. Federal government were the only two jurisdictions to still retain the death penalty for that offense.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1980 case Godfrey v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that murder can be punished by death only if it involves a narrow and precise aggravating factor.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has placed two major restrictions on the use of the death penalty. First, the case of Atkins v. Virginia, decided on June 20, 2002,[26] held that the execution of intellectually disabled inmates is unconstitutional. Second, in 2005, the court's decision in Roper v. Simmons[27] struck down executions for offenders under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2008 case Kennedy v. Louisiana, the court also held 5-4 that the death penalty is unconstitutional when applied to non-homicidal crimes against the person, including child rape. Only two death row inmates (both in Louisiana) were affected by the decision.[28] Nevertheless, the ruling came less than five months before the 2008 presidential election and was criticized by both major party candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, New York and Kansas capital sentencing schemes were struck down by their respective state highest courts. Kansas successfully appealed the Kansas Supreme Court decision to the United States Supreme Court, who reinstated the statute in Kansas v. Marsh (2006), holding it did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The decision of New York Court of Appeals was based on the state constitution, making unavailable any appeal. The state lower house has since blocked all attempts to reinstate the death penalty by adopting a valid sentencing scheme.[30] In 2016, Delaware's death penalty statute was also struck down by its state supreme court.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, New Jersey became the first state to repeal the death penalty by legislative vote since Gregg v. Georgia,[32] followed by New Mexico in 2009,[33][34] Illinois in 2011,[35] Connecticut in 2012,[36][37] and Maryland in 2013.[38] The repeals were not retroactive, but in New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland, governors commuted all death sentences after enacting the new law.[39] In Connecticut, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the repeal must be retroactive. New Mexico is the only state with remaining death row inmates and no present death penalty statute.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nNebraska's legislature also passed a repeal in 2015, but a referendum campaign gathered enough signatures to suspend it. Capital punishment was reinstated by popular vote on November 8, 2016. The same day, California's electorate defeated a proposal to repeal the death penalty, and adopted another initiative to speed up its appeal process.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Furman, 11 states have organized popular votes dealing with the death penalty through the initiative and referendum process. All resulted in a vote for reinstating it, rejecting its abolition, expanding its application field, specifying in the state constitution that it is not unconstitutional, or expediting the appeal process in capital cases.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\n19 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have abolished the death penalty for all crimes. Below is a table of the 19 states and the date that the state abolished the death penalty.[42][43][44][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1976 to July 1, 2018, there were 1,477 executions, of which 1,302 were by lethal injection, 158 by electrocution, 11 by gas inhalation, 3 by hanging, and 3 by firing squad.[47] The South had the great majority of these executions, with 1,207; there were 181 in the Midwest, 85 in the West, and only 4 in the Northeast. No state in the Northeast has conducted an execution since Connecticut, now abolitionist, in 2005. The state of Texas alone conducted 552 executions, over 1/3 of the total; the states of Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma combined make up over half the total, with 777 executions between them.[48] 3 executions have been conducted by the federal government, the last in 2003. Executions increased in frequency until 1999; 98 prisoners were executed that year. Since 1999, the number of executions has greatly decreased, and the 20 executions in 2016 were the fewest since 1991.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe death penalty was a notable issue during the 1988 presidential election. It came up in the October 13, 1988, debate between the two presidential nominees George H. W. Bush and Michael Dukakis, when Bernard Shaw, the moderator of the debate, asked Dukakis, \\"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\\" Dukakis replied, \\"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\\" Bush was elected, and many, including Dukakis himself, cite the statement as the beginning of the end of his campaign.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, Congress passed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to streamline the appeal process in capital cases. The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, who had endorsed capital punishment during his 1992 presidential campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study found that at least 34 of the 749 executions carried out in the U.S. between 1977 and 2001, or 4.5%, involved \\"unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner\\". The rate of these \\"botched executions\\" remained steady over the period.[50] A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics in the prisoner was insufficient to ensure unconsciousness.[51] Nonetheless, the Supreme Court ruled in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and again in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1632, 24 years after the first recorded male execution in the colonies, Jane Champion became the first woman to be lawfully executed.[53] She was sentenced to death by hanging after she was convicted of murder in front of a grand jury.[54] The second half of the 17th century saw the executions of 14 women and 6 men who were accused of witchcraft during the witch hunt hysteria and the Salem Witch Trials.  While both men and women were  executed, 80% of the accusations were towards women, so the list of executions disproportionately affected men by a margin of 6 (actual) to 4 (expected), i.e. 50% more men were executed than expected from the percentage of accused who were men.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable female executions include Mary Surratt, Margie Velma Barfield and Wanda Jean Allen.  Mary Surratt was executed by hanging in 1865 after being convicted of co-conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.[56] Margie Velma Barfield was convicted of murder and when she was executed by lethal injection in 1984, she became the first woman to be executed since the ban on capital punishment was lifted in 1976.[57] Wanda Jean Allen was convicted of murder in 1989 and had a high-profile execution by lethal injection in January 2001.  She was the first black woman to be executed in the US since 1954.[58]  According to Allen's lawyers, prosecutors capitalized on her low IQ, race and homosexuality in their representations of her as a murderer at trial.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nAggravating factors for seeking capital punishment of murder vary greatly among death penalty states. California has twenty-two;[60] New Hampshire has seven.[61]\\r\\nSome aggravating circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving rape of the victim, and murder of an on-duty police officer.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral states have included child murder to their list of aggravating factors, but the victim's age under which the murder is punishable by death varies. In 2011, Texas raised this age from six to ten.[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some states, the high number of aggravating factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony).[64] Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order for a person to be eligible for a death sentence when convicted of aggravated first-degree murder, the jury or court (when there is not a jury) must determine at least one of sixteen aggravating factors that existed during the crime's commission. The following is a list of the 16 aggravating factors.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opinion of the court in Kennedy v. Louisiana says that the ruling does not apply to \\"treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State\\".[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince no one is on death row for such offenses, the court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of the death penalty applied for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTreason, espionage and large-scale drug trafficking are all capital crimes under federal law. Treason is also punishable by death in six states (Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Missouri). Vermont still has a pre-Furman statute providing the death penalty for treason despite removing capital punishment for murder in 1965.[72] Large-scale drug trafficking is punishable by death in two states (Florida and Missouri).[73] Aircraft hijacking is a capital crime in Georgia and Mississippi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe legal administration of the death penalty in the United States typically involves five critical steps: (1) prosecutorial decision to seek the death penalty (2) sentencing, (3) direct review, (4) state collateral review, and (5) federal habeas corpus.\\r\\n\\r\\nClemency, through which the Governor or President of the jurisdiction can unilaterally reduce or abrogate a death sentence, is an executive rather than judicial process.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile judges in criminal cases can usually impose a harsher prison sentence than the one demanded by prosecution, the death penalty can be handed down only if the accuser has specifically decided to seek it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the decades since Furman, new questions have emerged about whether or not prosecutorial arbitrariness has replaced sentencing arbitrariness. A study by Pepperdine University School of Law published in Temple Law Review, surveyed the decision-making process among prosecutors in various states. The authors found that prosecutors' capital punishment filing decisions remain marked by local \\"idiosyncrasies\\", suggesting they are not in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court's directive. This means that \\"the very types of unfairness that the Supreme Court sought to eliminate\\" may still \\"infect capital cases\\". Wide prosecutorial discretion remains because of overly broad criteria. California law, for example, has 22 \\"special circumstances\\", making nearly all premeditated murders potential capital cases.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nA proposed remedy against prosecutorial arbitrariness is to transfer the prosecution of capital cases to the state attorney general.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the 31 states with the death penalty, 28 provide the sentence to be decided by a jury, and 28 require a unanimous sentence. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only state which does not require a unanimous jury decision is Alabama. In Alabama, at least 10 jurors must concur. A retrial happens if the jury deadlocks.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nNebraska is the only state in which the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel. If one of the judges on the panel opposes death, the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nMontana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all states in which the jury is involved, only death-qualified veniremen can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury:[80][81]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first outcome is referred as the \\"true unanimity\\" rule, while the third has been criticized as the \\"single-juror veto\\" rule.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a defendant is sentenced to death at the trial level, the case then goes into a direct review.[84] The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not.[85] Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand.[84] If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing.[86] Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.[86] About 60 percent survive the process of direct review intact.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt times when a death sentence is affirmed on direct review, supplemental methods to attack the judgment, though less familiar than a typical appeal, do remain. These supplemental remedies are considered collateral review, that is, an avenue for upsetting judgments that have become otherwise final.[88] Where the prisoner received his death sentence in a state-level trial, as is usually the case, the first step in collateral review is state collateral review, which is often called state habeas corpus. (If the case is a federal death penalty case, it proceeds immediately from direct review to federal habeas corpus.) Although all states have some type of collateral review, the process varies widely from state to state.[89] Generally, the purpose of these collateral proceedings is to permit the prisoner to challenge his sentence on grounds that could not have been raised reasonably at trial or on direct review.[90] Most often, these are claims, such as ineffective assistance of counsel, which requires the court to consider new evidence outside the original trial record, something courts may not do in an ordinary appeal. State collateral review, though an important step in that it helps define the scope of subsequent review through federal habeas corpus, is rarely successful in and of itself. Only around 6 percent of death sentences are overturned on state collateral review.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Virginia, state habeas corpus for condemned men are heard by the state supreme court under exclusive original jurisdiction since 1995, immediately after direct review by the same court.[92] This avoids any proceeding before the lower courts, and is in part why Virginia has the shortest time on average between death sentence and execution (less than eight years) and has executed 113 offenders since 1976 with only five remaining on death row as of June 2017.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo reduce litigation delays, other states require convicts to file their state collateral appeal before the completion of their direct appeal,[95] or provide adjudication of direct and collateral attacks together in a \\"unitary review\\".[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a death sentence is affirmed in state collateral review, the prisoner may file for federal habeas corpus, which is a unique type of lawsuit that can be brought in federal courts. Federal habeas corpus is a type of collateral review, and it is the only way that state prisoners may attack a death sentence in federal court (other than petitions for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after both direct review and state collateral review). The scope of federal habeas corpus is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), which restricted significantly its previous scope. The purpose of federal habeas corpus is to ensure that state courts, through the process of direct review and state collateral review, have done a reasonable job in protecting the prisoner's federal constitutional rights. Prisoners may also use federal habeas corpus suits to bring forth new evidence that they are innocent of the crime, though to be a valid defense at this late stage in the process, evidence of innocence must be truly compelling.[97] According to Eric Freedman, 21 percent of death penalty cases are reversed through federal habeas corpus.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Liebman, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, stated in 1996 that his study found that when habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases were traced from conviction to completion of the case, there was \\"a 40 percent success rate in all capital cases from 1978 to 1995\\".[98] Similarly, a study by Ronald Tabak in a law review article puts the success rate in habeas corpus cases involving death row inmates even higher, finding that between \\"1976 and 1991, approximately 47 percent of the habeas petitions filed by death row inmates were granted\\".[99] The different numbers are largely definitional, rather than substantive: Freedam's statistics looks at the percentage of all death penalty cases reversed, while the others look only at cases not reversed prior to habeas corpus review.\\r\\n\\r\\nA similar process is available for prisoners sentenced to death by the judgment of a federal court.[100]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe AEDPA also provides an expeditious habeas procedure in capital cases for states meeting several requirements set forth in it concerning counsel appointment for death row inmates.[101] Under this program, federal habeas corpus for condemned prisoners would be decided in about three years from affirmance of the sentence on state collateral review. In 2006, Congress conferred the determination of whether a state fulfilled the requirements to the U.S. attorney general, with a possible appeal of the state to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As of March 2016, the Department of Justice has still not granted any certifications.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the federal court refuses to issue a writ of habeas corpus, the death sentence becomes final for all purposes. In recent times, however, prisoners have postponed execution through another way of federal litigation using the Civil Rights Act of 1871 - codified at 42 U.S.C.??1983 - which allows people to bring lawsuits against state actors to protect their federal constitutional and statutory rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the aforementioned appeals are normally limited to one and automatically stay the execution of the death sentence, Section 1983 lawsuits are unlimited, but the petitioner will be granted a stay of execution only if the court believes he has a likelihood of success on the merits.[103]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death.[104] In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the execution warrant is issued by the governor in several states, in the vast majority it is a judicial order, issued by a judge or by the state supreme court at the request of the prosecution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe warrant usually sets an execution day. Some states instead provide a longer period, such as a week or 10 days to carry out the execution. This is designated to avoid issuing a new warrant in case of a last-minute stay of execution that would be vacated only few days or few hours later.[105]\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the context of the overall murder rate, the death penalty cannot be said to be widely or routinely used in the United States; in recent years the average has been about one death sentence for every 200 murder convictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlabama has the highest per capita rate of death sentences. This is because Alabama was one of the few states that allowed judges to override a jury recommendation in favor of life imprisonment, a possibility it removed in March 2017.[106][107]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe distribution of death sentences among states is loosely proportional to their populations and murder rates. California, which is the most populous state, has also the largest death row with over 700 inmates. Wyoming, which is the least populous state, has only one condemned man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut executions are more frequent (and happen more quickly after sentencing) in conservative states. Texas, which is the second most populous state of the Union, carried out over 500 executions during the post-Furman era, more than a third of the national total. California has carried out only 13 executions during the same period, and has carried out none since 2006.[108][109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican Americans made up 41% of death row inmates while making up only 12.6% of the general population. They have made up 34% of those actually executed since 1976. However, this is an under-representation relative to the proportion of convicted murderers; 52.5% of all homicide offenders between 1980 and 2008 were African Americans.[111] According to a 2003 Amnesty International report, blacks and whites were the victims of murder in almost equal numbers, yet 80% of the people executed since 1977 were convicted of murders involving white victims.[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 13.5% of death row inmates are of Hispanic or Latino descent, while they make up 17.4% of the general population.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of October 1, 2016, the Death Penalty Information Center reports that there are only 54 women on death row.  This constitutes 1.86% of the total death row population.  16 women have been executed since 1976,[114] while 1442 men have been executed.[115]  15,391 total confirmed lawful executions have been carried out in the US since 1608, and of these, 575, or 3.6%, were women.  Women account for 1/50 death sentences, 1/67 people on death row, and 1/100 people whose executions are actually carried out.  The states that have executed the most women are California, Texas and Florida. For women, the racial breakdown of those sentenced to death is 21% black, 13% Latina, 2% American Indian, 61% white and 3% Asian.[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll 31 states with the death penalty provide lethal injection as the primary method of execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states allow other methods than lethal injection, but only as secondary methods to be used merely at the request of the prisoner or if lethal injection is unavailable.[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral states continue to use the historical three-drug protocol: an anesthetic, pancuronium bromide a paralytic, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.[118] Eight states have used a single-drug protocol, inflicting only an overdose of a single anesthetic to the prisoner.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some state statutes specify the drugs required, a majority do not, giving more flexibility to corrections officials.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nPressures from anti-death penalty activists and shareholders have made it difficult for correctional services to get the chemicals. Hospira, the only U.S. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, stopped making the drug in 2011.[119] In 2016, it was reported that more than 20 U.S. and European drug manufacturers including Pfizer (the owner of Hospira) had taken steps to prevent their drugs from being used for lethal injections.[119][120][121]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince then, some states have used other anesthetics, such as pentobarbital, etomidate,[122] or fast-acting benzodiazepines like midazolam.[123] Many states have since bought lethal injection drugs from foreign furnishers, and most states have made it a criminal offense to reveal the identities of furnishers or execution team members.[119][124] In November 2015, California adopted regulations allowing the state to use its own public compounding pharmacies to make the chemicals.[125]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Ohio approved the use of an intramuscular injection of 500?mg of hydromorphone (a 333-fold overdose for an opioid-na?ve patient of this narcotic analgesic closely related to and five times stronger than morphine; this is the equivalent of an entire 50-ml bottle of Dilaudid HP, the most powerful commercially available form, although the advantage of hydromorphone is its very high solubility allowing for solutions of almost arbitrary concentration; 500?mg of hydromorphone HCl as pure powder can be dissolved in isotonic saline in volumes as small as under 2 cc)[126] and a supratherapeutic dose of midazolam as a backup means of carrying out executions when a suitable vein cannot be found for intravenous injection.[127][128]\\r\\n\\r\\nLethal injection was held to be a constitutional method of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases: Baze v. Rees (2008) and Glossip v. Gross (2015).[129][130]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the following states, death row inmates with an execution warrant may choose to be executed by:[116][117]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn five states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Utah), the alternative method is offered only to inmates sentenced to death for crimes committed prior to a specified date (usually when the state switched from the earlier method to lethal injection).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an offender chooses to be executed by a means different from the state default method, which is always lethal injection, he/she loses the right to challenge its constitutionality in court. See Stewart v. LaGrand, 526 US 115 (1999).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last executions by methods other than injection are as follows (all chosen by the inmate):\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on the state, the following alternative methods are statutorily provided in the event that lethal injection is either found unconstitutional by a court or unavailable for practical reasons:[116][117][131]\\r\\n\\r\\nOklahoma is the only state allowing more than two methods of execution in its statutes, providing lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, electrocution and firing squad to be used in that order in the event that all earlier methods are unavailable. The nitrogen option was added by the Oklahoma Legislature in 2015 and has never been used in a judicial execution, though it is routinely used to give a painless death in animal euthanasia.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nThree states (Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah) have added back-up methods recently in 2014 or 2015 (or have expanded their application fields) in reaction to the shortage of lethal injection drugs.[133]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome states such as Florida have a larger provision dealing with execution methods unavailability, requiring their state departments of corrections to use \\"any constitutional method\\" if both lethal injection and electrocution are found unconstitutional. This was designed to make unnecessary any further legislative intervention in that event, but the provision applies only to legal (not practical) infeasibility.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2016, an Oklahoma grand jury recommended the state to use nitrogen hypoxia as its primary method of execution rather than as a mere backup, after experts testified that the method would be painless, easy and \\"inexpensive\\".[136]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method of execution of federal prisoners for offenses under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is that of the state in which the conviction took place. If the state has no death penalty, the judge must choose a state with the death penalty for carrying out the execution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe federal government has a facility (at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute) and regulations only for executions by lethal injection, but the United States Code allows U.S. Marshals to use state facilities and employees for federal executions.[137][138]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last public execution in the U.S. was that of Rainey Bethea in Owensboro, Kentucky, on August 14, 1936.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the last execution in the nation at which the general public was permitted to attend without any legally imposed restrictions. \\"Public execution\\" is a legal phrase, defined by the laws of various states, and carried out pursuant to a court order. Similar to \\"public record\\" or \\"public meeting\\", it means that anyone who wants to attend the execution may do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\", or to \\"exclude public view\\". Most states laws currently use such explicit wording to prohibit public executions, while others do so only implicitly by enumerating the only authorized witnesses.[139]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll states allow news reporters to be execution witnesses for information of the general public, except Wyoming which allow only witnesses authorized by the condemned.[140][141][142]\\r\\nSeveral states also allow victims' families and relatives selected by the prisoner to watch executions. An hour or two before the execution, the condemned is offered religious services and to choose his last meal (except in Texas which abolished it in 2011).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe execution of Timothy McVeigh on June 11, 2001, was witnessed by over 200 people, most by closed-circuit television.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallup, Inc. monitors support for the death penalty in the United States since 1937 by asking \\"Are you in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder?\\" Gallup surveys document a sharp increase in support for capital punishment between 1966 and 1994 clearly in response to rising violent crime rates during this period (e.g. Page and Shapiro 1992.) However, with the dramatic surge in arguments questioning the fairness of the sentence (due, in part, to DNA exonerations of death row inmates in the national media in the late 1990s (Baumgartner, De Boef, and Boydstun 2004 The Decline of the Death Penalty and the Discovery of Innocence ),[143] support then began to wane, falling from 80% in 1994 to 66% in 2000. Moreover, approval varies substantially depending on the characteristics of the target and the alternatives posed, with much lower support for putting juveniles and the mentally ill to death (26% and 19%, respectively, in 2002) and for the alternative of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole (52% in 2003) Gallup 2005). Given the fact that attitudes toward this policy are often responsive to events, to characteristics of the target, and to alternatives, the conventional wisdomthat death penalty attitudes are impervious to changeis surely overstated. Accordingly, any analysis of death penalty attitudes must account for the responsiveness of such attitudes, as well as their reputed resistance to change[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the October 2016 Gallup poll, 60% of respondents said they were in favor and 37% were opposed.[145]\\r\\n\\r\\nPew Research polls have demonstrated declining American support for the death penalty: 80% in 1974, 78% in 1996, 55% in 2014, and 49% in 2016.[146][147] The 2014 poll showed significant differences by race: 63% of whites, 40% of Hispanics, and 36% of blacks, respectively, supported the death penalty in that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever in 2018 Polls showed Public support for the death penalty increased up to 54% up from 49%. Since 2016, opinions among Republicans and Democrats have changed little, but the share of independents favoring the death penalty has increased 8 percentage points (from 44% to 52%).[148]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2010 poll found that 61% of voters would choose a penalty other than the death sentence for murder.[149] When persons surveyed are given a choice between the death penalty and life without parole for persons convicted of capital crimes, support for execution has traditionally been significantly lower than in polling that asks only if a person does or does not support the death penalty. In 2010, for instance, a Gallup poll that offered a choice showed 49% favoring the death penalty, and 46% favoring life imprisonment.[150]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, in November 2009, another Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans say that September 11 attacks' mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should get the death penalty if convicted, including 12 who normally opposed the death penalty when asked the 1937 question.[151] A similar result was found in 2001 when respondents were polled about the execution of Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 victims.[152]\\r\\n\\r\\nCapital punishment is a controversial issue, with many prominent organizations and individuals participating in the debate. Amnesty International and other groups oppose capital punishment on moral grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome law enforcement organizations, and some victims' rights groups support capital punishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States is one of the four developed countries that still practice capital punishment, along with Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligious groups are widely split on the issue of capital punishment.[153] The Fiqh Council of North America, a group of highly influential Muslim scholars in the United States, has issued a fatwa calling for a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States until various preconditions in the legal system are met.[154]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2009, the American Law Institute voted to disavow the framework for capital punishment that it had created in 1962, as part of the Model Penal Code, \\"in light of the current intractable institutional and structural obstacles to ensuring a minimally adequate system for administering capital punishment\\". A study commissioned by the institute had said that experience had proved that the goal of individualized decisions about who should be executed and the goal of systemic fairness for minorities and others could not be reconciled.[155] As of  2017[update], 159 prisoners have been exonerated due to evidence of their innocence.[149][156][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAdvocates of the death penalty say that it deters crime, is a good tool for prosecutors in plea bargaining,[157] improves the community by eliminating recidivism by executed criminals, provides \\"closure\\" to surviving victims or loved ones, and is a just penalty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe murder rate is highest in the South (6.5 per 100,000 in 2016), where 80% of executions are carried out, and lowest in the Northeast (3.5 per 100,000), with less than 1% of executions. A report by the US National Research Council in 2012 stated that studies claiming a deterrent effect are \\"fundamentally flawed\\" and should not be used for policy decisions.[149]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a survey of the former and present presidents of the country's top academic criminological societies, 88% of these experts rejected the notion that the death penalty acts as a deterrent to murder.\\r\\nData shows that the application of the death penalty is strongly influenced by racial bias.[149] Furthermore, some opponents argue that it is applied in an arbitrary manner by a criminal justice system that has been shown to be biased through the systemic influence of socio-economic, geographic, and gender factors.[158] Another argument in the capital punishment debate is the cost.[159][149]\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious commentators predicted that the death penalty would likely have disappeared in the United States if Hillary Clinton had been elected U.S. President in November 2016 and allowed to appoint a liberal Supreme Court Justice to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Because Donald Trump won and citizens in three states voted the same day for ballot measures supporting capital punishment, columnists came to the conclusion that it will remain indefinitely.[160][161][162]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the main arguments against the use of capital punishment in the United States is that there has been a long history of botched executions. University of Colorado Boulder Professor Michael L. Radelet described a \\"botched execution\\" as an execution that causes the prisoner to suffer for a long period of time before they die.[163] This has led to citizens having the opinion that capital punishment is cruel and unusual punishment. The following is a short list of examples of botched executions that have occurred in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest number of clemencies was granted in January 2003 in Illinois when outgoing Governor George Ryan, who had already imposed a moratorium on executions, pardoned four death-row inmates and commuted the sentences of the remaining 167 to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[172] When Governor Pat Quinn signed legislation abolishing the death penalty in Illinois in March 2011, he commuted the sentences of the fifteen inmates on death row to life imprisonment.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious post-Furman mass clemencies took place in 1986 in New Mexico, when Governor Toney Anaya commuted all death sentences because of his personal opposition to the death penalty. In 1991, outgoing Ohio Governor Dick Celeste commuted the sentences of eight prisoners, among them all four women on the state's death row. And during his two terms (1979-1987) as Florida's Governor, Bob Graham, although a strong death penalty supporter who had overseen the first post-Furman involuntary execution as well as 15 others, agreed to commute the sentences of six people on the grounds of doubts about guilt or disproportionality.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll executions were suspended through the country between September 2007 and April 2008. At that time, the U.S. Supreme Court was examining the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees. This was the longest period with no executions in the United States since 1982. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld this method in a 7ÿ2 ruling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the states that have no valid death penalty statute, the following states and jurisdictions are noted that have an official moratorium, or have had no executions for more than ten years, as of 2018:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the above, Kansas (last execution 1965) and New Hampshire (last execution 1939) have also had no executions for over ten years, but in these states it is because of the lack of death row inmates having exhausted the appeal process.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1976, four states have executed only condemned prisoners who voluntarily waived further appeals: Pennsylvania has executed three inmates, Oregon two, Connecticut one, and New Mexico one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn North Carolina, executions are suspended following a decision by the state's medical board that physicians cannot participate in executions, which is a requirement under state law.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn California, United States District Judge Jeremy Fogel suspended all executions in the state on December 15, 2006, ruling that the implementation used in California was unconstitutional but that it could be fixed.[177]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 25, 2009, the Kentucky Supreme Court suspended executions until the state adopts regulations for carrying out the penalty by lethal injection.[178]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2011, Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber announced a moratorium on executions in Oregon, canceling a planned execution and ordering a review of the death penalty system in the state.[179]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 11, 2014, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a capital punishment moratorium. All death penalty cases that come to Inslee will result in him issuing a reprieve, not a pardon or commutation.[180]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 13, 2015, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced a moratorium on the death penalty. Wolf will issue a reprieve for every execution until a commission on capital punishment, which was established in 2011 by the Pennsylvania State Senate, produces a recommendation.[181] Effectively there was a moratorium in place, as the state had not executed anyone since Gary M.

The older version, ossobuco in bianco, is flavoured with cinnamon, bay leaf and gremolata. The modern and more popular recipe includes tomatoes, carrots, celery and onions; gremolata is optional.

Taking place a month after the first season finale, Dexter has been unable to kill anyone due to Sgt. James Doakes monitoring his activities and his sister Debra now living with him as she recovers from her traumatic experiences concerning Brian, the Ice Truck Killer. Dexter also realizes that he's having trouble killing even when he has the opportunity, due to feelings of guilt over killing his brother Brian.\\r\\nRita doubts Dexter's reliability and honesty after finding evidence that he set up her husband Paul to be returned to prison. After her husband dies in a prison fight, Rita confronts Dexter with her suspicions. He admits to setting up Paul but can't fully explain how he knew to stage convincing evidence that the man was using heroin. Rita incorrectly concludes that Dexter is, like Paul, a drug addict and that this explains his occasional absences and odd behavior. Dexter decides to falsely admit that this is the case and promises to seek help by joining Narcotics Anonymous. There, he meets Lila Tournay, who offers to be his sponsor. Sgt. James Doakes remains suspicious of Dexter's true motives, and constantly monitors Dexter's whereabouts.\\r\\nDivers accidentally stumble upon Dexter's underwater burial ground, discovering the many bags containing the body parts of his victims. Realizing this dumping ground is the work of a serial killer, the media dubs these bodies the work of the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher.\\" When it's revealed that each victim was a criminal and killer, some members of the public openly support the Bay Harbor Butcher; the case even inspires the creation of a knife-wielding comic book superhero \\"The Dark Defender.\\" To oversee the investigation of the Butcher's crimes, an FBI special team is assigned to Miami, led by FBI Special Agent Lundy. Working with Miami Metro PD, Lundy brings in several of the Miami detectives, including Debra, to join his team. Over time, Debra and Lundy become romantically involved.\\r\\nTo ensure he's not identified as the Bay Harbor Butcher, Dexter finds a new dumping ground that leads to the Atlantic Ocean. He also falsifies records, destroys evidence, and contaminates refrigerated remains to throw the investigators off his trail. Despite this, Lundy narrows down his suspect search to people in Miami with police training. Dexter puts his guilt over Brian behind him and returns to killing. Dexter later learns that his biological mother died because she was a criminal working as a confidential informant for Harry and had an affair with him. Dexter wonders if he was adopted because Harry felt guilty for his mother's death and he also learns that Harry didn't die of natural causes but purposefully overdosed to cause his own death. He doesn't understand why until later in the season.\\r\\nDoakes becomes confident of Dexter's guilt and confronts him. Dexter then tricks Doakes into assaulting him in public, leading others to side with Dexter that the Sergeant is out of control and unjustly targeting him. Becoming more desperate, Doakes breaks into Dexter's apartment and finds the box of blood samples collected from his victims. However, the investigative team mistakenly concluded that Doakes is the Butcher after finding the box in his car, and Doakes goes into hiding while still tracking Dexter's movements. Lieutenant LaGuerta attempts to vouch for the innocence of her former partner, but Lundy refuses to consider her evidence after he learns that she didn't share certain information with him because of her emotional involvement with Doakes.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Dexter's relationship with Lila becomes more romantic as she shows him how to accept who he is; this further hurts Dexter's relationship with Rita. Dexter learns that Lila is a pyromaniac, at one point purposely setting fire to her apartment and feigning innocence to draw Dexter back to her. When she starts to follow him obsessively, he takes measures to distance himself from her, eventually foregoing their relationship. Realizing he is developing genuine connection to Rita and her children Astor and Cody, Dexter returns to them. Lila is furious and begins to track Dexter's movements, while also dating Detective Angel Batista. Dexter warns Batista that Lila is not to be trusted but he dismisses the concern. Later, Lila brings rape charges against Batista and tells Dexter she'll drop them if he returns to her. Debra investigates Lila and finds that she is in the country illegally, threatening her with deportation if she doesn't leave Miami.\\r\\nDexter tracks down the men responsible for his mother's death. One is dead, one is in jail and one, a drug dealer named Jimenez, is alive. Dexter targets Jimenez and tracks down the dealer's secluded cabin in the nearby swamps, where Dexter kills him. Dexter is called away before he can dispose of the body, but feels confident that the cabin is remote. When he finally goes back, he is unaware that Doakes is following him. Dexter subdues Doakes and locks him in a makeshift cell within the cabin, admitting to the sergeant that he is indeed the Bay Harbor Butcher. Dexter decides that he'll escape the law by convincing others that Doakes is the butcher. He kills a drug lord in the cabin in front of Doakes, shocking the police sergeant. Seeing Doakes' reaction to his actions reminds Dexter of something Harry said days before he died. Dexter suddenly realizes that his father committed suicide because he was ashamed of training Dexter to be a serial killer. Horrified, Dexter tells Doakes, \\"I killed my father.\\"\\r\\nWhile Dexter considers that he must be held responsible for his crimes, Lila takes the GPS device from Dexter's car and uses it to locate the cabin. She finds Doakes, who explains that he is a prisoner of Dexter Morgan, the Bay Harbor Butcher, and needs help. Deciding she now understands Dexter and must help him, Lila leaves Doakes imprisoned and then lights the cabin's gas stove and opens a propane tank. She leaves and Doakes fails to escape, dying in the explosion. Finding Doakes' body and the other evidence Dexter left behind, the FBI concludes that Sgt. Doakes was indeed the Bay Harbor Butcher.\\r\\nLila admits her actions to Dexter and reaches out to him. Although he is glad not to be going to jail, Dexter did not intend to kill Doakes since he didn't fit the requirements of \\"Harry's Code.\\" However, since Lila is a murderer, he plans to kill her since she is too dangerous to his personal life. He pretends that he wants to run away with Lila, but she realizes the truth and kidnaps Rita's children Astor and Cody. At the same time, Debra is on her way to leaving Miami with Lundy rather than letting their relationship end, but then misses the flight when she learns that the children are in danger and Dexter needs her. Lila lures Dexter to her apartment and then sets it on fire with him and the kids still inside. She leaves, sure that they will all die, but Dexter and the children escape.

The track was produced by George Martin for McCartney's album, Pipes of Peace. The song was recorded during production of McCartney's 1982 Tug of War album, about a year before the release of \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the pair's first duet from Jackson's album Thriller (1982).\\r\\nAfter its release in October 1983, \\"Say Say Say\\" became Jackson's seventh top-ten hit inside a year. It was a number one hit in the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, and several other countries, reached number two in the United Kingdom, and peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and over 20 other nations. In 2013, Billboard magazine listed the song as the 41st biggest hit of all-time on the Billboard Hot 100 charts.[1]\\r\\nThe single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in December 1983, representing sales of one million copies. The single was promoted with a music video directed by Bob Giraldi. The video, filmed in Santa Ynez Valley, California, features cameo appearances by Linda McCartney, La Toya Jackson and Giraldi. The short film centers around two con artists called \\"Mac and Jack\\" (played by McCartney and Jackson), and is credited for the introduction of dialogue and storyline to music videos.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMcCartney biographer Ray Coleman asserted that the majority of the song's lyrics were written by Jackson, and given to McCartney the next day.[2] Recording began at AIR Studios in London in May 1981. At the time, McCartney was recording Tug of War, the former Beatle's first solo album after the breakup of his group Wings.[3][4]\\r\\nJackson stayed at the home of McCartney and his wife Linda during the recording sessions, and became friends with both.[5] While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. \\"This is the way to make big money\\", the musician informed Jackson. \\"Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. Every time someone plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid.\\" McCartney's words influenced Jackson's later purchase of ATV Music Publishing in 1985.[5]\\r\\nMcCartney played several instruments on \\"Say Say Say\\", including percussion, synthesiser, guitar, and bass guitar. The harmonica was played by Chris Smith and the rhythm guitar was played by David Williams. The song was engineered by former Beatles sound engineer, Geoff Emerick.[6] The production of \\"Say Say Say\\" was completed in February 1983, after it had been refined and overdubbed at Cherokee Studios in California.\\r\\nGeorge Martin, who had worked with The Beatles, produced the song. He said of his experience with Jackson, \\"He actually does radiate an aura when he comes into the studio, there's no question about it. He's not a musician in the sense that Paul is?... but he does know what he wants in music and he has very firm ideas.\\"[2][3]\\r\\nJackson also spoke of the experience in his autobiography, Moonwalk. The younger singer revealed that the collaboration boosted his confidence, as Quincy Jonesproducer of Thrillerwas not present to correct his mistakes. Jackson added that he and McCartney worked as equals, stating, \\"Paul never had to carry me in that studio.\\"[7]\\r\\nAccording to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, \\"Say Say Say\\" was performed in common time, with a dance beat of 116?beats per minute.[8] It is in the key of B? minor and sung in a vocal range from F4 to B?5.[8] The lyrics to \\"Say Say Say\\" reflect an attempt to \\"win back\\" a girl's affection; Deseret News considered the song to be a \\"pleading kind of love song\\".[8][9]\\r\\nFollowing the release of Thriller and most of its singles, \\"Say Say Say\\" was released on 3 October 1983 by Parlophone Records in the UK and Columbia Records in the US.[10][11][12] It remained atop Billboard's Hot 100 for six weeks and became Jackson's seventh top ten hit of 1983, breaking a record that until then was held jointly by The Beatles and Elvis Presley.[13][14][15] Also in the US, \\"Say Say Say\\" reached number two on the R&B chart (behind \\"Time Will Reveal\\" by DeBarge) and number three on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart.[16] Although the song had peaked at number ten in the UK, it began to fall steadily; McCartney subsequently held an early weekday live television interview, where he discussed the song's music video. This, along with screenings of the video on Top of the Pops (which normally played only singles that were rising in the charts), The Tube and Noel Edmonds' The Late, Late Breakfast Show, helped propel the song to number two on the UK Singles Chart.[17][18] \\"Say Say Say\\" reached number one in Norway and Sweden, and the single also reached the top ten in Austria, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.[17][19] With wholesale shipments of at least one million units, the single was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.[20]\\r\\n\\"Say Say Say\\" received mixed reviews from music critics. The lyrics were named the worst of 1983 by The Buffalo News's Anthony Violanti,[21] while the Lexington Herald-Leader stated in a review of Pipes of Peace that, aside from \\"Say Say Say\\" and \\"The Man\\", \\"McCartney waste[d] the rest of the album on bathos and whimsy\\".[22] The Los Angeles Times' Paul Grein also reviewed the McCartney album and opined that the singer had redeemed himself with the success of the \\"spunky\\" song \\"but plunged back into wimpdom with 'No More Lonely Nights'\\".[23] Journalist Whitney Pastorek compared the song to McCartney's 1982 duet with Stevie Wonder, \\"Ebony and Ivory\\". She asserted that \\"Say Say Say\\" was a better song, and had a better \\"though slightly more nonsensical\\" music video, adding that the song had no \\"heavy-handed social content\\".[24] Penn State's The Daily Collegian described the track as a good song, despite its ad nauseam broadcasts.[25]\\r\\nDeseret News stated that the \\"pleading love song\\" had a \\"masterful, catchy hook\\".[9] In a Rolling Stone review, the track was described as an \\"amiable though vapid dance groove\\". The reviewer, Parke Puterbaugh, added that it was an \\"instantly hit-bound froth-funk that tends, after all, toward banality\\".[26] Music critic Nelson George stated that \\"Say Say Say\\" would not have \\"deserved the airplay it received without McCartney and Jackson\\".[27] Salon.com later described the song as a \\"sappy duet\\". The online magazine concluded that McCartney had become a \\"wimpy old fart\\".[28] Billboard listed \\"Say Say Say\\" as Michael Jackson's all-time biggest Hot 100 single.[29] In a 2007 article, a writer for the magazine Vibe listed \\"Say Say Say\\" as the 22nd greatest duet of all time. The writer commented that the song was \\"a true falsetto fantasy\\" and that it was \\"still thrilling to hear the sweet-voiced duo trade harmonies on the chorus\\".[30] In 2005, Dutch musicians Hi Tack sampled \\"Say Say Say\\" on their debut single, \\"Say Say Say (Waiting 4 U)\\". The song featured Jackson's vocals from the original recording, plus McCartney's \\"Baby\\".[31]\\r\\nOn October 6, 2015, McCartney released a new version of the song in which the vocal roles of him and Jackson are reversed. It was remixed by Steve Orchard and Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent. On the new version, which is over three minutes longer than the original, the opening of the first is sung by Jackson instead of McCartney. Orchard said of the remix: \\"Paul remembered that there were two unused lead vocal performances by Michael and himself. We rearranged the vocal sequence and inverted the original performance so that Michael opened the first verse instead of Paul, to give the song a different take to the original version.\\"[32] The song appears on the 2015 re-issue of Pipes of Peace.[33] A radio edit of the 2015 remix was released for streaming on October 30, 2015,[34] while an instrumental version of it is available for download at paulmccartney.com.[35]\\r\\nThe music video (or \\"short film\\") for \\"Say Say Say\\" was directed by Bob Giraldi, who had previously directed Michael Jackson's music video for \\"Beat It\\". Cameo appearances in the video are made by McCartney's then wife Linda, as well as Jackson's older sister La Toya.[36][37] According to LaToya Jackson, during filming of the video, the McCartneys were staying at a property named Sycamore Ranch. Michael visited them and expressed interest in someday buying the property. In 1988, he would, renaming it Neverland Ranch.[38] To accommodate Jackson's busy schedule the video was filmed at Los Alamos near Santa Barbara, California. McCartney flew in specially for filming.[39][40] The video cost $500,000 to produce.[17]\\r\\nThe British television premiere of the video was extremely controversial. The video had not been ready when the track debuted in the UK singles chart. By the time it was finalised, the track had dropped in the chart. McCartney flew to London to premiere the video on the BBC1 TV show Top Of The Pops, but the show had a strict policy that no single that had dropped in position could feature on the programme and refused to show it. A furious argument ensued, with claims McCartney threatened to withdraw all his music from the corporation. As a compromise, the BBC offered to air the video two days later on The Late, Late Breakfast Show hosted by Noel Edmonds, a variety show that featured live music performances, but rarely aired videos. They agreed to show it on the programme only if McCartney appeared live and gave an interview. He reluctantly agreed and appeared with his wife Linda live on the show on Saturday, 29 October 1983; his first live UK TV appearance since 1973. The interview was stilted and the McCartneys made little or no effort to answer any of Edmonds' questions. After some reportedly hostile negotiations, the programme's entire show was built around the 'medicine men' theme of the video and the guest who had been booked to appear that week Olivia Newton John had to agree to appear to promote the video in a skit, reportedly against her will and she expressed anger at having her 'starring' role in the show downgraded into a lesser guest spot to make way for the video and McCartney.[41][42][43] The airing of the video on this highly rated show was successful as the track climbed back up the chart the following week and aired on Top Of The Pops on Thursday, 4 November 1983.[44]\\r\\nIn the short film, the duo play \\"Mac and Jack\\", a pair of conmen who sell a \\"miracle potion\\". The salesman (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is \\"guaranteed to give you the strength of a raging bull\\". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the manalong with Lindais also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage.[40] After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar.[45] On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes.[46] Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya.[47] When law-enforcement officers appear at the back of the venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers \\"FIRE!\\", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (yet somehow finding time to change into tuxedoes first). The video ends with Paul, Linda, and Michael as they drive off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.[45]\\r\\nThe video also features appearances by director Giraldi as a pool shark who is conned by McCartney, and Art Carney as an audience member for the vaudeville show.[48]\\r\\nGiraldi said of Jackson and McCartney, \\"Michael didn't outdance Paul, and Paul didn't outsing Michael\\". He added that production of the video was hard work because \\"the egos could fill a room\\".[49] The video introduced both dialogue and storyline, an element extended upon in Michael Jackson's Thriller.[50] In a 1984 study of music videos conducted by the National Coalition on Television Violence, the Jacksons were rated \\"very violent,\\" citing Michael Jackson's \\"Billie Jean,\\" \\"Thriller\\", and \\"Say Say Say\\" as well as Jermaine Jackson's \\"Dynamite\\" and the Jacksons' \\"Torture.\\"[51] In a list compiled by Billboard at the end of 1984, the music video was named the fourth best of the year, and the rest of the top four were also short films by Jackson.[52]\\r\\nThe Manchester Evening News later described the \\"Say Say Say\\" video as an \\"anarchic caper\\" that \\"plays out like an Emir Kusturica feature\\".[53] PopMatters stated that the music videos of \\"Say Say Say\\" and \\"Goodnight Tonight\\" turned \\"a pair of otherwise forgettable songs into something worth watching\\".[54] Steven Greenlee of The Boston Globe reflected that the video was both \\"horrifying and compelling\\", and stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating somebody at arm wrestling. He added, \\"It's even harder to believe that the two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of Chess King employees\\".[55] The \\"Say Say Say\\" video was later included on the DVDs The McCartney Years and Michael Jackson's Vision.[56]\\r\\nTwo authors later reviewed the short film and documented two central themes. The first is a \\"Child/Man\\" theme; the role of both a boy and an adult, which writer James M. Curtis states Jackson plays throughout the music video for \\"Say Say Say\\".[45] Curtis writes that the bathroom scene involving the shaving foam is reminiscent of boys copying their fathers. He adds that the scene marks \\"the distinction between Michael's roles as a Child and as a Man\\". The writer also highlights the part where the singer supposedly becomes strengthened with a miracle potion, a further play on the \\"Child/Man\\" theme.[45] Furthermore, Curtis observes that Paul and Linda McCartney seem to act as if they are Jackson's parents in the short film.[45] The author also notes that in a scene where Jackson is handed a bouquet of flowers from a girl, it is a reversal of one from City Lights, a 1931 film starring Charlie Chaplin, whom the singer greatly adored.[45]\\r\\nThe second of the two main themes in the music video is of African American history and culture, as some of the vaudeville scenes in the short film acknowledge minstrel shows and blackface.[46] Author W. T. Lhamon writes that the video is set in the Californian Depression, and that McCartney and Jackson \\"convey a compactly corrupt history of blackface\\" as they con their way to riches with the Mac and Jack show.[46] Lhamon was critical of the pair and of the video because he felt that the African American theme had not been made explicitly known. The author expressed his view that aspects of the short film were historically out-of-synch with interracial relations.[46] He stated, \\"Nearly everything in the video is backward. Mack's white hand continually helping black Jack on board, for instance, reverses the general process I have shown of blacks providing whites with their sustaining gestures.\\"[46] Lhamon added, \\"In a just world, Jackson should be pulling McCartney onto the wagon, not the other way around.\\"[46]\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone\\r\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\r\\nBibliography","input":"What did michael jackson and paul mccartney sing together?"},{"output":"September 9, 1969","context":"The Official Languages Act (French: Loi sur les langues officielles) is a Canadian law that came into force on September 9, 1969,[1] which gives French and English equal status in the government of Canada.[2] This makes them \\"official\\" languages, having preferred status in law over all other languages. Although the Official Languages Act is not the only piece of federal language law, it is the legislative keystone of Canada's official bilingualism. It was substantially amended in 1988. Both languages are equal in Canada's government and in all the services it controls, such as the courts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Act[3] provides, among other things,\\r\\nThe Federal government has set in place regulations establishing linguistic categories (anglophone, francophone, bilingual) for some job functions within the public service. Departments and agencies of the federal government are required to fill these positions with individuals who are capable of serving the public in English, in French, or in both languages. Unilingual public servants are given incentives to learn the other official language, and the government provides language training and offers a \\"bilingualism bonus\\".\\r\\nPart VI of the Act mandates that English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians not be discriminated against based on ethnic origin or first language learned when it comes to employment opportunities and advancement.[4]\\r\\nAs well, the law created the Commissioner of Official Languages, an officer of Parliament charged with receiving complaints from the public, undertaking inquiries, and making recommendations regarding the status of the two official languages.\\r\\nSection 32 of the Official Languages Act authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal cabinet) to issue regulations defining the geographic regions in which services will be offered by the federal government in the relevant minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere).[5] This provides a legal definition for the otherwise vague requirement that services be provided in the minority official languages wherever there is \\"significant demand.\\" The definition used in the regulations is complex, but basically an area of the country is served in both languages if at least 5,000 persons in that area, or 5% of the local population (whichever is smaller), belongs to that province's English or French linguistic minority population.[6] The regulations were first promulgated in 1991.[7]\\r\\nThe Official Languages Act was one of the cornerstones of the government of Pierre Trudeau. The law was an attempt to implement some of the policy objectives outlined by the federally commissioned Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, which had been established in 1963 and since that time had been issuing periodic reports on the inequitable manner in which Canadas English-speaking and French-speaking populations were treated by the federal administration. At that time, only 9% of jobs within the federal public service were occupied by Francophones,[8] even though French-speakers formed a quarter of the Canadian population. The proportion of jobs designated bilingual grew to 14% in 1978, and to 25% in 2004.[9]\\r\\nOne of the most important features of the 1969 act was to ensure that federal government services would be provided in both official languages, wherever population size warranted it.\\r\\nIts principles were later incorporated into the Constitution of Canada, in Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\\r\\nA new Official Languages Act was enacted in 1988 in order to achieve two objectives.\\r\\nFirst, it was necessary to update the 1969 law to take into account the new language-related obligations that the federal government had undertaken under Sections 16-23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which had been enacted in 1982. For example, Section 20 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is \\"a significant demand for communication with and services from that office.\\" Significant demand is not defined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the purposes of the Official Languages Act of 1988 was to remedy this omission.\\r\\nSecond, the new law included provisions for the promotion by the government of Canada of Quebecs English-speaking minority and of the French-speaking minorities in the rest of the country. The programs that fall under the \\"promotion\\" umbrella are often designed to encourage each provincial government to offer services to its official-language minority community, and contain a mechanism for transferring funds to the provincial governments in order to finance a part of these programs. Under Canadas federal constitution, many important services, such as education and health, fall under provincial jurisdiction and are therefore off-limits to any direct federal spending. The transfer of federal funds, conditional upon the fulfilment by each provincial government of detailed conditions laid out in a funding agreement, is a constitutionally permitted method of dodging this jurisdictional constraint.\\r\\nThis would suggest that the Official Languages Act and Quebec's Charter of the French Language (also known as \\"Bill 101\\") are fundamentally at cross-purposes with each other. However, that perspective is not universally accepted. For example, former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff has stated that \\"Bill 101 and the Official Languages Act are not in opposition, they are complementary.\\"[10]\\r\\nFrom time to time, the Official Languages Commissioner draws attention to the fact that federal agencies subject to the law are failing to live up to their legal obligations regarding official languages. In a report published in 2004 on the 35th anniversary of the Official Languages Act, Commissioner Dyane Adam noted that only 86% of posts designated \\"bilingual\\" in the federal public service were occupied by persons who had effectively mastered the two official languages. This nevertheless was an increase over the comparable figure of 1978, when only 70% of the incumbents in posts that had been designated \\"bilingual\\" were capable of speaking both languages at accepted levels.[11]\\r\\nPrime Minister Trudeau, recently asked in English to address a lack of government services for persons who speak only English, answered the question in French.[12]\\r\\nIn 1969, the law was adopted with all-party support in the House of Commons. Despite this, there was not universal support for the law. The premiers of the three Prairie provinces requested, early in 1969, that the Official Languages Bill be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada to determine its constitutionality. They maintained, along with JT Thorson, the former president of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that the bill was outside the powers of the Parliament of Canada.[13] The reference to the court was never made, but the legal question was resolved in 1974, when the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, that the subject matter of the bill was within federal jurisdiction.\\r\\nIn subsequent decades the response from provincial governments to the example set by the federal government has been mixed:\\r\\nPublic support for bilingual services had dramatically increased between the mid-1960s and the end of the 1970s. There is no direct polling on the popularity of the Official Languages Act itself, but poll data on related questions gives an indication of a significant shift in the attitudes of English-speaking Canadians. A 1965 poll showed that 17% of Canadians living outside Quebec favoured the use of public funds to finance French-language schools. This proportion had risen to 77% by 1977 (albeit in response to a slightly different question about support for provincial governments offering services in French \\"where possible\\").[14]\\r\\nWithin Quebec, changes to the treatment of French-speakers within the federal public service were met with approval mixed with a media scepticism that this actually helped the unilingual French-speaking majority of Quebecers, who continued to be excluded from some federal jobs designated \\"bilingual\\", since by definition a \\"bilingual\\" job requires the use of English, and is therefore closed to a unilingual Francophone. That obviously unilingual anglophones are excluded as well is rarely mentioned, or that because of the vastly higher rate of bilingualism among Francophones than Anglophones, the result had been a disproportionally higher representation of Francophones in the federal sector. Anglo and Allophones, conversely, became drastically under-represented in the province of Quebec.\\r\\nAt any rate, the adoption of official bilingualism at the federal level did nothing to slow the rise of the separatist movement. The separatist Parti Qubcois made its first significant electoral breakthrough less than a year after the Official Languages Act was adopted, winning 23% of the vote in Quebecs 1970 provincial election and replacing the Union Nationale as the main electoral vehicle for Quebec nationalism. Six years later, the separatists came to power in the 1976 provincial election.\\r\\nEven today, support for official bilingualism has not achieved consensus levels in English-speaking Canada. According to a poll conducted in 2002, 98% of Quebecers consider official bilingualism to be \\"very important\\" or \\"somewhat important\\". This proportion drops to 76% in the Atlantic provinces, 72% in Ontario, 67% in the Prairie Provinces, and 63% in British Columbia.[15] Another poll, conducted in 2000, shows that more than half of Canadians outside Quebec believe that too much effort has gone into promoting bilingualism. By contrast, only 26% of Quebecers shared this view.[16]","input":"When did french become official language of canada?"},{"output":"after the 1902 season","context":"","input":"When did the yankees become a baseball team?"},{"output":"Upon closure at birth","context":"In the developing fetus, the ductus arteriosus, also called the ductus Botalli, is a blood vessel connecting the main pulmonary artery to the proximal descending aorta. It allows most of the blood from the right ventricle to bypass the fetus's fluid-filled non-functioning lungs. Upon closure at birth, it becomes the ligamentum arteriosum. There are two other fetal shunts, the ductus venosus and the foramen ovale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ductus arteriosus is formed from the left 6th aortic arch during embryonic development[1] and attaches to the final part of the aortic arch (the isthmus of aorta) and the first part of the pulmonary artery[2]\\r\\nFailure of the DA to close after birth results in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus and the generation of a left-to-right shunt. If left uncorrected, patency leads to pulmonary hypertension and possibly congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias.\\r\\nThe E series of prostaglandins are responsible for maintaining the patency of the DA (by dilation of vascular smooth muscle) throughout the fetal period.[3] Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), produced by both the placenta and the DA itself, is the most potent of the E prostaglandins, but prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) also has a role in keeping the DA open.[4] PGE1 and PGE2 keep the DA open via involvement of specific PGE-sensitive receptors (such as EP4 and EP2).[5] EP4 is the major receptor associated with PGE2-induced dilation of the DA and can be found across the DA in smooth muscle cells.[6] Immediately after birth, the levels of both PGE2 and the EP4 receptors reduce significantly, allowing for closure of the DA and establishment of normal postnatal circulation.[6] According to one study, median DA persistency times were 27.42 and 45.10?h after birth in boys and girls, respectively. A statistically significant sex difference was observed (p<0.0001). Additionally, significant time differences were observed between vaginal and scheduled caesarean deliveries, at 26.97 and 28.93?h, respectively (p=0.0245).[7]\\r\\nIn some types of congenital heart defect (e.g., transposition of the great arteries), prostaglandins may be administered to maintain DA patency, allowing for the continual circulation and oxygenation of blood, until surgery can be performed.[8]\\r\\nDA closure may be induced by administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which inhibit prostaglandin production.[4] The most common NSAID that is used to force DA closure is Indomethacin (a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor), which can be administered after birth (used in first week of life).[4] However, in the presence of a congenital defect with impaired lung perfusion (e.g. Pulmonary stenosis and left-to-right shunt through the ductus), it may be advisable to improve oxygenation by maintaining the ductus open with prostaglandin treatment. However, such treatments are ineffective in an abnormal ductus. Persistence of the ductus may be associated with other abnormalities, and is much more common in females. By inhibiting PGE2 formation, EP4 receptor activation will decrease and normal circulation can begin. NSAIDs taken late in pregnancy can cross the placenta and lead to premature closure of the DA in the fetus.[9] In this case, exogenous PDE2 can be administered to reverse the effects of the NSAIDs and maintain the patency of the DA for the remainder of the pregnancy.[4]\\r\\nA patent ductus arteriosus affects approximately 4% of infants with Down syndrome (DS). A failure to thrive is a very common sign of this condition.[10]","input":"When is the ductus arteriosis normally renamed the ligamentum arteriosum?"},{"output":"March 2000","context":"The London Eye, known for sponsorship reasons as the Coca-Cola London Eye, is a giant Ferris wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London.\\r\\nThe structure is 443 feet (135?m) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 394 feet (120?m). When it opened to the public in 2000 it was the world's tallest Ferris wheel. Its height was surpassed by the 525-foot (160?m) Star of Nanchang in 2006, the 541-foot (165?m) Singapore Flyer in 2008, and the 550-foot (167.6?m) High Roller (Las Vegas) in 2014. Supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the taller Nanchang and Singapore wheels, the Eye is described by its operators as \\"the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel\\".[10]\\r\\nIt is Europe's tallest Ferris wheel,[11] and offered the highest public viewing point in London[12] until it was superseded by the 804-foot (245?m) high[13] observation deck on the 72nd floor of The Shard, which opened to the public on 1 February 2013.[14] It is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3.75?million visitors annually,[15] and has made many appearances in popular culture.\\r\\nThe London Eye adjoins the western end of Jubilee Gardens (previously the site of the former Dome of Discovery), on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge beside County Hall, in the London Borough of Lambeth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA predecessor to the London Eye, the Great Wheel, was built for the Empire of India Exhibition at Earls Court and opened to the public on 17 July 1895.[16] Modelled on the original Chicago Ferris Wheel, it was 94 metres (308?ft) tall[17] and 82.3 metres (270?ft) in diameter.[18][19][20] It stayed in service until 1906, by which time its 40 cars (each with a capacity of 40 persons) had carried over 2.5?million passengers. The Great Wheel was demolished in 1907[21] following its last use at the Imperial Austrian Exhibition.[22]\\r\\nThe London Eye was designed by the husband-and-wife team of Julia Barfield and David Marks of Marks Barfield Architects.[23][24]\\r\\nMace was responsible for construction management, with Hollandia as the main steelwork contractor and Tilbury Douglas as the civil contractor. Consulting engineers Tony Gee & Partners designed the foundation works while Beckett Rankine designed the marine works.[25]\\r\\nNathaniel Lichfield and Partners assisted The Tussauds Group in obtaining planning and listed building consent to alter the wall on the South Bank of the Thames. They also examined and reported on the implications of a Section 106 agreement attached to the original contract, and also prepared planning and listed building consent applications for the permanent retention of the attraction, which involved the co-ordination of an Environmental Statement and the production of a planning supporting statement detailing the reasons for its retention.[26]\\r\\nThe rim of the Eye is supported by tensioned steel cables[27] and resembles a huge spoked bicycle wheel. The lighting was redone with LED lighting from Color Kinetics in December 2006 to allow digital control of the lights as opposed to the manual replacement of gels over fluorescent tubes.[28]\\r\\nThe wheel was constructed in sections which were floated up the Thames on barges and assembled lying flat on piled platforms in the river. Once the wheel was complete it was lifted into an upright position by a strand jack system made by Enerpac.[29] It was first raised at 2?degrees per hour until it reached 65?degrees, then left in that position for a week while engineers prepared for the second phase of the lift. The project was European with major components coming from six countries: the steel was supplied from the UK and fabricated in The Netherlands by the Dutch company Hollandia, the cables came from Italy, the bearings came from Germany (FAG/Schaeffler Group), the spindle and hub were cast in the Czech Republic, the capsules were made by Poma in France (and the glass for these came from Italy), and the electrical components from the UK.[30]\\r\\nThe London Eye was formally opened by then Prime Minister Tony Blair on 31 December 1999, but did not open to the paying public until 9 March 2000 because of a capsule clutch problem.[2]\\r\\nOn 5 June 2008 it was announced that 30?million people had ridden the London Eye since it opened.[31]\\r\\nThe wheel's 32 sealed and air-conditioned ovoidal passenger capsules, designed[32] and supplied[33] by Poma, are attached to the external circumference of the wheel and rotated by electric motors. Each of the 10-tonne (11-short-ton)[34] capsules represents one of the London Boroughs,[27] and holds up to 25 people,[35] who are free to walk around inside the capsule, though seating is provided. The wheel rotates at 26?cm (10?in) per second (about 0.9?kph or 0.6?mph) so that one revolution takes about 30?minutes. It does not usually stop to take on passengers; the rotation rate is slow enough to allow passengers to walk on and off the moving capsules at ground level.[34] It is, however, stopped to allow disabled or elderly passengers time to embark and disembark safely.[36]\\r\\nIn 2009 the first stage of a S12.5?million capsule upgrade began. Each capsule was taken down and floated down the river to Tilbury Docks in Essex.[37]\\r\\nOn 2 June 2013 a passenger capsule was named the Coronation Capsule to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.[38]\\r\\nMarks Barfield (the lead architects), The Tussauds Group, and British Airways were the original owners of the London Eye.[39] Tussauds bought out British Airways in 2005[39] and then Marks Barfield in 2006[40] to become sole owner.\\r\\nIn May 2007, the Blackstone Group purchased The Tussauds Group which was then the owner of the Eye; Tussauds was merged with Blackstone's Merlin Entertainments and disappeared as an entity.[41][42] British Airways continued its brand association, but from the beginning of 2008 the name British Airways was dropped from the logo.[43]\\r\\nOn 12 August 2009 the London Eye saw another rebrand, this time being called \\"The Merlin Entertainments London Eye\\" to showcase Merlin Entertainments' ownership. A new logo was designed for the attractionthis time taking the form of an eye made out of London's famous landmarks. This coincided with the launch of Merlin Entertainments 4D Experience preflight show underneath the ticket centre in County Hall. The refurbished ticket hall and 4D cinema experience were designed by architect Kay Elliott working with Merlin Studios project designer Craig Sciba. Merlin Studios later appointed Simex-Iwerks as the 4D theatre hardware specialists. The film was written and directed by 3D director Julian Napier and 3D produced by Phil Streather.[44]\\r\\nIn January 2011, a lighting-up ceremony marked the start of a three-year deal between EDF Energy and Merlin Entertainments.[45][46] On 1 August 2014 the logo was reverted to the previous \\"The Merlin Entertainments London Eye\\" version, with the name becoming simply \\"The London Eye\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Coca-Cola signed an agreement to sponsor the London Eye for two years, starting from January 2015. On the day of the announcement, the London Eye was lit in red.[47]\\r\\nOn 20 May 2005, there were reports of a leaked letter showing that the South Bank Centre (SBC)owners of part of the land on which the struts of the Eye are locatedhad served a notice to quit on the attraction along with a demand for an increase in rent from S64,000 per year to S2.5?million, which the operators rejected as unaffordable.[48]\\r\\nOn 25 May 2005, London mayor Ken Livingstone vowed that the landmark would remain in London. He also pledged that if the dispute was not resolved he would use his powers to ask the London Development Agency to issue a compulsory purchase order.[49] The land in question is a small part of the Jubilee Gardens, which was given to the SBC for S1 when the Greater London Council was broken up.\\r\\nThe South Bank Centre and the British Airways London Eye agreed on a 25-year lease on 8 February 2006 after a judicial review over the rent dispute. The lease agreement meant that the South Bank Centre, a publicly funded charity, would receive at least S500,000 a year from the attraction, the status of which is secured for the foreseeable future. Tussauds also announced the acquisition of the entire one-third interests of British Airways and Marks Barfield in the Eye as well as the outstanding debt to BA. These agreements gave Tussauds 100% ownership and resolved the debt from the Eye's construction loan from British Airways, which stood at more than S150?million by mid-2005 and had been increasing at 25% per annum.[50]\\r\\nSir Richard Rogers, winner of the 2007 Pritzker Architecture Prize, wrote of the London Eye in a book about the project:\\r\\nThe Eye has done for London what the Eiffel Tower did for Paris, which is to give it a symbol and to let people climb above the city and look back down on it. Not just specialists or rich people, but everybody. That's the beauty of it: it is public and accessible, and it is in a great position at the heart of London.[51]\\r\\nWriting for G2 in an article from August 2007, Steve Rose described the Eye as follows:\\r\\nThe Eye... exists in a category of its own.... It essentially has to fulfil only one function, and what a brilliantly inessential function it is: to lift people up from the ground, take them round a giant loop in the sky, then put them back down where they started.

This special was broadcast May 16, 1983.[2] It subsequently became his signature move.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn illusion is involved in creating the appearance of the dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front foot is held flat on the ground, while the back foot is in a tiptoe position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back foot. What is now the front foot is lowered flat, while the back foot is raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow moonwalking to appear to glide forward, sideways, or even in a circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many recorded instances of the moonwalk; similar steps are reported as far back as 1932, used by Cab Calloway.[5] In 1985, Calloway said that the move was called \\"The Buzz\\" when he and others performed it in the 1930s.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1944, Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien featured something like the move in their performance of \\"Under the Bamboo Tree\\" in Meet Me in St. Louis, though their performance lacks the illusion created by the genuine moonwalk.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Dick Van Dyke performed a similar variation of the moonwalk and camel walk in his comedy routine called \\"Mailing A Letter On A Windy Corner\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1955, it was recorded in a performance by tap dancer Bill Bailey. He performs a tap routine, and at the end, backslides into the wings.[9] The French mime artist Marcel Marceau used it throughout his career (from the 1940s through the 1980s), as part of the drama of his mime routines. In Marceau's \\"Walking Against the Wind\\" routine, he pretends to be pushed backwards by a gust of wind.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1958, Mexican dancer-comedian Adalberto Martinez \\"Resortes\\" also performed the moonwalk in the film Colegio de Verano (Summer School).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a November 1969 episode of H.R.

In 1981 in the promotional single and music video Crosseyed and Painless by new wave band Talking Heads, authentic street dancers, picked by David Byrne, are featuring, including Stephen \\"Skeeter Rabbit\\" Nichols doing the moonwalk.[15] It reached to 20 on the US dance charts. Another early moonwalker was popper and singer Jeffrey Daniel, who moonwalked in a performance of Shalamar's \\"A Night To Remember\\" on Top of the Pops in the UK in 1982[16] and was known to perform backslides in public performances (including weekly Soul Train episodes) as far back as 1974. Michael Jackson was a fan of Jeffrey Daniel's dancing and would eventually seek him out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso in 1982, Debbie Allen performs a moonwalk during a scene with Gwen Verdon in Season 1, Episode 10 (\\"Come One, Come All\\") of the TV series Fame.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Flashdance, the move was used in the B-boy scene, where Rock Steady Crew's Mr. Freeze (Marc Lemberger), with an umbrella prop, mimed the wind blowing him backward as he first walks forward, fighting the wind, then starts moonwalking backwards. Mr. Freeze's version was also shown in the first hip hop movie Wild Style and Malcolm McLaren film clip \\"Buffalo Gals\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeffrey Daniel taught Michael Jackson the moonwalk. He saw Jeffrey do the moonwalk dance on Soul Train, so he had his manager call Soul Train to introduce him to the dancer. Jeffrey was touring with Shalamar at the time so Cooley Jackson and Caszper Candidate went to teach Jackson. However, Michael was not able to pick up and master the technique until Jeffrey returned from tour and worked with him.[citation needed] The dance was popularized in 1983 when Jackson performed it during a television special, Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever, on March 25 of that year. Dressed in his signature black trousers, silver socks, silver shirt, black-sequined jacket, sequined glove, and black fedora, Jackson spun around, posed, and began moonwalking. Music critic Ian Inglis later wrote that Jackson encapsulated a long tradition of African-American dance movements in that one performance.[14] The audience cheered Michael's moonwalk. Moonwalking received widespread attention, and from then on, the moonwalk became Jackson's signature move for his song \\"Billie Jean\\". Nelson George said that Jackson's rendition \\"combined Jackie Wilson's athleticism with James Brown's camel walk\\".

The members of the Sharks, from Puerto Rico, are taunted by the Jets, a white gang.[4] The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang's leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks.

The production was nominated for six Tony Awards including Best Musical in 1957,[5] but the award for Best Musical went to Meredith Willson's The Music Man. Robbins won the Tony Award for his choreography and Oliver Smith won for his scenic designs. The show had an even longer-running London production, a number of revivals and international productions. A 1961 musical film of the same name, directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, starred Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won ten, including George Chakiris for Supporting Actor, Rita Moreno for Supporting Actress, and Best Picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1947, Jerome Robbins approached Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents about collaborating on a contemporary musical adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. He proposed that the plot focus on the conflict between an Irish Catholic family and a Jewish family living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan,[6] during the EasterÿPassover season. The girl has survived the Holocaust and emigrated from Israel; the conflict was to be centered around anti-Semitism of the Catholic \\"Jets\\" towards the Jewish \\"Emeralds\\" (a name that made its way into the script as a reference).[7] Eager to write his first musical, Laurents immediately agreed. Bernstein wanted to present the material in operatic form, but Robbins and Laurents resisted the suggestion. They described the project as \\"lyric theater\\", and Laurents wrote a first draft he called East Side Story. Only after he completed it did the group realize it was little more than a musicalization of themes that had already been covered in plays like Abie's Irish Rose. When he opted to drop out, the three men went their separate ways, and the piece was shelved for almost five years.[8][9]\\r\\nIn 1955, theatrical producer Martin Gabel was working on a stage adaptation of the James M. Cain novel Serenade, about an opera singer who comes to the realization he is homosexual, and he invited Laurents to write the book. Laurents accepted and suggested Bernstein and Robbins join the creative team. Robbins felt if the three were going to join forces, they should return to East Side Story, and Bernstein agreed. Laurents, however, was committed to Gabel, who introduced him to the young composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim auditioned by playing the score for Saturday Night, his musical that was scheduled to open in the fall. Laurents liked the lyrics but was not impressed with the music. Sondheim did not care for Laurents' opinion. Serenade ultimately was shelved.[10]\\r\\nLaurents was soon hired to write the screenplay for a remake of the 1934 Greta Garbo film The Painted Veil for Ava Gardner. While in Hollywood, he contacted Bernstein, who was in town conducting at the Hollywood Bowl. The two met at The Beverly Hills Hotel, and the conversation turned to juvenile delinquent gangs, a fairly recent social phenomenon that had received major coverage on the front pages of the morning newspapers due to a Chicano turf war. Bernstein suggested they rework East Side Story and set it in Los Angeles, but Laurents felt he was more familiar with Puerto Rican immigrants and Harlem than he was with Mexican Americans and Olvera Street. The two contacted Robbins, who was enthusiastic about a musical with a Latin beat. He arrived in Hollywood to choreograph the dance sequences for The King and I, and he and Laurents began developing the musical while working on their respective projects, keeping in touch with Bernstein, who had returned to New York. When the producer of The Painted Veil replaced Gardner with Eleanor Parker and asked Laurents to revise his script with her in mind, he backed out of the film, freeing him to devote all his time to the stage musical.[11]\\r\\nIn New York City, Laurents went to the opening night party for a new play by Ugo Betti, and there he met Sondheim, who had heard that East Side Story, now retitled West Side Story, was back on track. Bernstein had decided he needed to concentrate solely on the music, and he and Robbins had invited Betty Comden and Adolph Green to write the lyrics, but the team opted to work on Peter Pan instead. Laurents asked Sondheim if he would be interested in tackling the task. Initially he resisted, because he was determined to write the full score for his next project (Saturday Night had been aborted), but Oscar Hammerstein convinced him that he would benefit from the experience, and he accepted.[12] Meanwhile, Laurents had written a new draft of the book changing the characters' backgrounds: Anton, once an Irish American, was now of Polish and Irish descent, and the formerly Jewish Maria had become a Puerto Rican.[13]\\r\\nThe original book Laurents wrote closely adhered to Romeo and Juliet, but the characters based on Rosaline and the parents of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; four-letter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: \\"cut the frabba-jabba\\", for example.[14] Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like \\"A boy like that would kill your brother\\", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move \\"One Hand, One Heart\\", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result \\"Tonight\\" was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to \\"America\\" and \\"I Feel Pretty\\" were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, \\"Kid Stuff\\", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.[15]\\r\\nBernstein composed West Side Story and Candide concurrently, which led to some switches of material between the two works.[16] Tony and Maria's duet, \\"One Hand, One Heart\\", was originally intended for Cunegonde in Candide. The music of \\"Gee, Officer Krupke\\" was pulled from the Venice scene in Candide.[17] Laurents explained the style that the creative team finally decided on:\\r\\nJust as Tony and Maria, our Romeo and Juliet, set themselves apart from the other kids by their love, so we have tried to set them even further apart by their language, their songs, their movement. Wherever possible in the show, we have tried to heighten emotion or to articulate inarticulate adolescence through music, song or dance.[18]\\r\\nThe show was nearly complete in the fall of 1956, but almost everyone on the creative team needed to fulfill other commitments first. Robbins was involved with Bells Are Ringing, then Bernstein with Candide, and in January 1957 A Clearing in the Woods, Laurents' latest play, opened and quickly closed.[19] When a backers' audition failed to raise any money for West Side Story late in the spring of 1957, only two months before the show was to begin rehearsals, producer Cheryl Crawford pulled out of the project.[20] Every other producer had already turned down the show, deeming it too dark and depressing. Bernstein was despondent, but Sondheim convinced his friend Hal Prince, who was in Boston overseeing the out-of-town tryout of the new George Abbott musical New Girl in Town, to read the script. He liked it but decided to ask Abbott, his longtime mentor, for his opinion, and Abbott advised him to turn it down. Prince, aware that Abbott was the primary reason New Girl was in trouble, decided to ignore him, and he and his producing partner Robert Griffith flew to New York to hear the score.[21] In his memoirs, Prince recalled, \\"Sondheim and Bernstein sat at the piano playing through the music, and soon I was singing along with them.\\"[17]\\r\\nPrince began cutting the budget and raising money. Robbins then announced he did not want to choreograph the show, but changed his mind when Prince agreed to an eight-week dance rehearsal period (instead of the customary four), since there was to be more dancing in West Side Story than in any previous Broadway show,[17] and allowed Robbins to hire Peter Gennaro as his assistant.[22] Originally, when considering the cast, Laurents wanted James Dean for the lead role of Tony, but the actor soon died. Sondheim found Larry Kert and Chita Rivera, who created the roles of Tony and Anita, respectively. Getting the work on stage was still not easy. Bernstein said:\\r\\nEveryone told us that [West Side Story] was an impossible project ... And we were told no one was going to be able to sing augmented fourths, as with \\"Ma-ri-a\\" ... Also, they said the score was too rangy for pop music ... Besides, who wanted to see a show in which the first-act curtain comes down on two dead bodies lying on the stage?... And then we had the really tough problem of casting it, because the characters had to be able not only to sing but dance and act and be taken for teenagers. Ultimately, some of the cast were teenagers, some were 21, some were 30 but looked 16. Some were wonderful singers but couldn't dance very well, or vice versa ... and if they could do both, they couldn't act.[23]\\r\\nThroughout the rehearsal period, the New York newspapers were filled with articles about gang warfare, keeping the show's plot timely. Robbins kept the cast members playing the Sharks and the Jets separate in order to discourage them from socializing with each other and reminded everyone of the reality of gang violence by posting news stories on the bulletin board backstage.[24] Robbins wanted a gritty realism from his sneaker- and jeans-clad cast. He gave the ensemble more freedom than Broadway dancers had previously been given to interpret their roles, and the dancers were thrilled to be treated like actors instead of just choreographed bodies.[25] As the rehearsals wore on, Bernstein fought to keep his score together, as other members of the team called on him to cut out more and more of the sweeping or complex \\"operatic\\" passages.[17] Columbia Records initially declined to record the cast album, saying the score was too depressing and too difficult.[7]\\r\\nThere were problems with Oliver Smith's designs. His painted backdrops were stunning, but the sets were, for the most part, either shabby looking or too stylized. Prince refused to spend money on new construction, and Smith was obliged to improve what he had as best he could with very little money to do it.[26] The pre-Broadway run in Washington, D.C. was a critical and commercial success, although none of the reviews mentioned Sondheim, listed as co-lyricist, who was overshadowed by the better-known Bernstein. Bernstein magnanimously removed his name as co-author of the lyrics, although Sondheim was uncertain he wanted to receive sole credit for what he considered to be overly florid contributions by Bernstein. Robbins demanded and received a \\"Conceived by\\" credit, and used it to justify his making major decisions regarding changes in the show without consulting the others. As a result, by opening night on Broadway, none of his collaborators were talking to him.[27]\\r\\nIt has been rumored that while Bernstein was off trying to fix the musical Candide, Sondheim wrote some of the music for West Side Story, and that Bernstein's co-lyricist billing mysteriously disappeared from the credits of West Side Story during the tryout, presumably as a trade-off.[28] However, Suskin writes in Show Tunes that \\"As the writing progressed and the extent of Bernstein's lyric contributions became less, the composer agreed to rescind his credit...Contrary to rumor, Sondheim did not write music for the show; his only contribution came on \\"Something's Coming\\", where he developed the main strain of the chorus from music Bernstein wrote for the verse.[29])\\r\\nTwo rival teenage gangs, the Jets (White Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants), struggle for control of the neighborhood somewhere in the Upper West Side of New York City amidst the police (Prologue). They are warned by Lt. Schrank and Officer Krupke to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (\\"Jet Song\\"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (\\"Something's Coming\\").\\r\\nMaria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo's. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.\\r\\nAt the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (\\"Dance at the Gym\\"), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love, but Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom (\\"Maria\\"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (\\"Tonight\\"). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (\\"America\\").\\r\\nThe Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc's Drug Store. Riff helps them let out their aggression (\\"Cool\\"). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests \\"a fair fight\\" (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members' protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff's second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.\\r\\nThe next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again. However, she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita and is dismayed. When Tony arrives, Maria asks him to stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (\\"One Hand, One Heart\\"). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (\\"Tonight Quintet\\"). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony's defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (\\"The Rumble\\"). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The tomboy Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and flees with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain.\\r\\nBlissfully unaware of the gangs' plans for that night, Maria daydreams with her friends, Rosalia, Consuelo, Teresita and Francisca, about seeing Tony (\\"I Feel Pretty\\"). Later, as Maria dances on the roof happily because she has seen Tony and believes he went to stop the rumble, Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo. Maria flees to her bedroom, praying that Chino is lying. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (\\"Somewhere\\").\\r\\nTwo of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Officer Krupke, and the other adults who don't understand them (\\"Gee, Officer Krupke\\"). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino is looking for Tony with a gun. The gang separates to find Tony. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.\\r\\nA grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (\\"A Boy Like That\\"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (\\"I Have a Love\\"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually simulate rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Anita is furious, and in anger spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.\\r\\nDoc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of \\"Somewhere\\") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that \\"all of [them]\\" killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, \\"Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!\\" she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nAfter tryouts in Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia beginning in August 1957, the original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 26, 1957 to positive reviews. The production was directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, produced by Robert E. Griffith and Harold Prince with lighting designed by Jean Rosenthal. The cast starred Larry Kert as Tony, Carol Lawrence as Maria, Chita Rivera as Anita and David Winters as Baby John.[30] The other notable cast members in the original production were: Riff: Michael Callan, A-Rab: Tony Mordente, Big Deal: Martin Charnin, Gee-Tar: Tommy Abbott, Chino: Jamie Sanchez, Rosalia: Marilyn Cooper, Consuela [sic]: Reri Grist and Doc: Art Smith.[31] The production closed on June 27, 1959, after 732 performances.[30] Robbins won the Tony Award for Best Choreographer, and Oliver Smith won the Tony for Best Scenic Designer. Also nominated were Carol Lawrence, as Best Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, Max Goberman as Best Musical Director and Conductor, and Irene Sharaff for Best Costume Design.[30] Carol Lawrence received the 1958 Theatre World Award.\\r\\nThe production toured and then returned to the Winter Garden Theatre in April 1960 for another 249 performance engagement.[32] Several dances from West Side Story were included in the Tony Award-winning 1989 Broadway production, Jerome Robbins' Broadway.\\r\\nThe 1958 European premiere at the Manchester Opera House transferred to London, where it opened at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End on December 12, 1958 and ran until June 1961 with a total of 1,039 performances. Robbins directed and choreographed, and it was co-choreographed by Peter Gennaro, with scenery by Oliver Smith. Featured performers were George Chakiris, who won an Academy Award as Bernardo in the 1961 film version, as Riff, Marlys Watters as Maria, Don McKay as Tony, and Chita Rivera reprising her Broadway role as Anita.[33] David Holliday, who had been playing Gladhand since the London opening, took over as Tony.\\r\\nA UK national tour started in 1997 and starred David Habbin as Tony, Katie Knight Adams as Maria and Anna-Jane Casey as Anita. The production transferred to London's West End opening at the Prince Edward Theatre in October 1998, transferring to the Prince of Wales Theatre where it closed in January 2000. The production subsequently toured the UK for a second time.[34]\\r\\nA Broadway revival opened at the Minskoff Theatre on February 14, 1980 and closed on November 30, 1980, after 333 performances. It was directed and choreographed by Robbins, with the book scenes co-directed by Gerald Freedman; produced by Gladys Nederlander and Tom Abbott and Lee Becker Theodore assisted the choreography reproduction.[35] The original scenic, lighting, and costume designs were used. It starred Ken Marshall as Tony, Josie de Guzman as Maria and Debbie Allen as Anita. Both de Guzman and Allen received Tony Award nominations as Best Featured Actress in a Musical, and the musical was nominated as Best Reproduction (Play or Musical). Allen won the Drama Desk Award as Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical. Other notable cast members in the revival included Brent Barrett as Diesel, Harolyn Blackwell as Francisca, Stephen Bogardus as Mouth Piece and Reed Jones as Big Deal\\r\\nThe Minskoff production subsequently opened the Nervi Festival in Genoa, Italy in July 1981 with Josie de Guzman as Maria and Brent Barrett as Tony.[36]\\r\\nIn 2007, Arthur Laurents stated, \\"I've come up with a way of doing [West Side Story] that will make it absolutely contemporary without changing a word or a note.\\"[37] He directed a pre-Broadway production of West Side Story at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. that ran from December 15, 2008 through January 17, 2009. The Broadway revival began previews at the Palace Theatre on February 23, 2009 and opened on March 19, 2009.[38][39] The production wove Spanish lyrics and dialogue into the English libretto. The translations are by Tony Award winner Lin-Manuel Miranda. Laurents stated, \\"The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity. Every member of both gangs was always a potential killer even then. Now they actually will be. Only Tony and Maria try to live in a different world\\".[40][41][42] In August 2009, some of the lyrics for \\"A Boy Like That\\" (\\"Un Hombre Asi\\") and \\"I Feel Pretty\\" (\\"Me Siento Hermosa\\"), which were previously sung in Spanish in the revival, were changed back to the original English.[43] However, the Spanish lyrics sung by the Sharks in the \\"Tonight\\" (Quintet) remained in Spanish.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe cast featured Matt Cavenaugh as Tony, Josefina Scaglione as Maria and Karen Olivo as Anita.[44] Olivo won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, while Scaglione was nominated for the award for Leading Actress.[45][46] The cast recording won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.[47] In July 2010, the producers reduced the size of the orchestra, replacing five musicians with an off-stage synthesizer.[48] The production closed on January 2, 2011 after 748 performances and 27 previews.[49] The revival sold 1,074,462 tickets on Broadway over the course of nearly two years.[50]\\r\\nA national tour was launched on July 1, 1959. The show played in Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Boston. This tour returned to the Winter Garden Theater in New York on April 27, 1960 and closed on December 10 of that year.\\r\\nThe New York City Center Light Opera Company production played for a four-week limited engagement of 31 performances in 1964. Tony was Don McKay, Maria was Julia Migenes and Anita was played by Luba Lisa. It was staged by Gerald Freedman based on Robbins' original concept, and the choreography was re-mounted by Tom Abbott.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Musical Theater of Lincoln Center and Richard Rodgers production opened at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, in June 1968 and closed in September 1968 after 89 performances. Direction and choreography were reproduced by Lee Theodore, and scenery was by Oliver Smith. Tony was played by Kurt Peterson, with Victoria Mallory as Maria.[51]\\r\\nA 1987 U.S. tour starred Jack Wagner as Tony, with Valarie Pettiford as Anita and was directed by Alan Johnson.[52] A bus and truck (non-Equity) tour was produced in 1998 by City Vision Theatricals.[citation needed] A national tour, directed by Alan Johnson, was produced in 2002.[53]\\r\\nA national tour of the 2009 Broadway revival began in October 2010 at the Fisher Theatre in Detroit, Michigan.[54] The cast features Kyle Harris as Tony, Ali Ewoldt as Maria and Eric Hoffmann as Officer Krupke.[55] After a very successful year, the tour was sent out for another year.[56][57] A Non-equity tour version of the 2009 Revival, presented by Troika Entertainment, began in fall 2012.[58]\\r\\nThe musical has also been adapted to be performed as Deaf Side Story using both English and American Sign Language, with deaf Sharks and hearing Jets.[59]\\r\\nThe original Australian production opened in October 1960 at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne, before touring to the Tivoli Theatre in Sydney in February 1961. Subsequent Australian national tours have been staged in 1983, 1994 and 2010.[60]\\r\\nIn 1961, a tour of Israel, Africa and the Near East was mounted. In February 1962, the West End (H. M. Tennent) production launched a five-month Scandinavian tour opening in Copenhagen, continuing to Oslo, Gothenburg, Stockholm and Helsinki. Robert Jeffrey took over from David Holliday as Tony and Jill Martin played Maria. In 1977, Amor Sin Barreras was produced in Mexico City by Alfonso Rosas Prigo, & Ruben Boido, Direction by Ruben Boido, presented at the Hidalgo Theater. Gualberto Castro played the part of Tony; Maria Medina was Maria, among other cast members was Macaria. From 1982ÿ1984 a tour of South America, Israel and Europe was mounted with talent from New York. The Director/Choreographers for that production were Jay Norman and Lee Theodore, veterans of the original Broadway cast. The Japanese Takarazuka Revue has performed the show twice. It was produced by the Moon Troupe in 1998 and again in 1999 by the Star Troupe. A Hong Kong production was produced in 2000 with Cantonese lyrics, featuring Hong Kong rock star Paul Wong as Tony. It was staged at the outdoor plaza of Hong Kong Cultural Centre. Canada's Stratford Shakespeare Festival performed West Side Story in 1999, starring Tyley Ross as Tony and Ma-Anne Dionisio as Maria, and again in 2009,[61]\\r\\nThe Austrian Bregenz Festival presented West Side Story in a German translation by Marcel Prawy in 2003 and 2004, directed by the Francesca Zambello, followed by a German tour.[62] A French language adaptation, translated by Philippe Gobeille, opened in Montreal, Quebec in March 2008.[63] A Philippine version played in 2008 at the Meralco Theatre. It featured Christian Bautista as Tony, Karylle and Joanna Ampil as Maria.[64] Also in 2008, an adaptation played in Portugal, directed by Filipe La Fria, with the name West Side Story ÿ Amor Sem Barreiras, in the Politeama Theater, in Lisbon, with Ricardo Soler as Tony and L~cia Moniz and Anabela splitting the role of Anita.[citation needed]\\r\\nAn international tour (2005ÿ2010), directed and choreographed by Joey McKneely played in Tokyo, Paris, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Singapore, S?o Paulo, France, Taiwan, China, Italy, Rotterdam and Madrid.[65][66] In 2011, a Lima production was produced by \\"Preludio Asociaci܇n Cultural\\" with Marco Zunino as Tony, Rossana Fernndez-Maldonado as Maria, Jes~s Neyra as Bernardo, Tati Alcntara as Anita and Joaqun de Orbegoso as Riff.[67]\\r\\nThe creators' innovations in dance, music and theatrical style resulted in strong reactions from the critics. Walter Kerr wrote in the New York Herald Tribune on September 27, 1957:[68]\\r\\nThe radioactive fallout from West Side Story must still be descending on Broadway this morning. Director, choreographer, and idea-man Jerome Robbins has put together, and then blasted apart, the most savage, restless, electrifying dance patterns we've been exposed to in a dozen seasons .... the show rides with a catastrophic roar over the spider-web fire-escapes, the shadowed trestles, and the plain dirt battlegrounds of a big city feud ... there is fresh excitement in the next debacle, and the next. When a gang leader advises his cohorts to play it \\"Cool\\", the intolerable tension between an effort at control and the instinctive drives of these potential killers is stingingly graphic. When the knives come out, and bodies begin to fly wildly through space under buttermilk clouds, the sheer visual excitement is breathtaking .... Mr. Bernstein has permitted himself a few moments of graceful, lingering melody: in a yearning \\"Maria\\", in the hushed falling line of \\"Tonight\\", in the wistful declaration of \\"I Have a Love\\". But for the most part he has served the needs of the onstage threshing machine ... When hero Larry Kert is stomping out the visionary insistence of \\"Something's Coming\\" both music and tumultuous story are given their due. Otherwise it's the danced narrative that takes urgent precedence ...\\r\\nThe other reviews generally joined in speculation about how the new work would influence the course of musical theater. Typical was John Chapman's review in the New York Daily News on September 27, 1957, headed: \\"West Side Story a Splendid and Super-Modern Musical Drama\\".\\r\\nThe American theatre took a venturesome forward step when the firm of Griffith & Prince presented West Side Story at the Winter Garden last evening. This is a bold new kind of musical theatre ÿ a juke-box Manhattan opera. It is, to me, extraordinarily exciting .... the manner of telling the story is a provocative and artful blend of music, dance and plot ÿ and the music and the dancing are superb. In [the score], there is the drive, the bounce, the restlessness and the sweetness of our town. It takes up the American musical idiom where it was left when George Gershwin died. It is fascinatingly tricky and melodically beguiling, and it marks the progression of an admirable composer ...\\r\\nTime magazine found the dance and gang warfare more compelling than the love story and noted that the show's \\"putting choreography foremost, may prove a milestone in musical-drama history ...\\"[69][70]\\r\\nWhile critics speculated about the comic-tragic darkness of the musical, audiences were captivated. The story appealed to society's undercurrent of rebellion from authority that surfaced in 1950s films like Rebel Without a Cause. West Side Story took this one step further by combining the classic and the hip. Robbins' energetic choreography and Bernstein's grand score accentuated the satiric, hard-edged lyrics of Sondheim, and Laurents' capture of the angry voice of urban youth. The play was criticized for glamorizing gangs, and its portrayal of Puerto Ricans and lack of authentic Latin casting were weaknesses. Yet, the song \\"America\\" shows the triumph of the spirit over the obstacles often faced by immigrants. The musical also made points in its description of troubled youth and the devastating effects of poverty and racism. Juvenile delinquency is seen as an ailment of society: \\"No one wants a fella with a social disease!\\" One writer summed up the reasons for the show's popularity in these terms: \\"On the cusp of the 1960s, American society, still recovering from the enormous upheaval of World War II, was seeking stability and control.\\"\\r\\nThe score for West Side Story was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein, who then wrote revisions on their manuscript (the original, heavily annotated by Ramin, Kostal and Bernstein himself is in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library at Columbia University).[71] Ramin, Kostal, and Bernstein are billed as orchestrators for the show. The orchestra consisted of 31 players: a large Broadway pit orchestra enhanced to include 5 percussionists, a guitarist and a piano/celesta player.[72]\\r\\nIn 1961, Bernstein prepared a suite of orchestral music from the show, titled Symphonic Dances from West Side Story:\\r\\nRecordings of West Side Story include the following:\\r\\nOn October 18, 1961, a film adaptation of the musical was released. It received praise from critics and the public, and became the second highest-grossing film of the year in the United States. The film won ten Academy Awards in its eleven nominated categories, including Best Picture and a special award for Robbins. The film holds the distinction of being the musical film with the most Academy Award wins (10 wins), including Best Picture. Rita Moreno (Anita) was the first Latino actress ever to win an Oscar.[77] The soundtrack album won a Grammy Award and was ranked No. 1 on the Billboard chart for a record 54 weeks.[78]\\r\\nDifferences in the film adaptation from the stage version include that \\"Tonight\\" is moved to follow \\"America\\"; Bernardo sings a line in \\"America\\" instead of Rosalia, with changes in the lyrics. Diesel is renamed Ice. \\"Gee, Officer Krupke\\" is moved before \\"Cool\\" and is sung by Riff instead of Action, and \\"Cool\\" is sung by Ice instead of Riff. After Riff is killed, Ice takes control of the Jets, rather than Action.[79]\\r\\nIn addition to Bernstein's own West Side Story Suite, the music from the musical has been adapted by The Buddy Rich Big Band, which arranged and recorded \\"West Side Story Medley\\" on the 1966 album Buddy Rich's Swingin' New Big Band.[citation needed] The Stan Kenton Orchestra recorded Johnny Richards' 1961 Kenton's West Side Story, an album of jazz orchestrations based on the Bernstein scores.

It claimed Raghuvanshi ancestry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chand kingdom was established by Som Chand, who came here from Kannauj near Allahabad, sometime in the 10th century,[1] and displaced the Katyuri Kings (??????? ????), originally from Katyur valley near Joshimath, who had been ruling the area from the 7th century AD. He continued to call his state Kurmanchal, and established its capital in Champawat in Kali Kumaon, called so, due to its vicinity to river Kali. Many temples built in this former capital city, during the 11th and 12th century exist today, this include the Baleshwar and Nagnath temples.\\r\\nIn 1563, the Chand kings took control of the region, by overpowering small local chiefs and the descendants of Katyuri Kings.\\r\\nThey had brief stints with the Rajput clans in Gangoli and Bankot; then predominant there the Mankotis of Mankot, the Pathanis of Athigaon-Kamsyar, Kalakotis and few Khas Rajput Clans of the region. However they were able to establish their domain there.\\r\\nLater their capital was shifted to Almora by Raja Kalyan Chand in 1563, when he laid the foundation of a town name 'Alam Nagar', which was also called, 'Rajapur',[2][3] a name that still used and has been found inscribed on a number of copper plates of the time.[4]\\r\\nMughal historians mention that Chand ruler, Gyan Chand, visited Delhi Sultanate and received the regions of Bhabhar- Terai up to the Ganges as a grant from then Sultan. The lower hills remained under local chieftains; it was Kirti Chand (1488ÿ1503), who first ruled the entire of Nainital district, along with the rest of Kumaon.\\r\\nIn 1581, the Chand King, Rudra Chand (1565ÿ1597), son of Raja Kalyan Chand seized Sira defeating Raika king Hari Malla and attacked the Garhwal Kingdom for the first time, though this attack was repulsed by then king, Dularam Sah,[5] and so were his subsequent attacks. Rudra Chandra was a contemporary of Akbar, and even paid him a visit in Lahore in 1587, as a mark of his obeisance. Akbarnama mentions him as \\"one of the great landlords of India\\", and further talks about his initial hestitation in approaching the court of Akbar, it was only Raja Todar Mal himself, sent his son Kalyan Das to assure him, did his proceed to meet Akbar. Subsequently, the two met and agreed on a concord,[6] and thus Ain-e-Akbari, written during period of Akbar, also mentions the Sarkar of Kumaon, containing 21 Mahals (a geographical unit of the times) and the revenue collected.[7]\\r\\nAfter death of Rudra Chand in 1597, his son, Lakshmi Chand, also continued attacks of Garhwal for many years, though he too was repulsed. He also constructed the Bagnath temple at Bageshwar in 1602.[citation needed]\\r\\nOne of most powerful rulers of the Chand dynasty was Baz Bahadur (1638ÿ78), who met Shahjahan in Delhi, and in 1655 joined forces with him to attack Garhwal, which was under its king, Pirthi Sah, and subsequently captured the Terai region including Dehradun, which was hence separated from the Garhwal kingdom. Baz Bahadur extended his territory east to Karnali river.\\r\\nIn 1672, Baz Bahadur started a poll tax, and its revenue was sent to Delhi as a tribute. Baz Bahadur also built the Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal,[1] after Lord Golu, a general in his army, who died valiantly at war.[8] He also built the Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal.[9]\\r\\nTowards the end of 17th century, Chand Rajas again attacked the Garhwal kingdom, and in 1688 Udyot Chand erected several temples at Almora, including Tripur Sundari, Udyot Chandeshwer and Parbateshwer, to mark his victory over Garhwal and Doti. The Pabateshwar temple was renamed twice, to become the present Nanda Devi temple.[10] Later, Jagat Chand (1708ÿ20), defeated the Raja of Garhwal and pushed him away from Srinagar, and his kingdom was given to a Brahmin.[11] However, a subsequent king of Garhwal, Pradip Shah (1717ÿ72), regained control over Garhwal and retained Doon till 1757, when Rohilla leader Najib-ul-Daula established himself there, though he was ousted soon by Pradip Shah.\\r\\nThe Chand kings also defeated the Rajwars of Askot, though the latter were allowed to hold their land on the payment of a tribute.[12]\\r\\nThe hill station of Binsar, 30?km from Almora was a summer retreat of the Chand kings.[13]\\r\\nIn the coming years, Jagat Chands successor, Debi Chand (1720-6) took part in the wars of Rohillas of Rohilkhand, and was defeated by the British troops.[1]\\r\\nIn 1744, Ali Mohammed Khan, the Rohilla leader, sent a force into the Chand territory and penetrated through Bhimtal in the Nainital district to Almora; the resistance of Chand army, under its ruler, Kalyan Chand, was weak and ineffective, and Almora fell to the Rohillas, who stayed here for seven short months, though they were ultimately driven out, an exit made possible by paying them a sum of three lakh rupees, and hastened by the harsh terrain of the region.\\r\\nThis peace didnt last long as after just three months, unhappy over his lieutenants, Ali Mohammed Khan attacked again, though this time, he was stopped right at the entrance to the hills, at Barakheri, and defeated; and he made no further attempts to conquer the Kumaon kingdom, nor did the Muslim rulers of Delhi, and this remained the first and the last attack by Muslim rulers on the region. Reconciliation subsequently came into effected; troops from the hills, under Dip Chand, fought side by side with the Rohillas at Third Battle of Panipat in 1761.[1]\\r\\nIn 1760, he renamed the old Parbateshwer temple as Dipchandeshwar temple [10]\\r\\nDuring British rule, then divisional commissioner of Kumaon, George William Trail, got the statue of the Nanda Devi, which had been relocated to the Udyot Chandeshwar temple, from the 'Malla Mahal' (Upper Court) of Chand kings, where the present collectorate exists, and in time, the temple started being called the Nanda Devi temple. The 'Talla Mahal' (Lower Court) of Chand rulers now houses the District Hospital.[14]\\r\\nDue to internal strife, in the coming thirty years the kings lost most of the land they had previously ruled in the plains, and retained only the Bhabhar region.\\r\\nIn 1779, a subsequent Garhwal king, Lalit Shah, captured the Kumaon region from a usurper. Lalit Shah made his son Parduman Shah the king of the Kumaon territory, and after a few years, on the death of his brother in Srinagar, Parduman Shah even held the seat of a combined kingdom of Kumaon and Garhwal for a year, before choosing to go back to Srinagar, in the familiar grounds of Garhwal.\\r\\nIn early 1790, the Gurkhas invaded the Kumaon hills and Almora, under their powerful chief Prithvi Narayan; they advanced by crossing River Kali, through Gangoli; and the Chands, under the titular Chand Raja, were driven to the Bhabhar and finally expelled.\\r\\nThe Terai and Kashipur were ceded to the British by the Nawab of Awadh in 1801, along with the rest of Rohilkhand.\\r\\nNepalese rule lasted for[15] twenty-four years. The end came because of their repeated intrusion into British territories in the Terai from 1800 onwards. Lord Moira, the Governor-General of India, decided to attack Almora in December 1814, marking the beginning of the Anglo-Nepalese War.[3] After the war, the old Lal Mandi fort, near Almora (present cantonment), was renamed Fort Moira.[16]\\r\\nHarak Deo Joshi, the minister of the last Chand Raja,[17] took the side of the British, a force of 4500 men marched from Kashipur in February, 1815. Champawat was first taken in March from Pilibhit, through the Kali River. Within two months, a strong British army under Colonel Nichols attacked and captured Almora, on 26 April 1815.[18] A truce was called the same day, and with the ratification of Treaty of Sugauli on 4 March 1816, Kumaon and Garhwal became a part of the British Raj.\\r\\nBadri Datt Pandey, in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas lists the Chand kings as following:[19]\\r\\nThe first capital of Chand rulers, Champawat, in the stronghold popularly known as Kali Kumaon, is now a district headquarters town, and hold many remnants of once powerful Chand reign, including a medieval fort, Baleshwar temple, Nagnath Temple, etc. Other temples of their reign are Golu Devata Temple, at Ghorakhal, near Bhimtal, and Bhimeshwara Mahadev Temple at Bhimtal.","input":"The founder of chand dyanasty in kumaun was?"},{"output":"May 2, 2015","context":"","input":"What time is the floyd mayweather and manny pacquiao fight?"},{"output":"at least 136 tiles, most commonly 144, although sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will have more usually in the form of flowers or jokers","context":"Mahjong tiles (Chinese: ^?B? or ^??; pinyin: mjingpi; Japanese: ^??; rmaji: mjampai) are tiles of Chinese origin that are used to play mahjong as well as mahjong solitaire and other games. Although they are most commonly tiles, they may also refer to playing cards with similar contents as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest surviving mahjong sets date to the 1870s when the game was largely confined to Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Jiangsu.[1] They already exhibited various traits found in modern sets. The core of the set is the 108 suited tiles which were inherited from Chinese money-suited playing cards. The Wind honor tiles and the Four Seasons tiles were also found in the earliest sets. The honor tiles known as Arrows (Dragons in English) developed to their current form by 1890 concurrent with a new style of play called Zhngf (׷).[2] Flower tiles, once known as Outer Flowers (Chinese: X; pinyin: wihu), were not universally accepted until the 1920s. In contrast, many early sets contained wild cards with specific powers known as Inner Flowers (; lhu) which disappeared from most of China but are still found in Vietnam and Thailand.[3][4]\\r\\nA set of Mahjong tiles will usually differ from place to place. It usually has at least 136 tiles, most commonly 144, although sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will have more usually in the form of flowers or jokers. Some sets also contain blank tiles which owners can use to replace damaged or missing tiles.\\r\\nMahjong tiles can be organized into several categories:\\r\\nSuited tiles (t?Ҹ?; xshpi; \\"ordinal number tiles\\") have a suit and a rank. There are three money-based suits with ranks ranging from one to nine. There are four tiles of each rank and suit combination, thus there are 36 tiles in a suit, and 108 suited tiles in total. To refer to a suited tile, the rank is named, followed by the suit. The ones and nines of each suit (w; yo jiѸ) are collectively referred to as the terminal tiles. The objective of the game is to form melds with them.\\r\\nThe circle suit (Chinese: [b; pinyin: tngzi; \\"barrel\\"; also Chinese: ?; pinyin: bng; Japanese: ?b; rmaji: pinzu; \\"flatbread\\") is represented by a series of circles.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1 Circle is generally a large circle of multiple colors, while the rest of the circle tiles consist of smaller circles, each circle being of one color. The 2 Circle consists of a green and a blue circle, the 3 consisting of one green, one red, and one blue circle arranged diagonally (the order the circles appear in, as well as the orientation, differs between sets). The 4 Circle has two blue circles and two green circles, arranged in a rectangle with circles of like color in opposite corners. The 5 Circle is similar to the 4 Circle, with another circle (its color depending on the set) in the middle. The 6 Circle consists of two green circles at the top and four red circles in the bottom (with a space between the green and red circles). The 7 Circle is similar to the 6 Circle, but has 3 green circles arranged diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. The 8 Circle has eight blue circles arranged in a 2x4 rectangle. The 9 Circle has three each of green, red, and blue circles, with each color occupying a row. There is some space between each row, and the middle row is always of the red circles (the blue and green, of course, depends on the orientation of the tile).\\r\\nBecause of the large size of the circle in the 1 Circle, it is commonly nicknamed da bing (? pinyin dbng, literally: \\"big pancake\\").\\r\\nFrom the monetary origin of this suit, the circles represent the copper coins known in English as \\"cash\\". (1=one copper coin).\\r\\nThe bamboo suit (sb, pinyin suzi (woven thread); also ?l/, pinyin tio (strip); Japanese romaji szu), with the exception of the 1 Bamboo, which is commonly represented by a bird, is represented by outlines of sticks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 Bamboo are represented entirely out of blue and green sticks, while the middle stick in the 5 Bamboo, the top stick of the 7 Bamboo, and the sticks along the center column of the 9 Bamboo are red. Some sets may also have the sticks along the bottom row or center column of the 7 Bamboo in blue. The 8 Bamboo has its sticks forming an M-shape and its mirror image.\\r\\nFrom the monetary origin of this suit, the sticks are actually rope strings (s) that tie 100 Chinese copper coins together by the square holes in the middle. (1s=100) The repeated bumps in the sticks depict the individual coins in the strings, but they were mistaken[by whom?] as the knots on the bamboo plants, hence the English name of the suit. The 1 Bamboo, as it commonly depicts a bird, is often referred as the sparrow (^?? - m qu). In early sets, there was no bird but a single bent string of cash capped with a red knot.[1]\\r\\nThe character suit (?fb/b, pinyin wnzi (myriad), Japanese romaji wanzu or manzu) is represented by Chinese characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some sets use Simplified Chinese characters, many use traditional Chinese characters as they are more complex and considered[by whom?] more aesthetically pleasing. The rank of the tile is represented at the top, in blue, with Chinese numerals, while the character below (?f wn, meaning myriad) is in red. Older sets used the simplified character  when tiles were still hand-carved. Some sets use the character  for five instead of .\\r\\nFrom the monetary origin of this suit, the myriads (10,000) are actually 100 strings of coins described in the bamboo suit section above. One myriad equals ten thousand coins or 100 strings of 100 coins. (1?f=100sG100)\\r\\nRed tiles (p, Japanese akapai) are unique to the Japanese set. They appear as a red version of tiles from each suit and are not quadruplicated. They first appeared in the 1970s with the Red 5 Circle which were followed with red 5 tiles for the other suits.[5] Red 3s and 7s later appeared and were followed by red 1s and 9s although they are much less commonly found in sets than red 5s.[6] There is also a rare red white dragon (, shiro pocchi) which can act as a joker if tsumo conditions are met.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese tiles are entirely optional. When inserted into play, one copy of its regular non-red counterpart is removed. They increase the score when melded. Japanese sets typically do not include the Four Gentlemen flower tiles to make room for the red tiles as flower tiles are rarely used in Japanese Mahjong anyway. Some mahjong parlours will have their own house tiles which may be red tiles for even ranks, even higher-scoring green or gold tiles, or colored wind tiles.\\r\\nHonor tiles (p, pinyin zpi, lit. word tiles) have neither rank nor suit but like suited tiles they are also formed into melds. They are divided into two categories: four Wind tiles (ap/p, pinyin fngpi, Japanese romaji fompai or kazehai) and three Dragon tiles (??p, pinyin snyunpi, Japanese romaji sangempai), each of which is quadruplicated. Thus, there are 16 wind tiles and 12 Dragon tiles for 28 honor tiles.\\r\\nThe four types of Wind tiles are: East (?|, dng, Japanese romaji ton), South (q, nn, Japanese romaji nan), West (l, xؐ, Japanese romaji sh), and North (, bi, Japanese romaji pei or p).\\r\\n\\r\\nEach type of Wind tiles corresponds to a point along the compass, written in blue traditional Chinese characters (even for sets where the Character tiles are written in simplified Chinese). Bonus points are scored if melds match the seat wind or prevailing wind or both. They are also known as the Four Happiness Tiles (p, sxpi).\\r\\nThe three types of Dragon tiles are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chinese name for the Dragon tiles means \\"three elemental tiles\\" (??p). They are also known as the arrow tiles (p).\\r\\nFlower tiles (p pinyin hupi, Japanese hanahai or fapai) are not used in melds. When drawn, they are set aside and the player gets to draw again but from the dead wall. Winners can double their score if the number on their flowers matches their seat number. There are also bonuses from collecting an entire quartet and in some variations, immediately winning from collecting all flowers. As they reward points for pure luck, many games do not include them or are considered optional. In American Mahjong, flowers are treated as honor tiles but from the 1930s to 1960 they were considered jokers.[8][9] Some Japanese players treat flowers as higher scoring honors that cannot be used to form pairs.\\r\\nThe earliest known sets contained twelve flowers but no Four Gentlemen tiles and the Four Seasons were unadorned. Sets with large numbers of flowers were once popular in Northern China to play the game of \\"Flower Mahjong\\" (^??). They typically had 20 or more flowers with some described as having up to 44.[3]\\r\\nFlowers are grouped into quartets with each containing four unique tiles, which are numbered from 1 to 4 or otherwise distinctly labelled. Each number matches a seat (1=East, 2=South, 3=West, 4=North). These tiles usually depict stylized representations of flowers in many colors (hence the name). Nevertheless, other non-floral themes also exist, which vary from set to set. The average set, if it contains flower tiles, will have two quartets of flower tiles, differentiating the color and/or style of the labels. Common Chinese sets will have one quartet with blue Arabic numerals and the other group having red Chinese numerals, numbered one to four.\\r\\nIn mahjong solitaire, the two groups are often called Flower tiles (not to be confused with the blanket term for all groups of flower tiles) and Season Tiles (p j pi, Japanese ?p kisetsuhai).\\r\\nThe four tiles in the Four Seasons (, sj) quartet are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four tiles in the Four Gentlemen (b, sjnzi) quartet are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian mahjong sets contain two more quartets of flower tiles in addition to the Four Seasons and Four Gentlemen.[10][11] These are the usual subjects:\\r\\nWhile some Vietnamese sets use the Four Arts or the Four Noble Professions, most of them use emperors (, Hong) and empresses (Y, H?u). They are not decorated with pictures but just the number and character (e.g. Third Emperor ??, Fourth Empress Y).\\r\\nAnimal tiles (ە[p, pinyin dngwpi) are unnumbered flowers that automatically match the player's seat. These tiles are found in pairs with their subjects usually based on popular Chinese fables. Immediate payment occurs if both tiles in a pair or all the animals are collected. Singaporean sets contain two pairs of animal tiles while Thai and four-player Malaysian sets have four pairs. Some examples of tile pairs include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThree-player Malaysian sets have two pairs of animals accompanied with a quartet of identical animal tiles decorated with a face.\\r\\nJoker tiles (Мp pinyin bҊid, 'a hundred uses' or ?[ tؐngyng, 'many uses' or  fi, 'to fly') can be used to replace any suited or honor tile in putting together a hand subject to local restrictions. Four Jokers are sometimes used in certain variants of Southeast Asian and Chinese mahjong, including Shanghainese mahjong. American mahjong uses eight jokers.\\r\\nVietnamese and Thai mahjong are related to extinct Chinese variants which used specialized jokers such as \\"King Mahjong\\" (t^??).[3] Vietnamese mahjong sets commonly contain eight unique jokers:\\r\\nThe first four jokers have a long lineage. They are found in the earliest sets and were inspired by the suit-restricted jokers in older Chinese card games. Modern Vietnamese sets triplicate or quadruplicate all eight jokers but each copy will have a different frame (rectangle, circle, lozenge, and hexagon) which allows them to be melded with each other.\\r\\nVietnamese style sets made in Hong Kong may also contain two other unique jokers, either as alternatives to the flower joker, or in addition to the usual eight, taking the total number of jokers up to ten.\\r\\nSome modern Vietnamese style sets may have suit, dragon, wind and 258 jokers adorned with multiple characters representing the tiles they can replace, instead of a single Chinese character.\\r\\nTraditionally, Mahjong tiles were made of bone, often backed with bamboo. Bone tiles are still available but most modern sets are constructed from various plastics such as bakelite, celluloid, and more recently nylon. There are a small number of sets that have been made with ivory or jade, but these are exceedingly rare: most sets sold as ivory are in fact made from bone. Regardless of the material used to construct the tiles, the symbols on them are almost always engraved or pressed into the material. Some expert players can determine the face value of their tiles without actually looking at them by feeling these engravings with their fingers.\\r\\nThere are generally two size categories available, the larger mainland-China size and the smaller Taiwanese/Japanese/American size. However, within the former category (Mainland Chinese), 4 sizes have been roughly standardized:\\r\\nThe length/thickness ratio in all of these must be above 1: 1.5, so that the tiles can steadily stand upright, since Chinese players use no racks to support their tiles in hand during play.\\r\\nThe sizes within the second category (Taiwanese/Japanese/American tiles) have lengths that vary roughly between 3?cm (1-5/32\\") and 2.5?cm (1\\"). However, the Japanese tiles set themselves apart within this class by virtue of their thickness, which allows them to stand uprightdespite their diminutive overall size. This enables Japanese mahjong players also to dispense with the use of racks (these are pervasive in the American game, in combination with slimmer tiles.)\\r\\nMahjong tiles were added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.\\r\\nThe Unicode block for mahjong tiles is U+1F000ÿU+1F02B:","input":"How many tiles in a mah jongg set?"},{"output":"in the campus-town of Pantnagar in the district of Udham Singh Nagar in the state of Uttarakhand","context":"G. B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology (GBPUA&T), also known as Pantnagar University, is the first agricultural university of India. It was inaugurated by Jawaharlal Nehru on 17 November 1960 as the \\"Uttar Pradesh Agricultural University\\" (UPAU). Later the name was changed to \\"Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology\\" in 1972 in memory of the first Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, statesman and Bharat Ratna recipient Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. The University was declared as the best among all the other State Universities in India, in 1997. The University lies in the campus-town of Pantnagar in the district of Udham Singh Nagar in the state of Uttarakhand. The university is regarded as the harbinger of Green Revolution in India.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Education Commission of India (1949) headed by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan recommended setting up rural universities in India on American land-grant model.[3] Uttar Pradesh (UP), under chief-ministership of Govind Ballabh Pant, took the first step and in 1954 invited an Indo- American team headed by Dr. K. R. Damle, the Vice-President of ICAR, to consider an area around Tarai State farm in erstwhile Nainital district as a possible site for a rural university.[4] This area was actually a dense forest near Himalayan foothills and the government was using this area to rehabilitate Hindu, Sikh and other migrants from West Pakistan, in the aftermath of the partition of 1947.[5][6] Encouraged by favourable view of the Damle team, two senior government officials- H S Sandhu and A N Jha visited United States to look for collaborations with US Universities. In consultation with University of Illinois dean Dr H W Hannah, the government of state of Uttar Pradesh presented a proposal to the Government of India in 1956 for establishing a Land-grant style university. Thereafter, a contract between the Government of India, the Technical Cooperation Mission and few US land grant universities, was signed to promote agricultural education in India.[7] The US universities included the University of Tennessee, the Ohio State University, the Kansas State University, the University of Illinois, the Pennsylvania State University and the University of Missouri. The task of mentoring the proposed university in UP was assigned to the University of Illinois which signed a contract in 1959.\\r\\nThe University was dedicated to the Nation by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru, on 17 November 1960. In the early Days, Illinois faculty served the university in designing its education system and putting in place an effective research and extension system. Six to eight Illinois faculty used to stay in Pantnagar at a time serving between 2 and 4-year terms for a period of 12 years. Dr. William Thompson, a team member on site at Pantnagar, shared that it was unusual for the project to start a university in a place with nothing. All buildings and facilities had to be constructed in the jungle there. In 1965, drastic upheaval of the university board of directors, which was spurred by lack of state government support for the institution, caused removal of the entire administrative and governance team of the university. D P Singh was named vice chancellor of the university with complete control over its affairs until a new board of directors was chosen. Under Singh's leadership, many necessary upgrades took place, and the university flourished.[8] The University of Illinois left Pantnagar in 1972, when president Richard Nixon ordered Americans out of the near east.[9]\\r\\nThe UP Act XI-V of 1958ÿ the founding legislative act was later amended under UP Universities Re-enactment and Amendment Act 1972 and the University was rechristened as Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology keeping in view the contributions of Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. Pantnagar is a symbol of successful partnership between India and the United States. US greatly influenced the development of the university through its funding of several university programs. Many of the university's research activities were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Indo-U.S. Technical Cooperation Programme, and the United States Agency for International Development (program Public Law 480). The establishment of this university brought about a revolution in agricultural education, research and extension. It paved the way for setting up of 41 other state agricultural universities in the country.[10]\\r\\nPantnagar University soon became a significant force in the development and transfer of High Yielding Variety seeds and related technology.[11] The Mexican wheat varieties, developed by Norman Borlaug were tested in Pantnagar[12][13] and locally adaptable selections, like Pantnagar Kalyan Sona[14] and other improved varieties were released for farmers. The university utilised its 16,000 acres (65?km2) of land to launch one of the largest seed production programs at that time, under the brand name Pantnagar Seeds, which became a household name in rural India. The contribution of the university was recognised by Norman Borlaug, who described Pantnagar as \\"Harbinger of Green Revolution\\".[15]\\r\\nThe University campus at Pantnagar is spread in an area of 10,016.29-acre (40.5345?km2)[16] which makes it the second largest university in the world, in terms of contiguous area. Before 2002, the university owned16,000-acre (65?km2),[17] out of which 3,339-acre (13.51?km2) was transferred to State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand (SIDCUL) for developing an Integrated Industrial estate,[18][19] thus leaving 12,661-acre (51.24?km2) with the university. Remaining land was transferred to other industries, railways, airport etc. Moscow State University is built vertically and has a larger total floor area but occupies a smaller piece of land. Berry College occupies 28,000-acre (110?km2) of contiguous land, and Paul Smith's College occupies 14,200-acre (57?km2) of land in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York, but neither is a university. Duke University occupies 8,709-acre (35.24?km2), but they are not contiguous.[20] The United States Air Force Academy has a contiguous 18,000-acre (73?km2) at its disposal, but it is not a university. Dartmouth College, with a large land grant,[21] owns more than 50,000-acre (200?km2),but only 269 acres (109?ha) of those are part of the campus.[22][23]\\r\\nStanford University owns 8,183-acre (33.12?km2), which makes it the third largest university in the world, in terms of contiguous area.[24]Sewanee: The University of the South occupies 13,000-acre (53?km2) in its \\"Domain\\", making it largest contiguous university campus.\\r\\nThe university campus is located at a distance of 250?km from Delhi in Udham Singh Nagar district of Uttarakhand. The nearby towns are Rudrapur (16?km), Haldwani (25?km), Kichha (13?km) and Nainital (65?km). Two National Highways- NH 87 and Bareilly- Nainital highway touch the campus. Pantnagar Airport, operated by Airports Authority of India is located in the campus, 2.5?km west of main administrative building. Two railway stations of North Eastern Railways- Pantnagar (IR Code PBW) and Haldi Road (IR Code HLDD) are located in the campus at a distance of 4?km (east) and 3?km (west) respectively from administrative building. University shuttle service, local rickshaws, auto-rickshaws and matador vans connect various parts of the campus. Pantnagar is a purely residential university and comprises an independent township in itself.[25] Population of Pantnagar, prior to establishment of Industrial estate was 35,820 (Census, 2001). Pantnagar is a part of Pantnagar- Kichha assembly constituency.[26] The 'Concentric semicircles' or the 'rising sun' plan of the campus-centre was a brainchild of Department of Architecture of Illinois University.[27][28]\\r\\nIn the Indian higher education system, Pantnagar is classified as a State Agricultural University (SAU).[29] The university is in the jurisdiction of the state government. The Governor of the state is ex-officio Chancellor of the university and (s)he appoints a Vice-chancellor (VC), who functions as a full-time Chief executive of the university. The VC chairs a 13-membered Board of Management, which is the highest executive body of the university and oversees primarily financial and administrative matters and also ratifies recommendations of other councils of the university.\\r\\nThe other councils are the Academic council, the Research council and the Extension education council.[33] Governor of Uttarakhand Dr. Krishan Kant Paul is the present Chancellor and Prof. Aditya Kumar Misra is VC of the university.\\r\\nThe university is financed primarily from grant-in-aid of the state government and through grants received from the central government through Indian Council of Agricultural Research, besides income from student tuition fees, sponsored research, university farm, etc. Total allocated budget for the university in the year 2011ÿ2012 stood at Rs 240 crores (~ US$50 million), which puts Pantnagar among top five SAUs in terms of financial resources.[32]\\r\\nRecently, a high powered central government committee ÿ the Committee to Advise on Renovation and Rejuvenation of Higher Education (Yashpal Committee, 2009)  has recommended converting agricultural universities into general universities encompassing all branches of studies.[34][35] There is also a popular demand to convert Pantnagar University into a Central University.[36][unreliable source?]\\r\\nPantnagar is a non-affiliating university and its academic activities are organized through its nine constituent colleges (faculties),which run large undergraduate (UG) programs. All Masters and PhD students are part of College of Post Graduate Studies, however they have strong association with one of the other colleges as per their academic major. Prior to 2012, the university also had two off-campus colleges namely, 'College of Forestry and Hill Agriculture, Ranichauri' (founded 1991) and 'Veer Chandra Singh Garhwali College of Horticulture, Bharsar' (founded 2002). However, recently, through an act of Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly[37] these colleges have been transferred to newly incorporated Uttarakhand University of Horticulture and Forestry. Distributed among colleges and other units of the university, there are 763 teachers and officers, 59 technical personnel, 631 administrative personnel and 1425 class III employees, amounting to a total staff strength of 2878 against a students strength of 2800ÿ3000, which makes teacher taught ratio of about 1:6 and student-staff ratio about 1:1.[38]\\r\\n? Counted in associated College\\r\\n** Participating faculty from various departments\\r\\nThe university shifted from a trimester to a semester system in the 1980s to reduce the workload on students.[41] There are 200ÿ210 net instructional days per year, which is highest in India.[42] The minimum duration of all UG programs of the university is 8 semesters (4 years), except BVSc&AH (10 semesters, 5-year). All the UG programs are infused with extensive practical training and include one semester of compulsory internship/ work experience. All Masters programs are of 4 semester (2 years), except MCA (6 semester/ 3 years). Normal duration for PhD is 6 semesters. The university follows a credit based GPA system for evaluation. In 1998, it shifted from the US style 5-point and letter grade system to a 10-point GPA based system, for easy conversion to percentages, which are more commonly used in India.\\r\\nwhere:\\r\\nThe university follows 100% internal evaluation on continuous basis. A course has typically 2 pre-final exams (popularly called as \\"hourlies\\"), 1 lab final exam and 1 semester-end final exam, totalling 4 evaluation cycles per semester. Typically, a UG student registers for 8 courses in a semester, leading to 8*4= 32 exams i.e. on an average basis, 1 exam on every fourth working day. Since its inception, Pantnagar University is known for its academic rigour for keeping its students always busy.[43]\\r\\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings for BRICS 2015, a ranking of the top universities in the five BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), has placed the university amongst the top 150[44] universities.\\r\\nBeing an Agriculture and Technology university, the main focus of research is on agriculture and engineering. Research is coordinated by a Directorate of Experiment Station and carried out through ~70 subject-matter departments spread across colleges, 14 specialised research centres located in the campus, 7 dedicated off-campus research stations and 10 off-campus horticultural research-cum-extension centres. So far, the university has released 211 varieties, many of which played important role in Green Revolution.[11] The work of the university in introducing soybean as a crop in India is well known.[45][46] As Uttarakhand has been declared an 'Organic state', the present thrust of research is on Organic farming and Biological pest control. The university has developed a pregnancy diagnostic kit for cattle and its Salmonellosis vaccine for poultry is in advanced trials. In 1991, engineers of the university developed a 'Zero-till Ferti seed drill' for No-till farming along with National Agro Industries Ludhiana Punjab, which has been immensely popular in Haryana, Punjab and other areas of Indo-gangetic plains. CIMMYT/CGIAR has described zero tillage technology based on the Pantnagar seed drill as the most widely adopted resource conserving technology in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, till date.[47]\\r\\nExtension is one of the three mandates of the university. University organises informal continuing education programs for rural people for achieving better diffusion of innovation. The university reaches out to a wider clientele through short term training programs at its campuses, Farmer Field Schools, Participatory technology development programs, radio and television broadcast, community radio based narrowcasting, print media, Farmer's fairs, and other innovative communication technologies. The university maintains a State Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute and a network of 11 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (Farm Science Centres,KVKs) located in various districts.\\r\\nPantnagar is a residential university. Hostel accommodation is compulsory, except for the wards of university employees who live in the campus. In the Pantnagar campus, there are 23 hostels (called bhawans), including seven for girls, two for married couples and one for working women. The older hostels are named after important personalities of India: Mohandas K. Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Govind Ballabh Pant, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, Kasturba Gandhi, Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya, Chittaranjan Das (I and II) and Vivekananda with the exception of a hostel named Silver Jublee, which commemorates 25 years of the university.\\r\\nThe names of newly constructed bhawans are inspired from the various geographical regions of the Uttarakhand  Gangotri, Yamunotri, Shivalik, Mandakini, Bhagirathi, Alaknanda etc.  with an exception of a new hostel named 'Golden Jublee', commemorating 50 years. Most of older hostels are along the 'third arc' as per the original 'concentric semicircles' campus plan, while newer ones are on radial roads or other parts of the campus. There are two guest houses, Lambert's Square and International Guest House, which has a hostel wing for foreign students and an attached Farmer's Hostel. The hostels have student-managed or, in few cases, outsourced cafeteria-style food services. All the faculty members and employees stay in bungalows and apartments on campus. Two Market Namely Chhoti (small) and Bari (big) markets are also present in the campus.\\r\\nMost of the students' activities are organised through college-level professional societies, like the Agriculture Society, the Engineering Society, the Management Society, etc. These societies organise popular fests, fairs, cultural nights, treasure hunts and competitions year round. Apart from these, there are departmental societies, hostel societies and other organisations like the Vivekanand Swadhyay Mandal, Sanskritic Chetna Parishad, etc. which organise popular student activities. The Pantnagar Chapter of SPIC MACAY regularly organises classical music and dance concerts by renowned artistes. CHETNA Student Wing is an extension of CHETNA NGO (Delhi) working for upliftment of underprivileged and poor children in the campus and nearby areas.\\r\\nThe university National Cadet Corps (NCC) chapter organises basic military training and adventure sports for student-cadets. The Remount & Veterinary (R&V) core is a Cavalry regiment of NCC, which trains students for professional equestrianism (horse riding). Pantnagar is among very few universities in India to have a full-fledged Air Squadron under NCC Air Wing, which promotes aviation and airmanship among students through its activities organised in the airport near the university campus.\\r\\nAll undergraduate students of Pantnagar take part in community service, which fetches them two credits towards their degrees in form of a mandatory National Service Scheme course involving 240 hours/10 days of social service. Students also take part in liberal education courses offered by the university like dance, music, yoga, Indian cultural heritage, personality development, English vocabulary, Indian languages (Tamil, Punjabi), foreign languages (French, German), etc. Stevenson stadium is the hub of sports activities, which are organised through 17 sport clubs.\\r\\nCoordinates: 2903N 7931E? / ?29.050N 79.517E? / 29.050; 79.517","input":"Where first agriculture university of india was established?"},{"output":"George Washington","context":" \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe President of the United States is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by the people through the Electoral College.\\r\\nSince the office was established in 1789, 44 men have served as president. The first, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms in office, and is counted as the nation's 22nd and 24th presidents; the incumbent, Donald Trump, is therefore the 45th president. There are currently five living former presidents. The most recent death of a former president was on December 26, 2006 with the death of Gerald Ford.\\r\\nWilliam Henry Harrison's presidency was the shortest in American history. He died 31 days after taking office in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[1]\\r\\nOf the elected presidents, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his own presidency, as opposed to a caretaker president. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution put Tyler's precedent into law in 1967. It also established a mechanism by which a mid-term vacancy in the vice presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first president to fill a vacancy under this Provision when he appointed Gerald Ford to the office. Later, Ford became the second to do so when he appointed Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. Previously, a mid-term vacancy was left unfilled.\\r\\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, there were no parties. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, factions began rallying around dominant Washington Administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Greatly concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[2] Since Washington, every president has been affiliated with a political party at the time they assumed office.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThree presidents held another U.S. federal office after serving as president.\\r\\nSeveral presidents campaigned unsuccessfully for other U.S. state or federal elective offices after serving as president.\\r\\nAdditionally, one former president, John Tyler, served in the government of the Confederate States during the American Civil War. Tyler served in the Provisional Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1862. He was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives in November 1861, but died before he could take his seat.","input":"What was the first president of the united states of america?"},{"output":"single-cell microorganism","context":"Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used as a leavening agent in baking bread and bakery products, where it converts the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] which is the same species (but a different strain) commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.\\r\\nThe use of steamed or boiled potatoes,[3] water from potato boiling,[4] or sugar in a bread dough provides food for the growth of yeasts; however, too much sugar will dehydrate them.[5] Yeast growth is inhibited by both salt and sugar, but more so by salt than sugar.[6] Some sources say fats, such as butter and eggs, slow down yeast growth;[7] others say the effect of fat on dough remains unclear, presenting evidence that small amounts of fat are beneficial for baked bread volume.[8]\\r\\nSaccharomyces exiguus (also known as S. minor) is a wild yeast found on plants, fruits, and grains that is occasionally used for baking; however, in general it is not used in a pure form but comes from being propagated in a sourdough starter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not known when yeast was first used to bake bread; the earliest definite records come from Ancient Egypt.[9] Researchers speculate that a mixture of flour meal and water was left longer than usual on a warm day and the yeasts that occur in natural contaminants of the flour caused it to ferment before baking. The resulting bread would have been lighter and tastier than the previous hard flatbreads. It is generally assumed that the earliest forms of leavening were likely very similar to modern sourdough; the leavening action of yeast would have been discovered from its action on flatbread doughs, and would have been either cultivated separately or transferred from batch to batch by means of previously mixed (\\"old\\") dough. Also, the development of leavened bread seems to have developed in close proximity to the development of beer brewing, and barm from the beer fermentation process can also be used in bread making.\\r\\nWithout an understanding of microbiology, early bakers would have had little ability to directly control yeast cultures, but still kept locally interesting cultures by reusing doughs and starters to leaven later batches. However, it became possible to isolate and propagate favored yeast strains in the same manner as was done in the beer industry, and it eventually became practical to propagate yeast in a slurry with a composition similar to beer wort, usually including malted barley and wheat flour. Such cultures (sometimes referred to in old American cookery as \\"emptins\\", from their origins as the dregs of beer or cider fermentation) would become the ancestors of modern baker's yeast, as, in general, they were carefully maintained to avoid what would later be discovered to be bacterial contamination, including using preservatives such as hops as well as boiling the growth medium.\\r\\nIn the 19th century, bread bakers obtained their yeast from beer brewers, and this led to sweet-fermented breads such as the Imperial \\"Kaiser-Semmel\\" roll,[10] which in general lacked the sourness created by the acidification typical of Lactobacillus. However, beer brewers slowly switched from top-fermenting to bottom-fermenting yeast (both S. cerevisiae) and this created a shortage of yeast for making bread, so the Vienna Process was developed in 1846.[11] While the innovation is often popularly credited for using steam in baking ovens, leading to a different crust characteristic, it is notable for including procedures for high milling of grains (see Vienna grits[12]), cracking them incrementally instead of mashing them with one pass; as well as better processes for growing and harvesting top-fermenting yeasts, known as press-yeast.\\r\\nRefinements in microbiology following the work of Louis Pasteur led to more advanced methods of culturing pure strains. In 1879, Great Britain introduced specialized growing vats for the production of S. cerevisiae, and in the United States around the turn of the century centrifuges were used for concentrating the yeast,[13] making modern commercial yeast possible, and turning yeast production into a major industrial endeavor. The slurry yeast made by small bakers and grocery shops became cream yeast, a suspension of live yeast cells in growth medium, and then compressed yeast, the fresh cake yeast that became the standard leaven for bread bakers in much of the Westernized world during the early 20th century.\\r\\nDuring World War II, Fleischmann's developed a granulated active dry yeast for the United States armed forces, which did not require refrigeration and had a longer shelf-life and better temperature tolerance than fresh yeast; it is still the standard yeast for US military recipes. The company created yeast that would rise twice as fast, cutting down on baking time. Lesaffre would later create instant yeast in the 1970s, which has gained considerable use and market share at the expense of both fresh and dry yeast in their various applications.\\r\\nBaker's yeast is available in a number of different forms, the main differences being the moisture contents.[14] Though each version has certain advantages over the others, the choice of which form to use is largely a question of the requirements of the recipe at hand and the training of the cook preparing it. Dry yeast forms are good choices for longer-term storage, often lasting more than a year at room temperatures without significant loss of viability.[15] In general, with occasional allowances for liquid content and temperature, the different forms of commercial yeast are considered interchangeable.\\r\\nFor most commercial uses, yeast of any form is packaged in bulk (blocks or freezer bags for fresh yeast; vacuum-packed brick bags for dry or instant); however, yeast for home use is often packaged in pre-measured doses, either small squares for compressed yeast or sealed packets for dry or instant. For active dry and instant yeast, in general a single dose (reckoned for the average bread recipe of between 500 g and 1000 g of dough) is about 2.5 tsp (~12 mL) or about 7?g (1?4?oz), though comparatively lesser amounts are used when the yeast is used in a pre-ferment. In general, a yeast flavor in the baked bread is not noticeable when the bakers' percent of added yeast is less than 2.5%.[21]\\r\\nBecause it is readily available and easy to culture, baker's yeast has long been used in chemical, biological, and genetic research as a model organism. In 1996, after 6 years of work, S. cerevisiae became the first eukaryote to have its entire genome sequenced. It has over 12 million base pairs and around 6000 genes. Since then, it has remained in the forefront of genetic research. For example, most of our knowledge of the cell division cycle was worked out from experiments with yeast.\\r\\nBaker's yeast contains enzymes that can reduce a carbonyl group into a hydroxyl group in fairly high yield, thus making it useful for biotransformations in organic syntheses.[22] It is known to reduce organometallic carbonyl compounds in very high yield.[23]\\r\\nBaker's yeast can also be used to produce ethanol via fermentation for use in chemical synthesis, although doing so in some places requires permits.\\r\\nThe baking industry relies on industrial production of its ingredients, including baking yeasts. Much effort has been put into developing and marketing yeasts that will perform reliably in mass production. Since the end of the nineteenth century, baker's yeast has been produced by companies that specialize in its production.\\r\\nThe main ingredients for industrial production are yeast cultures, cane and beet; but a number of minerals, nitrogen and vitamins are also needed.[24]\\r\\nFermentation happens in several phases, which vary depending on the manufacturer:[24][25]\\r\\nThe yeast grows from hundreds kg in the intermediate and stock fermentor to tens of thousands kg in the trade fermentor, where most yeast is produced.[24] The earlier stages produce more ethanol and other alcohols, while in the final stages ethanol production is suppressed up to 95?% by controlling the amount of oxygen and sugar, in order to increase the yeast production instead.[24]\\r\\nThe industry is highly concentrated, with 5 companies holding up to 80?% of the worldwide market for dry yeast as of 2006. While dry yeast is exported over long distances and mostly sold in the developing countries, industrial customers often prefer to supply fresh yeast from local facilities, with a single wholesaler having up to 90?% of liquid yeast market in UK in 2006.[26] In USA companies like Lesaffre Group, AB Vista, DSM, GB Plange and AB Mauri, produced hundreds of thousands of metric tons of yeast in 2012.","input":"What type of organism is baker's yeast?"},{"output":"Brian McGuire Cashman","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian McGuire Cashman (born July 3, 1967) is an American baseball executive for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball.

He was named assistant general manager in 1992, helping to run the team while owner George Steinbrenner was suspended from baseball. He succeeded Bob Watson as the team's general manager in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman was born in Rockville Centre, New York, and raised in Washingtonville, New York. He was raised in an Irish Catholic family,[2][3] as the middle of five children born to Nancy and John Cashman.[4] He became a baseball fan at a young age, attending a summer camp hosted by Bucky Dent before starting high school. He grew up as a fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers.[5] While visiting his grandmother in Florida, he served as a batboy for the Dodgers during spring training in 1982, with the help of former Dodger Ralph Branca, a family friend.[3][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cashman family moved to Lexington, Kentucky, where his father managed Castleton Farm, raising standardbreds for harness racing.[3] Cashman described moving out of Washingtonville before starting high school as \\"the best thing to happen to [him], to get out of there.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman attended Lexington Catholic High School before moving to the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. He attended Georgetown Preparatory School in North Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1985. Cashman played baseball and junior varsity basketball at both schools, and added football in his senior year.[8] Brian was classmates with Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic University of America offered Cashman the opportunity to play college baseball for the Catholic Cardinals, competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III, guaranteeing him playing time as a freshman.[4]  He was a four-year starter at second base and the team's leadoff hitter. He set a school record for most hits in a season, which has since been broken. He earned a bachelor's degree with a major in history in 1989.[4][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeorge Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees, met John Cashman when he managed Pompano Park in Pompano Beach, Florida, and the two became friends.[4] Through another family friend, John helped Brian obtain a position with the Yankees organization as an intern in 1986.[10][11] He worked in the minor league scouting department in the day, and worked security at night.[3] After Cashman graduated from Catholic, the Yankees offered him a position as a baseball operations assistant, which he accepted.[4][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSteinbrenner was banned from baseball in July 1990 for hiring a gambler to investigate Dave Winfield. Gene Michael, then the Yankees' General Manager, took over daily operations of the Yankees, and Cashman played a role in assisting him.[4] He was promoted to assistant farm director that year,[10] and to major league administrator in 1991.[12] Michael named Cashman an Assistant General Manager in 1992.[4] He remained in the role after Bob Watson succeeded Michael as general manager in 1995.[13] The Yankees won the 1996 World Series.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1998, Watson resigned from the Yankees, and Cashman was named Senior Vice-President and General Manager.[12] He agreed to a one-year contract for $300,000, and became the second-youngest general manager in MLB history.[4][15][a] The Yankees won 114 games during the 1998 season, and won the 1998 World Series. In 1999, Cashman traded fan favorite David Wells to the Toronto Blue Jays to acquire Roger Clemens. The next year, he acquired David Justice, who won the American League Championship Series (ALCS) Most Valuable Player Award for his play in the 2000 ALCS. The Yankees won the 2000 World Series, making Cashman the first General Manager to win World Series titles in his first three years. In 2004, Cashman arranged the trade of Alfonso Soriano for Alex Rodriguez.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the team's success, Cashman considered leaving the Yankees in 2005 due to conflicts with Steinbrenner and organizational disputes between team officials in New York City and Tampa, Florida.[16] The Washington Nationals were rumored to be interested in hiring Cashman, which would have brought him back to the city where he attended school. Instead, Cashman agreed to a new contract with the Yankees following the conclusion of the 2005 season which gave him more authority in personnel decisions and paid him an average of $1.3 million more over the following three years.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the increased authority, Cashman created a department of professional scouting, and tabbed Billy Eppler as its director.[18] Later, Eppler would move on to become the General Manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[19] On September 30, 2008, Cashman signed a three-year contract to stay with the Yankees through the 2011 season.[20] Following the 2008 season, when the Yankees failed to make the playoffs, Cashman signed CC Sabathia, A. J. Burnett, and Mark Teixeira to long-term free agent contracts and traded for Nick Swisher. These four players played a significant role in the 2009 Yankees season,[21] culminating with a victory in the 2009 World Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Yankees went on to make the playoffs again following the 2010 season, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American League Championship Series. Following the 2010 season, Cashman held a hard line with Derek Jeter during contract negotiations, reportedly telling Jeter that he would prefer to have Troy Tulowitzki as the Yankees' starting shortstop,[22] though a deal was eventually made for three years and $45 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nYankees ownership agreed to sign Rafael Soriano in January 2011 without Cashman's approval. Cashman stated at Soriano's introductory press conference that he disagreed with the deal.[23] The Yankees re-signed Cashman to a three-year contract in November 2011.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 2013, Alex Rodriguez composed a tweet, saying that he had been cleared to play by his doctors after his hip surgery. Cashman was not pleased about the tweet, claiming that the doctors did not give such authority to clear Rodriguez to play after seeking a second opinion with them, causing his faith and relationship with Rodriguez to be alienated.[4][25] Cashman also wanted to trade Robinson Can܇ during the 2013 season, reasoning that they would be unable to re-sign him in the next offseason. Ownership prevented Cashman from exploring a trade.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2013 season, the Yankees signed Masahiro Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann, and Carlos Beltrn to contracts that totaled $438?million. However, the Yankees missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year. On October 10, 2014, the Yankees signed Cashman to another three-year deal through the 2017 season.[27] That offseason, Cashman prioritized restructuring the Yankees roster with younger players. He replaced the retired Jeter with Didi Gregorius and also acquired Nathan Eovaldi,[28] both of whom improved during the season.[29] In the 2016 season, he traded Carlos Beltrn to the Texas Rangers, Andrew Miller to the Cleveland Indians, and Aroldis Chapman to the eventual World Series Champion Chicago Cubs to bolster the Yankees farm system.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the Yankees made the postseason with rookie outfielder Aaron Judge and second-year catcher Gary Sanchez. The Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins in the 2017 American League Wild Card Game, and then went on to defeat the Cleveland Indians in the 2017 American League Division Series. Making their first appearance in the American League Championship Series since 2012, the Yankees lost to the Houston Astros in seven games, far outpacing the expectations of many analysts. Following the season, Cashman recommended to owner Hal Steinbrenner that a managerial change was needed. Baseball America named Cashman their Executive of the Year after the season.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 9, Cashman traded second baseman Starlin Castro and two prospects for Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 11, 2017, Cashman signed a 5-year, $25 million contract with the Yankees to keep him as General Manager through 2022.[32] If Cashman completes his new deal, he will become the longest tenured General Manager in Yankees history.\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman was named to Crain's New York Business 40 under 40 list for 1999.[33] The Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America selected Cashman as their MLB Executive of the Year for 2009.[34] In 2010, Cashman was inducted into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman was selected as Baseball Executive of the Year in 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman was also involved in the developing of the video game MLB Front Office Manager.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nCashman lives in Darien, Connecticut.[37] He and his wife, Mary, had two children, Grace and Theodore.[38] Mary filed for divorce in February 2012; they had been reportedly separated for a year.

It is 268?miles 56?chains (432.4?km) down the line from London King's Cross and on the main line it is situated between Chester-le-Street to the south and Manors to the north. Its three-letter station code is NCL.\\r\\nOpened in 1850, it is a Grade I listed building[1] and is located in the city centre at the southern edge of Grainger Town and to the west of the Castle Keep. It is a nationally important transport hub, being both a terminus and through-station on the main line between London and Edinburgh, the Durham Coast Line to Middlesbrough, and the Tyne Valley Line to Carlisle. It is also served by the adjoining Central Station on the Tyne and Wear Metro. As of September 2017[update], the main line station is managed by Virgin Trains East Coast.[2]\\r\\nAll Virgin Trains East Coast services between London and Edinburgh stop at Newcastle. CrossCountry supplements services to Scotland, and operates trains southbound to the South West and South Coast of England via Birmingham and the wider Midlands region; trains reach as far as Penzance and Southampton. The station is also a terminus for TransPennine Express, which connects Newcastle to Liverpool Lime Street, via Leeds and Manchester Victoria, with some services also running to Manchester Airport.\\r\\nNorthern variously combines three routes out of Newcastle in order to provide both terminating and through services. To the west, trains connect the city to the MetroCentre shopping centre, Hexham and Carlisle, with intermittent extensions to Whitehaven, and to the north, Cramlington and Morpeth on the main line, with extensions to Chathill. To the south east, the Durham Coast Line connects to Sunderland and County Durham and Teesside. Important stops include Hartlepool, Stockton and Middlesbrough, the line being shared with Tyne and Wear Metro trains to Sunderland. In peak hours some services arrive from Teesside via the main line. Additionally, Northern and Abellio ScotRail jointly operate a limited service to Glasgow Central via Carlisle.\\r\\nTogether with the Metro stop and numerous local bus routes, the complex is one of the most important transport hubs in the North East. There are currently two Metro and 12 main line platforms seeing 13 million passengers annually, and in light of increasing patronage the main line station has undergone a major refurbishment to increase retail space and enhance the station environment including the pedestrianisation of the portico.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA scheme for a central station was proposed by Richard Grainger and Thomas Sopwith in 1836[5] but was not built.\\r\\nThe Newcastle and Carlisle Railway had agreed to relinquish their insistence on exclusively using their Redheugh terminus on the south bank of the River Tyne. They agreed with George Hudson on a general station north of the Tyne, near the Spital. Instead of crossing the Tyne by a low level bridge and climbing to the Spital by a rope-worked incline, they would build an extension crossing at Scotswood and approaching on the north bank. They opened this line and a temporary station at Forth, and passenger trains started using that on 1 March 1847.[6]\\r\\nHudson, known as the \\"Railway King\\" was concentrating on connecting his portfolio of railways so as to join Edinburgh with the English network. His Newcastle and Berwick Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament in 1845, but for the time being it was to use the Newcastle and North Shields Railway's station at Carliol Square. Building a crossing of the Tyne was obviously going to be a lengthy process, so that he gave the construction of the general station a low priority. The Tyne crossing became the High Level Bridge.[7][8]\\r\\nIn February 1846 the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway exerted pressure for the general station to be built, and the architect John Dobson was appointed by Hudson to design it, in association with the engineer T E Harrison, and Robert Stephenson. By now the general alignment of Hudson's railways was becoming clear: a main line from the south via Gateshead would approach over the High Level Bridge and enter the general station from the east; the Newcastle and Berwick line would be extended from Carliol Square and also enter from the east; through trains from London to Scotland would reverse in the new station. Newcastle and Carlisle Railway trains would of course enter from the west.[7][8]\\r\\nDobson produced general plans for the station, now being referred to as the Central station, on a broad curve to front Neville Street so as to accommodate the alignment of the approaching railways at east and west. It was to a \\"Romano-Italien design with ornamental work of the Doric order\\".[9] Two through platform lines were shown, with three west end bays and two at the east end. There were to be three trainshed roofs with spans of 60 feet. Extensive offices as well as refreshment facilities were shown, and there was to be a covered carriage drive on the Neville Street side extending from the porte-cochre at each end.\\r\\nOn 7 August 1847 a contract was let for the main part of the work to Mackay and Blackstock, for S92,000 (equivalent to S7,580,000 in 2015).[10] A considerable amount of groundworks was necessary on the large site prior to the actual building work.[7]\\r\\nThe work did not progress speedily, and in 1849 Hudson's collection of railway companies suffered a financial shock. At a time of more difficult trading and a tighter money market, Hudson's personal dealings were exposed as shady. The York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway]] had been formed by merger of the previous smaller companies, and the YN&BR wished to reduce the financial commitment to the Central Station substantially; hotel accommodation and the covered carriage drive were eliminated. One of the through platforms was also removed from the plan.[7]\\r\\nAs built the site covered three acres and the length of the platform faces was 830 yards.[9]\\r\\nThe trainshed proved faster to construct and on 29 August 1850 Queen Victoria visited the station by train and formally opened it. The following day YN&BR trains were diverted into it.[note 1] The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway transferred its terminal facilities into the new station on 1 January 1851. At this period it was customary to have separate \\"arrival\\" and \\"departure\\" platforms for terminating trains. The Newcastle and Carlisle Railway used right-hand running, so that conveniently their west-facing departure platform was located against the station buildings, enabling booking and waiting rooms to be located directly adjacent to the departing trains.\\r\\nThe trainshed was, jointly with the Lime Street station in Liverpool, the first to be designed and built in Britain using curved wrought iron ribs to support an arched roof. The large section of the ribs was fabricated using curved web plates specially rolled using bevelled rolls; the novel technique was created by Thomas Charlton of Hawks Crawshay, and was estimated to have saved 14% on the cost of the roof ironwork, compared with cutting rectilinear plates to the curve.[7]\\r\\nThe station was lit by gas; a demonstration of electric arc-lighting was made, but was not at that date a practical possibility for the large station space. The platforms were positioned 15 inches above rail level.\\r\\nIn 1861 the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway had already merged with others to form the North Eastern Railway, and now it was desired to amalgamate with the Newcastle and Berwick Railway too. The Corporation of Newcastle used the opportunity of the necessary Parliamentary Bill for the amalgamation to insist on construction of the abandoned porte-cochre, and this was designed by Thomas Prosser and completed in 1863.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1860s the passenger train service was increasing considerably, especially as branch lines opened, and an additional through island platform was provided in 1871, occupying space formerly in use for stabling carriages. Increase in traffic continued, as also increasing train lengths and it was clear that a major extension of the station was essential. Newcastle had been given city status in 1882 and was supportive of the work, seeing it as a civic improvement. Forth Street was displaced southwards and two new trainshed roofs covered a southward extension of the station; in addition a large expansion to the east took place, with additional bay platforms there on the north side of the former bays. The original through track was blocked to form east and west bays, so that there were still only three through platform lines. This work was completed in 1894.[7]\\r\\nThe new group of bay platforms at the east end had their own concourse quadrangle, known at the time as the \\"Tynemouth Square\\". There was a separate booking hall for those local services. At this stage the roof covered seven and a half acres in area; there were fifteen platforms with a length of 3,000 yards.[9]\\r\\nIn 1901 an early steam locomotive was on display at the station;?:\\r\\n[The station] is further graced by a pedestal on which stands a curious old locomotive rejoicing in the name of \\"Billy\\". The true early history of \\"Billy\\" is well-nigh veiled in the mists of antiquity, and it was only by diligent enquiry that Mr Holliday, the Station Master, was able to learn a little of her antecedents. That \\"she\\" was constructed as far back as 1824 ÿ 1826 is however certain, and on that score alone she is entitled to an introduction to such of the readers of the Railway Magazine as have until now been unaware of her existence. For about fifty-five years (until 1879) she performed good service, first at the Springwell, and latterly at the Killingworth colliery, from which place she actually steamed into Newcastle in 1881 to celebrate George Stephensons Centenary.[9]\\r\\nAn image of the locomotive in Bywell's article is captioned \\"Puffing billy\\" but it is not Puffing Billy of 1814, which is currently on display at the Science Museum in London.\\r\\nThe locomotive in Bywell's article is known simply as Billy (Built in 1826) It was presented to Newcastle upon Tyne Corporation for preservation in 1881. Initially it was displayed on a plinth at the north end of the High Level Bridge, but was moved to the interior of Newcastle Central Station in 1896; it remained there until 1945, when it was moved to the city's Museum of Science and Industry; it was moved again in 1981 to the Stephenson Railway Museum in nearby North Shields, where it is still on display.\\r\\nThe early history of the locomotive is uncertain; it is probably a George Stephenson locomotive, and was probably built at Killingworth Colliery workshops around 1815-1820.[12]\\r\\nIn 1900 the North Eastern Railway started replacing the gas lighting in the station with electric arc equipment. Further use of electricity came from 1904 when electric trains were introduced, using Central Station from 1 July 1904.\\r\\nThe Metro system opened in 1980, taking over and improving many of the Tyneside suburban routes that had declined under British Railways management. The Metro system was a considerable success; it had its own subterranean station below the main line Central Station. Many conventional rail services were transferred there, and several of the east end bays were closed and converted to car parking and other usage. The Carlisle line was diverted to enter Newcastle over the King Edward Bridge of 1906, and a large out-of-town shopping development, the \\"Metro Centre\\", was opened with a station on that line. The changing pattern of railway services meant that terminating trains were significantly fewer and through trains had increased. The emphasis on bay platforms at the station was no longer appropriate.\\r\\nThe opportunity was taken in conjunction with the East Coast Main Line electrification scheme, inaugurated in 1991, to extend the station southwards to provide more through platforms; this encroached on to land occupied by through tracks earlier used by goods trains but seeing little of that class of traffic by now. A new island platform was provided encompassing the southern wall of the station; the two platform faces are divided so as to provide four numbered platforms, 5 to 8, generally used for local trains.[7]\\r\\nAn underground station for Tyne and Wear Metro trains was constructed during the late 1970s, and opened in 1981. Part of the porte-cochre was temporarily dismantled while excavation work took place.[13] The metro station sees 5 million passengers a year and is the third busiest station on the system.\\r\\nNewcastle is a principal stop on the East Coast Main Line. The station is operated by Virgin Trains East Coast.\\r\\nVirgin Trains East Coast provides high-speed inter-city services southbound every half hour to London (one fast, one semi-fast) as well as 3 trains per 2 hours continue northbound into Scotland. One service is also provided each evening Monday - Friday from Newcastle to Sunderland.[18]\\r\\nRolling stock used: Inter-City 225 (Class 91 electric locomotive and DVT) and Inter-City 125 (HST)\\r\\nRolling stock used: Inter-City 225 (Class 91 electric locomotive and DVT).\\r\\nCrossCountry provides a number of services north into Scotland, supplementing Virgin Trains East Coast services, and southbound there are at least 2 trains per hour to the CrossCountry hub at Birmingham from where they are extended towards the South West and South Coast.[19]\\r\\nRolling stock used: Class 220, Class 221 'Voyager' diesel multiple units and Inter-City 125 (HST)\\r\\nNewcastle is a terminus for TransPennine Express providing services to Manchester/Liverpool via Leeds (though some services will be extended through to Edinburgh from December 2019 as part of the new TPE franchise agreement).[20]\\r\\nWith the electrification of the Manchester to Liverpool Line, from May 2014 a new timetable was introduced which is made up an hourly express service between Newcastle and Liverpool via Leeds and Manchester reducing journey times to Liverpool to 3 hours as part of the Northern Hub scheme.[21] Services to Manchester Airport now mainly operate in the early morning/late evening (but will become hourly all day from December 2017). Services to Leeds/York are also supplemented by Virgin Trains East Coast and CrossCountry.\\r\\nRolling stock used: Class 185 \\"Pennine\\" diesel multiple units\\r\\nNorthern provides a number of commuter and regional services?:[22]\\r\\nSome services on the Tyne Valley line extend beyond Carlisle, including one service to Whitehaven and three services to Glasgow Central via the Glasgow South Western Line. The Glasgow services are operated using Abellio ScotRail Class 156s, but operate as Northern services with Northern crew between Newcastle and Carlisle.\\r\\nRolling stock used: Sprinter (Class 156) and Pacer (Class 142) diesel multiple units\\r\\nIn May 2016 ORR gave the green light to a new operator called East Coast Trains which would operate services to Edinburgh Waverley via Stevenage, Newcastle & Morpeth. The operation would begin operation in 2021.[23][24][25]\\r\\nSince the 1990s local councils have considered the feasibility of restoring passenger services linking Ashington and Blyth with Newcastle.[26] The proposal would not include serving Blyth not by reopening the branch to Blyth, but by building a new station at Newsham. In 1998 the Railway Development Society (renamed Railfuture in 2000) endorsed the proposal.[26]\\r\\nDenis Murphy, the Labour MP for Wansbeck, expressed support in the House of Commons in an adjournment debate in April 1999 and again in a debate in January 2007.[27]\\r\\nIn 2009 the Association of Train Operating Companies published a S34 million proposal to restore passenger services from Newcastle to Ashington.[28]\\r\\nNorthumberland County Council is currently developing plans aimed at restoring passenger services along the remaining freight-only section of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway between Benton Junction and new station at Woodhorn, to the east of Ashington. In June 2013 NCC announced that they had commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme.[29] The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of S850,000.[30]\\r\\nThe GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle and Ashington was feasible and could provide economic benefits of S70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034.[31] The scheme would involve the construction of new or reopened stations at Northumberland Park (for interchange with the Tyne and Wear Metro), either Seghill or Seaton Delaval, Newsham, Blyth Park & Ride, Bedlington, Ashington and Woodhorn (for the Woodhorn Museum and Northumberland Archives) with a potential end to end journey time of 37 minutes.[32] If funding for the S191 million[31] scheme can be raised, it has been suggested that detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021.[31]\\r\\nAfter receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail.[33]\\r\\nThe National Rail station has 12 platforms. The arrangement is:\\r\\nPlans were revealed on 30 April 2013 for a major redevelopment,[34] including an S8.6 million project to regenerate the inside of the station,[35] and a further S11.4 million to develop the area surrounding the station.[36] The portico redevelopment was completed in April 2014.[37]\\r\\nThe redevelopment plans contain a number of improvements, including:\\r\\nThe redevelopment plan also includes a number of improvements to the area surrounding the station, including:\\r\\nThe work began in May 2013 and was completed during April 2014 by Miller Construction.[35] The station operated as normal throughout the works.[35] The S8.6 million funding for the internal station work was provided by the Department for Transport's Station Commercial Project Facility Fund.[35] The external works were jointly funded by NE1, Regional Growth Fund and Newcastle City Council.[36]\\r\\nTrains cross the River Tyne on one of two bridges. The older High Level Bridge south-east of the station, designed by Robert Stephenson opened on 27 September 1849. Its location meant north-south trains had to reverse in the station to continue their journey. The King Edward VII Bridge south-west of the station opened on 10 July 1906 allowing north-south trains to continue without reversing. The two bridges enable the trackwork north and south of the river to form a complete circle, allowing trains to be turned if necessary. The former Gateshead depot, next to the connecting tracks on the south side of the Tyne, mirrored Newcastle station.\\r\\nThe station was noted for its complex set of diamond crossings to the east of the station which facilitated access to the High Level Bridge and northbound East Coast Main Line and was said to be the greatest such crossing in the world.[42] The crossing was the subject of many early-1900s post cards, titled The Largest Railway Crossing in the World - photographed from the castle (towards the station), or from the station towards the castle.[43]\\r\\nThe crossing has been simplified in recent years as the opening of the Metro brought about the withdrawal of many heavy-rail suburban services and the closure of the bay platforms they operated from on the north side of the station removing the need for such a complex crossing. Much of this work was carried out in 1988-9 as part of remodelling and resignalling work associated with ECML electrification. A new island platform on the former goods lines was commissioned as part of this work, with signalling control relocated to the Tyneside IECC on the opposite side of the river. Heaton depot is to the north of the station, on the East Coast Main Line.\\r\\nNewcastle station is located above Central metro station on the Tyne and Wear Metro, one of five underground stations serving the city centre. Central is an interchange between the Yellow and Green lines, and is the last stop prior to crossing the River Tyne towards Gateshead.","input":"What is the main train station in newcastle called?"},{"output":"March 27, 2005","context":"The first season of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, began airing in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) on March 27, 2005, and concluded on May 22, 2005. The first season introduces the main character, Meredith Grey, as she enrolls in Seattle Grace Hospital's internship program and faces unexpected challenges and surprises. Season one had nine series regulars, four of whom have been part of the main cast ever since. The season initially served as a mid-season replacement for the legal drama Boston Legal, airing in the Sunday night time slot at 10:00, after Desperate Housewives. Although no clip shows have been produced for this season, the events that occur are recapped in \\"Straight to Heart\\", a clip-show which aired one week before the winter holiday hiatus of the second season ended. The season was officially released on DVD as two-disc Region 1 box set under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season One on February 14, 2006, by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.\\r\\nThe series' protagonist and title character is Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), who is accepted into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. She joins the program as an intern and is assigned to work under their resident Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), along with fellow interns an extremely competitive Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), an insecure Dr. George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), ex model Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and an arrogant Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers). The surgical wing is primarily supervised by the Chief of Surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Dr. Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) is the head of Cardio surgery. Meredith is in a romantic relationship with her attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) a stranger she had a one-night stand with, and is the daughter of the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey (Kate Burton), who now suffers from Alzheimer's.\\r\\nThe season's reviews and critiques were hugely positive, and the series received several awards and nominations for the cast and crew including three nominations at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards including Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Oh. The series also received three nominations at the Golden Globe Award with the series itself being nominated for Best Drama Series, Dempsey nominated for Best Actor in a Drama Series Oh winning the Best Supporting Actress while the entire cast was nominated in the Outstanding Cast ÿ Drama Series category. Oh also won the Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series at the 12th Screen Actors Guild Awards. Chambers and Pompeo were nominated Choice TV Breakout Performances at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards. Peter Horton and Jeffrey Melman were also nominated for the Best Directing ÿ Drama Series, Night for A Hard Day's Night and Into You Like a Train respectively at the 58th Directors Guild of America Awards.\\r\\nThe first five episodes of the second season were conceived, written and shot to air as the final five episodes of the first season,[1] but aired during the 2005-2006 season due to the high number of viewers that watched \\"Who's Zoomin' Who?\\", the season's highest-rated episode with 22.22 million viewers tuning in. The series was chosen in the top ten for several 2005 \\"best of television\\" lists, including USA Today, San Jose Mercury News, The New York Times, The Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was created by Shonda Rhimes and was aired on the ABC Network in the U.S. The season was produced by Touchstone Television, currently ABC Studios,[2] The Mark Gordon Company, ShondaLand Production Company, and was distributed by Buena Vista International, Inc.. The season's executive producers were Rhimes, Betsy Beers, Mark Gordon, James D. Parriott, Krista Vernoff, Rob Corn, and Mark Wilding. The staff writers were Rhimes, Parriott, Ann Hamilton, Vernoff, Kip Koenig, Mimi Schmir, Gabrielle Stanton, and Harry Werksman, Jr.. The directors throughout the season were Peter Horton, Tony Goldwyn, Adam Davidson. John David Coles, Scott Brazil, Darnell Martin, Sarah Pia Anderson, and Wendey Stanzler. Rhimes served as the season's show runner. She and Horton, who wrote and directed the first two episodes respectively, would also have written and directed the season's final two episodes, had they not been transferred into the second season.[3]\\r\\nThe show was announced in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal.[4] It was originally scheduled to run in the Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot for the remainder of the season.[5] ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: \\"Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May.\\"[6] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass.[7] Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: \\"I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.\\"[5] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.[5]\\r\\nNine actors had star billing in the show's first season. Series creator Shonda Rhimes wanted a diverse cast, and so created characters without pre-specified races.[8] Determined not to have a show in which \\"all the extras are white, except the lone janitor\\", she has created what The New York Times has called \\"one of the most colorful backgrounds in television\\".[9] Rhimes used a \\"blind-casting\\" technique, which resulted in several roles going to actors of different racial backgrounds than first envisioned. Isaiah Washington, eventually cast as Preston Burke, was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, while Burke was initially to be played by a white actor who dropped out at the last moment. Chandra Wilson was cast in the role of Miranda Bailey, who Rhimes had imagined as a blonde until auditioning Wilson. The Campus have observed that the Grey's Anatomy cast is actually more diverse than the city it emulates, noting that Seattle is actually 70% Caucasian.[10]\\r\\nThe nine characters who appear as series regulars in the first season all work in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. Five of the characters are interns: Meredith Grey portrayed by Ellen Pompeo, who is in a romantic relationship with her attending Derek Shepherd, and is the daughter of the renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, who now suffers from Alzheimer's; Cristina Yang portrayed by Sandra Oh, an extremely competitive intern who befriends Meredith and begins a sexual relationship with Preston Burke; Izzie Stevens portrayed by Katherine Heigl, an ex model who struggles to be recognized as a doctor; Alex Karev portrayed by Justin Chambers, an arrogant intern who initially irritates his colleagues, and George O'Malley portrayed by T.R. Knight, an insecure intern with a lack of confidence, who develops a crush on Meredith. The interns are mentored by their resident Miranda Bailey portrayed by Chandra Wilson, a disciplined woman who is nicknamed \\"The Nazi\\". The surgical program is led by the Chief of Surgery Dr. Richard Webber portrayed by James Pickens Jr.. In his employ are Preston Burke and Derek Shepherd from New York portrayed by Isaiah Washington and Patrick Dempsey respectively.[11] Guest stars include Meredith's mother Ellis, portrayed by Kate Burton, nurse Olivia Harper, portrayed by Sarah Utterback, who serves as a love interest for George and Alex, and Derek's estranged wife Addison Montgomery, played by Kate Walsh.\\r\\nThe first season's ratings were consistently high, ranking first in its timeslot and leading its closest competition by 7.2 million viewers. It delivered ABC's best audience retention following Desperate Housewives, was the highest rated show amongst 18- to 49-year-olds in 13 years since The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, and produced ABC's strongest series performance in the hour in more than four years.[12] Commenting on the first season's high ratings, Magna Global USA media analyst Steve Sternberg stated: \\"Roughly 80 percent of households during prime time only have one TV set on. People are looking for shows they can watch with other household members. And just as Desperate Housewives reaches a broad audience - younger, older, male, female - so does Grey's Anatomy.\\"[5] The season finale was watched by 22.22 million viewers,[13] and was ranked the ninth in viewership.\\r\\nThe first season of Grey's received mostly positive reviews from the critics. In regard to the first season, New York Daily News named Grey's Anatomy a \\"winner\\",[14] whereas Newsday expressed a positive opinion by stating \\"You simply can't stop watching.\\"[14] Walter Chaw from Film Freak Central said the show was \\"so odious, so repugnant, that it's impossible not to have predicted its newly-minted role as the most popular program in the land.\\"[15] The Washington Post's Tom Shales was critical of the early series, finding it reminiscent of ER and commenting that: \\"The show is much more a matter of commercial calculation than an honest attempt to try something fresh and different\\". He called Rhimes' script for the pilot episode \\"nothing but a casserole made of equal parts ham and corn\\", writing that overall: \\"It's a 'new' show only in the sense that Dr. Frankenstein's monster was a new man.\\"[16] Kate Aurthur for The New York Times deemed the show a hybrid of Ally McBeal, Sex and the City and ER, writing of the news that it had become the highest-rated midseason drama in 12 years that: \\"When you parse its ratings, Grey's Anatomy underscores one of the real lessons of the current season - men will watch shows with a female lead.

Rubik","context":"Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974[1][2] by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern? Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube,[3] the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp. in 1980[4] via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer,[5] and won the German Game of the Year special award for Best Puzzle that year. As of January 2009[update], 350 million cubes had been sold worldwide[6][7] making it the world's top-selling puzzle game.[8][9] It is widely considered to be the world's best-selling toy.[10]\\r\\nOn a classic Rubik's Cube, each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers, each of one of six solid colours: white, red, blue, orange, green, and yellow. In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, and orange is opposite red, and the red, white and blue are arranged in that order in a clockwise arrangement.[11] On early cubes, the position of the colours varied from cube to cube.[12] An internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently, thus mixing up the colours. For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to have only one colour. Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\\r\\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many speedcubers continue to practice it and other twisty puzzles and compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, The World Cube Association, the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, has organised competitions worldwide and kept the official world records.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2G2G2 \\"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together with magnets. Nichols was granted U.S. Patent 3,655,201 on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\\r\\nOn April 9, 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent his \\"Spherical 3G3G3\\". He received his UK patent (1344259) on January 16, 1974.[13]\\r\\nIn the mid-1970s, Ern? Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest.[14] Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had created a puzzle until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore it.[15] Rubik obtained Hungarian patent HU170062 for his \\"Magic Cube\\" in 1975. Rubik's Cube was first called the Magic Cube (B?v?s kocka) in Hungary. Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; of course, that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980.\\r\\nThe first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and released in Budapest toy shops. Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ern? Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.[16] It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.[16] The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg and New York in January and February 1980.\\r\\nAfter its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy shop shelves of the West was briefly halted so that it could be manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A lighter Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. \\"The Gordian Knot\\" and \\"Inca Gold\\" were considered, but the company finally decided on \\"Rubik's Cube\\", and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980.\\r\\nAfter the first batches of Rubik's Cubes were released in May 1980, initial sales were modest, but Ideal began a television advertising campaign in the middle of the year which it supplemented with newspaper adverts.[17] At the end of 1980 Rubik's Cube won a German Game of the Year special award,[18] and won similar awards for best toy in the UK, France, and the US.[19] By 1981 Rubik's Cube had become a craze, and it is estimated that in the period from 1980 to 1983 around 200 million Rubik's Cubes were sold worldwide.[20] In March 1981 the first speedcubing championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich,[18] and a Rubik's Cube was depicted on the front cover of Scientific American that same month.[21] In June 1981 The Washington Post reported that the Rubik's Cube is \\"a puzzle that's moving like fast food right now ... this year's Hoola Hoop or Bongo Board\\",[22] and by September 1981 New Scientist noted that the cube had \\"captivated the attention of children of ages from 7 to 70 all over the world this summer.\\"[23]\\r\\nAs most people could only solve one or two sides, numerous books were published including David Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's \\"Magic Cube\\" (1980) and Patrick Bossert's You Can Do the Cube (1981).[18] At one stage in 1981 three of the top ten best selling books in the US were books on solving the Rubik's Cube,[24] and the best-selling book of 1981 was James G. Nourse's The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube which sold over 6 million copies.[25] In 1981 the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited a Rubik's Cube, and at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee a six-foot Cube was put on display.[18] ABC Television even developed a cartoon show called Rubik, the Amazing Cube.[26] In June 1982 the First Rubik's Cube World Championship took place in Budapest, and would become the only competition recognized as official until the championship was revived in 2003.[27]\\r\\nIn October 1982 The New York Times reported that sales had fallen and that \\"the craze has died\\",[28] and by 1983 it was clear that sales had plummeted.[18] However, in some Communist countries, such as China and USSR, the craze had started later and demand was still high because of a shortage of Cubes.[29][30]\\r\\nRubik's Cubes continued to be marketed and sold throughout the 1980s and 90s,[18] but it was not until the early 2000s that interest in the Cube began increasing again.[31] In the US sales doubled between 2001 and 2003, and The Boston Globe remarked that it was \\"becoming cool to own a Cube again\\".[32] The 2003 World Rubik's Games Championship was the first speedcubing tournament since 1982.[31] It was held in Toronto and was attended by 83 participants.[31] The tournament led to the formation of the World Cube Association in 2004.[31] Annual sales of Rubik branded cubes were said to have reached 15 million worldwide in 2008.[33] Part of the new appeal was ascribed to the advent of Internet video sites, such as YouTube, which allowed fans to share their solving strategies.[33] Following the expiration of Rubik's patent in 2000, other brands of cubes appeared, especially from Chinese companies.[34] Many of these Chinese branded cubes have been engineered for speed and are favoured by speedcubers.[34]\\r\\nTaking advantage of an initial shortage of Cubes, many imitations and variations appeared, many of which may have violated one or more patents. Today, the patents have expired and many Chinese companies produce copies of, and in some cases improvements upon, the Rubik and V-Cube designs.[34]\\r\\nNichols assigned his patent to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued Ideal in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2G2G2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3G3G3 Cube.[35]\\r\\nEven while Rubik's patent application was being processed, Terutoshi Ishigi, a self-taught engineer and ironworks owner near Tokyo, filed for a Japanese patent for a nearly identical mechanism, which was granted in 1976 (Japanese patent publication JP55-008192). Until 1999, when an amended Japanese patent law was enforced, Japan's patent office granted Japanese patents for non-disclosed technology within Japan without requiring worldwide novelty.[36][37] Hence, Ishigi's patent is generally accepted as an independent reinvention at that time.[38][39][40] Rubik applied for more patents in 1980, including another Hungarian patent on October 28. In the United States, Rubik was granted U.S. Patent 4,378,116 on March 29, 1983, for the Cube. This patent expired in 2000.\\r\\nGreek inventor Panagiotis Verdes patented[41] a method of creating cubes beyond the 5G5G5, up to 11G11G11, in 2003.[42] As of 2017, the 5G5G5, 6G6G6, 7G7G7, 8G8G8 and 9G9G9 models are in production in his \\"V-Cube\\" line. V-Cube also produces a 2G2G2, 3G3G3 and a 4G4G4.\\r\\nRubik's Brand Ltd. also holds the registered trademarks for the word Rubik and Rubik's and for the 2D and 3D visualisations of the puzzle. The trademarks have been upheld by a ruling of the General Court of the European Union on 25 November 2014 in a successful defence against a German toy manufacturer seeking to invalidate them. However, European toy manufacturers are allowed to create differently shaped puzzles that have a similar rotating or twisting functionality of component parts such as for example Skewb, Pyraminx or Impossiball.[43]\\r\\nOn 10 November 2016, Rubik's Cube lost a ten-year battle over a key trademark issue. The European Union's highest court, the Court of Justice ruled that the puzzle's shape was not sufficient to grant it trademark protection.[44]\\r\\nA standard Rubik's Cube measures 5.7 centimetres (2?1?4?in) on each side. The puzzle consists of twenty-six unique miniature cubes, also called \\"cubies\\" or \\"cubelets\\". Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes, while permitting them to move to different locations. However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square fa?ade; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. So there are twenty-one pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and twenty smaller plastic pieces which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.\\r\\nEach of the six centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by the centre piece, a \\"3D cross\\". A spring between each screw head and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the \\"feel\\" of the Cube. Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.\\r\\nThe Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45 and then prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to \\"solve\\" a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.\\r\\nThere are six central pieces which show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90, 180 or 270, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.\\r\\nDouglas Hofstadter, in the July 1982 issue of Scientific American, pointed out that Cubes could be coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.[38]\\r\\nThe original (3G3G3) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.[45]\\r\\nwhich is approximately 43 quintillion.[46]\\r\\nThe puzzle was originally advertised as having \\"over 3,000,000,000 (three billion) combinations but only one solution\\".[47] To put this into perspective, if one had as many standard sized Rubik's Cubes as there are permutations, one could cover the Earth's surface 275 times.\\r\\nThe preceding figure is limited to permutations that can be reached solely by turning the sides of the cube. If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number becomes twelve times as large:\\r\\nwhich is approximately 519 quintillion[46] possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the Cube, but only one in twelve of these are actually solvable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus there are twelve possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called \\"universes\\" or \\"orbits\\", into which the Cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.\\r\\nThe original Rubik's Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried the words \\"Rubik's Cube\\" on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a \\"supercube\\". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the Lo Shu magic square or playing card suits. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.\\r\\nMarking the Rubik's Cube's centres increases its difficulty because this expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3G1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9G1022).[48]\\r\\nWhen turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9G1022) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1G1024).\\r\\nIn Rubik's cubers' parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of algorithm, meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.\\r\\nMany algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved, so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle, or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.\\r\\nSome algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects, and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.\\r\\nRubik's Cube lends itself to the application of mathematical group theory, which has been helpful for deducing certain algorithms - in particular, those which have a commutator structure, namely XYX?1Y?1 (where X and Y are specific moves or move-sequences and X?1 and Y?1 are their respective inverses), or a conjugate structure, namely XYX?1, often referred to by speedcubers colloquially as a \\"setup move\\".[49] In addition, the fact that there are well-defined subgroups within the Rubik's Cube group enables the puzzle to be learned and mastered by moving up through various self-contained \\"levels of difficulty\\". For example, one such \\"level\\" could involve solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by Thistlethwaite and Kociemba, which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.\\r\\nMany 3G3G3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by David Singmaster to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \\"Singmaster notation\\".[50] Its relative nature allows algorithms to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\\r\\nWhen a prime symbol (??) follows a letter, it denotes a face turn counter-clockwise, while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. A letter followed by a?2 (occasionally a superscript?2) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. R is right side clockwise, but R' is right side counter-clockwise. The letters x, y, and z are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When x, y or z are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees.\\r\\nThe most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \\"w\\", for \\"wide\\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of Rw is equivalent to one of r.[51]\\r\\nFor methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \\"MES\\" extension to the notation where letters M, E, and S denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm.[52]\\r\\nThe 4G4G4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (F B U D L R) refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (f b u d l r) refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (Rr)'?l2?f' means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6x6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example 3L.\\r\\nAn alternative notation, Wolstenholme notation,[53] is designed to make memorising sequences of moves easier for novices. This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants. The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for clockwise, anticlockwise and 180-degree turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LURULURU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face. Middle layer moves are denoted by adding an M to corresponding face move, so RIM means a 180-degree turn of the middle layer adjacent to the R face.\\r\\nYet another notation appeared in the 1981 book The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube. Singmaster notation was not widely known at the time of publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F) and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, - for anticlockwise and 2 for 180-degree turns.\\r\\nAlthough there are a significant number of possible permutations for the Rubik's Cube, a number of solutions have been developed which allow solving the cube in well under 100 moves.\\r\\nMany general solutions for the Rubik's Cube have been discovered independently. David Singmaster first published his solution in the book Notes on Rubik's \\"Magic Cube\\" in 1981.[49] This solution involves solving the Cube layer by layer, in which one layer (designated the top) is solved first, followed by the middle layer, and then the final and bottom layer. After sufficient practice, solving the Cube layer by layer can be done in under one minute. Other general solutions include \\"corners first\\" methods or combinations of several other methods. In 1982, David Singmaster and Alexander Frey hypothesised that the number of moves needed to solve the Rubik's Cube, given an ideal algorithm, might be in \\"the low twenties\\".[54] In 2007, Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman used computer search methods to demonstrate that any 3G3G3 Rubik's Cube configuration can be solved in 26 moves or fewer.[55][56][57] In 2008, Tomas Rokicki lowered that number to 22 moves,[58][59][60] and in July 2010, a team of researchers including Rokicki, working with Google, proved the so-called \\"God's number\\" to be 20.[61][62] This is optimal, since there exist some starting positions which require a minimum of 20 moves to solve. More generally, it has been shown that an nGnGn Rubik's Cube can be solved optimally in (n2?/?log(n)) moves.[63]\\r\\nIn 1981, thirteen-year-old Patrick Bossert developed a solution for solving the cube, along with a graphical notation, designed to be easily understood by novices.[64] It was subsequently published as You Can Do The Cube and became a best-seller.[65]\\r\\nA solution commonly used by speed cubers was developed by Jessica Fridrich. It is similar to the layer-by-layer method but employs the use of a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross is done first, followed by first layer corners and second layer edges simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece, thus completing the first two layers (F2L). This is then followed by orienting the last layer, then permuting the last layer (OLL and PLL respectively). Fridrich's solution requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but allows the Cube to be solved in only 55 moves on average.\\r\\nPhilip Marshall's The Ultimate Solution to Rubik's Cube takes a different approach, averaging only 65 twists yet requiring the memorisation of only two algorithms. The cross is solved first, followed by the remaining edges, then five corners, and finally the last three corners.[66]\\r\\nA now well-known method was developed by Lars Petrus. In this method, a 2G2G2 section is solved first, followed by a 2G2G3, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a three-move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a possible 32-move algorithm later. The principle behind this is that in layer-by-layer you must constantly break and fix the first layer; the 2G2G2 and 2G2G3 sections allow three or two layers to be turned without ruining progress. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves.\\r\\nThe Roux Method, developed by Gilles Roux, is similar to the Petrus method in that it relies on block building rather than layers, but derives from corners-first methods. In Roux, a 3G2G1 block is solved, followed by another 3G2G1 on the opposite side. Next the corners of the top layer are solved. The cube can then be solved using only moves of the U layer and M slice.[67]\\r\\nIn 1997, Denny Dedmore published a solution described using diagrammatic icons representing the moves to be made, instead of the usual notation.[68]\\r\\nMost beginner solution methods involve solving the cube one layer at a time, using algorithms that preserve what has already been solved. The easiest layer by layer methods require only 3-8 algorithms.[69][70]\\r\\nThe most move optimal online Rubik's Cube solver programs use Herbert Kociemba's Two-Phase Algorithm which can typically determine a solution of 20 moves or less. The user has to set the color configuration of the scrambled cube and the program returns the steps required to solve it.[71]\\r\\nSpeedcubing (or speedsolving) is the practice of trying to solve a Rubik's Cube in the shortest time possible. There are a number of speedcubing competitions that take place around the world.\\r\\nThe first world championship organised by the Guinness Book of World Records was held in Munich on March 13, 1981. All Cubes were moved 40 times and lubricated with petroleum jelly. The official winner, with a record of 38 seconds, was Jury Froeschl, born in Munich. The first international world championship was held in Budapest on June 5, 1982, and was won by Minh Thai, a Vietnamese student from Los Angeles, with a time of 22.95 seconds.\\r\\nSince 2003, the winner of a competition is determined by taking the average time of the middle three of five attempts. However, the single best time of all tries is also recorded. The World Cube Association maintains a history of world records.[72] In 2004, the WCA made it mandatory to use a special timing device called a Stackmat timer.\\r\\nIn addition to the main 3x3x3 event, the WCA also holds events where the cube is solved in different ways:[73]\\r\\nIn blindfolded solving, the contestant first studies the scrambled cube (i.e., looking at it normally with no blindfold), and is then blindfolded before beginning to turn the cube's faces. Their recorded time for this event includes both the time spent examining the cube and the time spent manipulating it.\\r\\nIn multiple blindfolded, all of the cubes are memorised, and then all of the cubes are solved once blindfolded; thus, the main challenge is memorising many - often ten or more - separate cubes. The event is scored not by time but by the number of solved cubes minus the number of unsolved cubes after one hour has elapsed.\\r\\nIn fewest moves solving, the contestant is given one hour to find his or her solution, and must write it down.\\r\\nThere are different variations of Rubik's Cubes with up to seventeen layers: the 2G2G2 (Pocket/Mini Cube), the standard 3G3G3 cube, the 4G4G4 (Rubik's Revenge/Master Cube), and the 5G5G5 (Professor's Cube) being the most well known. The 17G17G17 \\"Over The Top\\" cube (available late 2011) is currently the largest (and most expensive, costing more than a thousand dollars) commercially sold cube. A working design for a 22G22G22 cube exists and was demonstrated in January 2016.[92] Chinese manufacturer ShengShou has been producing cubes in all sizes from 2G2G2 to 10G10G10 (as of late 2013).[93]\\r\\nNon-licensed physical cubes as large as 13G13G13 based on the V-Cube patents are commercially available to the mass-market circa 2015 in China; these represent about the limit of practicality for the purpose of \\"speed-solving\\" competitively (as the cubes become increasingly ungainly and solve-times increase quadratically).\\r\\nThere are many variations[94] of the original cube, some of which are made by Rubik. The mechanical products include the Rubik's Magic, 360, and Twist. Also, electronics like the Rubik's Revolution and Slide were also inspired by the original. One of the newest 3G3G3 Cube variants is the Rubik's TouchCube. Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand. The TouchCube was introduced at the American International Toy Fair in New York on February 15, 2009.[95][96]\\r\\nThe Cube has inspired an entire category of similar puzzles, commonly referred to as twisty puzzles, which includes the cubes of different sizes mentioned above as well as various other geometric shapes. Some such shapes include the tetrahedron (Pyraminx), the octahedron (Skewb Diamond), the dodecahedron (Megaminx), the icosahedron (Dogic). There are also puzzles that change shape such as Rubik's Snake and the Square One.\\r\\nIn 2011, Guinness World Records awarded the \\"largest order Rubiks magic cube\\" to a 17G17G17 cube, made by Oskar van Deventer.[97][98]\\r\\nSince 2015, with the mass production of the Icosaix, all five platonic solids analogous to Rubik's cube (face-turning with cuts one-third from each face, except the Pyraminx, which also has turnable tips) became available. Besides Rubik's cube, the tetrahedron is available as the Pyraminx, the octahedron as the Face Turning Octahedron, the dodecahedron as the Megaminx, and the icosahedron as the Icosaix.\\r\\nSome puzzles have also been created in the shape of the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, such as Alexander's Star (a great dodecahedron).\\r\\nPuzzles have been built resembling the Rubik's Cube or based on its inner workings. For example, a cuboid is a puzzle based on the Rubik's Cube, but with different functional dimensions, such as 2G2G4, 2G3G4, and 3G3G5.[99] Many cuboids are based on 4G4G4 or 5G5G5 mechanisms, via building plastic extensions or by directly modifying the mechanism itself.\\r\\nSome custom puzzles are not derived from any existing mechanism, such as the Gigaminx v1.5-v2, Bevel Cube, SuperX, Toru, Rua, and 1G2G3. These puzzles usually have a set of masters 3D printed, which then are copied using moulding and casting techniques to create the final puzzle.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther Rubik's Cube modifications include cubes that have been extended or truncated to form a new shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3G3. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of Tony Fisher's Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3G3, 4G4, 5G5, and 6G6 versions of the puzzle.\\r\\nPuzzles like the Rubik's Cube can be simulated by computer software, which provide functions such as recording of player metrics, storing scrambled Cube positions, conducting online competitions, analysing of move sequences, and converting between different move notations. Software can also simulate very large puzzles that are impractical to build, such as 100G100G100 and 1,000G1,000G1,000 cubes, as well as virtual puzzles that cannot be physically built, such as 4- and 5-dimensional analogues of the cube.[100][101]\\r\\nMagic Cube 4D, a 4G4G4G4 virtual puzzle\\r\\nMagic Cube 5D, a 3G3G3G3G3 virtual puzzle\\r\\nGoogle has released the Chrome Cube Lab in association with[citation needed] Ern? Rubik. The site has various interactive objects based on Rubik's Cube. Customised versions of Rubik's Cube can be created and uploaded.[102]","input":"The man who invented the rubik's cube?"},{"output":"3 March 1918","context":"The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was a peace treaty signed on 3 March 1918 between the new Bolshevik government of Soviet Russia and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire), that ended Russia's participation in World War I. The treaty was signed at Brest-Litovsk (Polish: Brze?? Litewski; since 1945 Brest), after two months of negotiations. The treaty was agreed upon by the Bolshevik government to stop further advances by German and Austro-Hungarian forces. According to the treaty, Soviet Russia defaulted on all of Imperial Russia's commitments to the Triple Entente alliance.\\r\\nIn the treaty, Bolshevik Russia ceded the Baltic States to Germany; they were meant to become German vassal states under German princelings.[2] Russia also ceded its province of Kars Oblast in the South Caucasus to the Ottoman Empire and recognized the independence of Ukraine. According to Spencer Tucker, a historian of World War I, \\"The German General Staff had formulated extraordinarily harsh terms that shocked even the German negotiator.\\"[3] Congress Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, as Germans refused to recognize the existence of any Polish representatives, which in turn led to Polish protests.[4] When Germans later complained that the Treaty of Versailles of 1919 was too harsh on them, the Allies (and historians favorable to the Allies) responded that it was more benign than Brest-Litovsk.[5]\\r\\nThe treaty was effectively terminated in November 1918,[6] when Germany surrendered to the Allies. However, in the meantime, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, already fighting the Russian Civil War, by the renouncement of Russia's claims on Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine and Lithuania.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1917, Germany and Imperial Russia were stuck in a stalemate on the Eastern Front of World War I and the Russian economy had nearly collapsed under the strain of the war effort. The large numbers of war casualties and persistent food shortages in the major urban centers brought about civil unrest, known as the February Revolution, that forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate. The Russian Provisional Government that replaced the Tsar (initially presided by prince Georgy Lvov, later by Alexander Kerensky), decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Foreign Minister Pavel Milyukov sent the Entente Powers a telegram, known as Milyukov note, affirming to them that the Provisional Government would continue the war with the same war aims that Imperial Russia did.\\r\\nThe pro-war Provisional Government was opposed by the self-proclaimed Petrograd Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, dominated by leftist parties. Its Order No. 1 called for an overriding mandate to soldier committees rather than army officers. The Soviet started to form its own paramilitary power, the Red Guards, in March 1917.\\r\\nThe continuing war led the German Government to agree to a suggestion that they should favor the opposition Communist Party (Bolsheviks), who were proponents of Russia's withdrawal from the war. Therefore, in April 1917, Germany transported Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin and thirty-one supporters in a sealed train from exile in Switzerland to Finland.[7] Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin proclaimed his April Theses, which included a call for turning all political power over to workers' and soldiers' soviets (councils) and an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war. Throughout 1917, Bolsheviks called for the overthrow of the Provisional Government and an end to the war. Following the disastrous failure of the Kerensky Offensive, discipline in the Russian army deteriorated completely. Soldiers would disobey orders, often under the influence of Bolshevik agitation, and set up soldiers' committees to take control of their units after deposing the officers. Russian and German soldiers occasionally fraternized.\\r\\nThe defeat and ongoing hardships of war led to anti-government riots in Petrograd, the \\"July Days\\" of 1917. Several months later, on 7 November (25 October old style), Red Guards seized the Winter Palace and arrested the Provisional Government in what is known as the October Revolution.\\r\\nA top priority of the newly established Soviet government was to end the war. On 8 November 1917 (26 October 1917 O.S) Vladimir Lenin signed the Decree on Peace, which was approved by the Second Congress of the Soviet of Workers', Soldiers', and Peasants' Deputies. The Decree called \\"upon all the belligerent nations and their governments to start immediate negotiations for peace\\" and proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from World War I. Leon Trotsky was appointed Commissar of Foreign Affairs in the new Bolshevik government. In preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers, Leon Trotsky appointed his good friend, Adolph Joffe, to represent the Bolsheviks at the peace conference.\\r\\nOn 15 December 1917, an armistice between Soviet Russia and the Central Powers was concluded. On 22 December, peace negotiations began in Brest-Litovsk.\\r\\nArrangements for the conference were the responsibility of General Max Hoffmann, chief of staff of the Central Power's forces on their Eastern Front (Oberkommando-Ostfront). The delegations that had negotiated the armistice were made stronger. Prominent additions on the Central Power's side were the foreign ministers of Germany Richard von Khlmann and of Austria-Hungary Count Ottokar Czernin, both the Ottoman grand vizier Talat Pasha and Foreign Minister Nassimy Bey. The Bulgarians were headed by Minister of Justice Popoff, who was later joined by Prime Minister Vasil Radoslavov. [8] [9]\\r\\nThe Russian delegation was led by Adolph Joffe who had already led their armistice negotiators, but his group was made more cohesive by eliminating most of the representatives of social groups, like peasants and sailors, and the addition of tsarist general Aleksandr Samoilo and the noted Marxist historian Mikhail Pokrovsky. It still included as the representative for women Anastasia Bizenko, who had assassinated a high Imperial official. Again the negotiators met in the fortress in Brest Litovsk, while the delegates were housed in temporary wooden structure in its courtyards, because the city had been burnt to the ground in 1915 by the retreating Russian army. They were cordially welcomed by the commander of the Eastern Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, who sat with Joffe on the head table at the opening banquet with one hundred guests. [10] As they had during the armistice negotiations both sides continued to eat dinner and supper together amicably intermingled in the officer's mess.\\r\\nWhen the conference convened Khlmann asked Joffe to present the Russian conditions for peace. He made six points, all variations of the Bolshevik slogan of peace with \\"no annexations or indemnities\\". The Central Powers accepted these principles \\"but only in case all belligerents [including the nations of the Entente] without exception pledge themselves to do the same\\". [11] They did not intend to annex territories occupied by force. Joffe telegraphed this marvelous news to Petrograd. Thanks to informal chatting in the mess, one of Hoffmann's aides, Colonel Friedrich Brinckmann, realized that the Russians had optimistically misinterpreted the Central Power's meaning. [12] It fell to Hoffmann to set matters straight at dinner on 27 December: Poland, Lithuania and Courland, already occupied by the Central Powers, were determined to separate from Russia, on the principle of self-determination that the Bolsheviks themselves espoused. Joffe \\"looked as if he had received a blow on the head\\". [13] Pokrovsky wept as he asked how they could speak of \\"peace without annexations when Germany was tearing eighteen provinces away from the Russian state\\". [14] The Germans and Austro-Hungarian planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes. Czernin was beside himself with this hitch that was slowing the negotiations; self-determination was anathema to his government and they urgently needed grain from the east because Vienna was on the verge of starvation. He proposed to make a separate peace. [15] Khlmann warned that if they negotiated separately Germany would immediately withdraw all its divisions from the Austrian front; Czernin dropped that threat. The food crisis in Vienna was eventually eased by \\"forced drafts of grain from Hungary, Poland, and Romania and by a last moment contribution from Germany of 450 truck-loads of flour\\", [16] At the Russian request they agreed to recess the talks for twelve days.\\r\\nThe Russians only hopes were that given time their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote \\"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\\". [17] Therefore Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader.\\r\\nOn the other side there were significant political realignments. On New Years day in Berlin the Kaiser insisted that Hoffmann reveal his views on the future German-Polish border. He advocated taking a small slice of Poland; Hindenburg and Ludendorff wanted much more. They were furious with Hoffmann for breaching the chain of command and wanted him dismissed and sent to command a division. The Kaiser refused, but Ludendorff no longer spoke with Hoffmann on the telephone, now communication was through an intermediary. [18] The German Supreme Commanders were also furious at ruling out of annexations, contending that the peace \\"must increase Germany's material power\\". [19] They denigrated Khlmann and pressed for additional territorial acquisitions. When Hindenburg was asked why they needed the Baltic states he replied, \\"To secure my left flank for when the next war happens.\\" [20] However the most profound transformation was that a delegation from the Ukrainian Rada, which had declared independence from Russia, had arrived at Brest-Litovsk. They would make peace if they were given the Polish city of Cholm and its surroundings, and then would provide desperately needed grain. Czernin no longer was desperate for a prompt settlement with the Russians.\\r\\nWhen they reconvened Trotsky declined the invitation to meet Prince Leopold and terminated shared meals and other sociable interactions with the representatives of the Central Powers. Day after day Trotsky \\"engaged Khlmann in debate, rising to subtle discussion of first principles that ranged far beyond the concrete territorial issues that divided them\\". [21] The Central Powers signed a peace treaty with the Ukraine during the night of 8-9 February, even though the Russian had retaken Kiev. German and Austro-Hungarian troops entered the Ukraine to prop up the Rada. Finally Hoffmann broke the impasse with the Russians by focusing the discussion on maps of the future boundaries. Trotsky summarized their situation \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary are cutting off from the domains of the former Russian Empire territories more than 150,000 square kilometers in size.\\" [22] He was granted a nine day recess for the Russians to decide whether to sign.\\r\\nIn Petrograd Trotsky argued passionately against signing, proposing that instead \\"they should announce the termination of the war and demobilization without signing any peace.\\" [23] Lenin was for signing rather than having an even more ruinous treaty forced on them after a few more weeks of military humiliation. The \\"Left Communists\\", led by Nikolai Bukharin and Karl Radek, were sure that Germany, Austria, Turkey, and Bulgaria were all on the verge of revolution. They wanted to continue the war with a newly-raised revolutionary force while awaiting for these upheavals.[24] Consequently Lenin agreed to Trotsky's formula  a position summed up as \\"no war ÿ no peace\\"  which was announced when the negotiators reconvened on 10 February 1918. The Russians thought their stalling was succeeding until 16 February when Hoffmann notified them that the war would resume in two days, when fifty-three divisions advanced against the near-empty Russian trenches. On the night of 18 February the Central Committee supported Lenin's resolution that they sign the treaty by a margin of seven to five. Hoffmann kept advancing until 23 February when he presented new terms that included the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine and Finland. They were give 48 hours to decide. Lenin told the Central Committee that \\"you must sign this shameful peace in order to save the world revolution\\". [25] If they did not agree he would resign. He was supported by six Central Committee members, opposed by three, with Trotsky and three others abstaining. [26] Trotsky resigned as foreign minister and was replaced by Grigori Sokolnikov.\\r\\nWhen Sokolnikov arrived at Brest-Litovsk he declared \\"we are going to sign immediately the treaty presented to us as an ultimatum but at the same time refuse to enter into any discussion of its terms.\\" [27] The treaty was signed at 17:50 on 3 March, 1918.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918. The signatories were Bolshevik Russia signed by Grigori Yakovlovich Sokolnikov on the one side and the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Ottoman Empire on the other.\\r\\nThe treaty marked Russia's final withdrawal from World War I as an enemy of her co-signatories, on severe terms. In all, the treaty took away territory that included a quarter of the population and industry of the former Russian Empire [28] and nine-tenths of its coal mines.[29]\\r\\nRussia renounced all territorial claims in Finland (which it had already acknowledged), Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Belarus, and Ukraine. The territory of the Kingdom of Poland was not mentioned in the treaty, because Russian Poland had been a personal possession of the Tsar, not part of the Empire.\\r\\nThe treaty stated that \\"Germany and Austria-Hungary intend to determine the future fate of these territories in agreement with their populations.\\" Most of these territories were in effect ceded to Germany, which intended to have them become economic and political dependencies. The many ethnic German residents (volksdeutsch) would be the ruling elite. New monarchies were created in Lithuania and the United Baltic Duchy (which comprised the modern countries of Latvia and Estonia). The German aristocrats Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach (in Lithuania), and Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (in the United Baltic Duchy), were appointed as rulers.\\r\\nThis plan was detailed by German Colonel General Erich Ludendorff, who wrote, \\"German prestige demands that we should hold a strong protecting hand, not only over German citizens, but over all Germans.\\"[30]\\r\\nThe occupation of Western Russia ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin as over one million German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of utilizing Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive and in addition, the local population became increasingly upset at the occupying army. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking out all over the occupied zone, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops had to intervene in Finland to put down an attempted Bolshevik coup, and Ludendorff became increasingly paranoid about his troops being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow; this was one of the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. Despite all this, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.\\r\\nGermany transferred hundreds of thousands of veteran troops to the Western Front for the 1918 Spring Offensive, which shocked the Allies badly, but ultimately failed. Some Germans later blamed the occupation for significantly weakening the Spring Offensive.\\r\\nAt the insistence of Talaat Pasha, the treaty declared that the territory Russia took from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War (1877ÿ1878), specifically Ardahan, Kars, and Batumi, were to be returned. At the time of the treaty, this territory was under the effective control of Armenian and Georgian forces.\\r\\nParagraph 3 of Article IV of the treaty states that:\\r\\nThe districts of Erdehan, Kars, and Batum will likewise and without delay be cleared of Russian troops. Russia will not interfere in the reorganization of the national and international relations of these districts, but leave it to the population of these districts to carry out this reorganization in agreement with the neighboring States, especially with the Ottoman Empire.\\r\\nIn the wake of Russian repudiation of Tsarist bonds, nationalisation of foreign-owned property and confiscation of foreign assets, Russia and Germany signed an additional agreement on 27 August 1918. Russia agreed to pay six billion marks in compensation to German interests for their losses.\\r\\nImmediately after the signing of the treaty, Lenin moved the Soviet Russian government from Petrograd to Moscow.[31] Trotsky blamed the peace treaty on the bourgeoisie, the social revolutionaries,[32] Tsarist diplomats, Tsarist bureaucrats, \\"the Kerenskys, Tseretelis and Chernovs\\"[33] the Tsarist regime, and the \\"petty-bourgeois compromisers\\".[34]\\r\\nRelations between Russia and the victors did not go smoothly. The Ottoman Empire broke the treaty by invading the newly created First Republic of Armenia in May 1918. Joffe became the Russian ambassador to Germany. His priority was distributing propaganda to trigger the German revolution. On 4 November 1918 \\"the Soviet courier's packing-case had 'come to pieces'\\" in a Berlin railway station; [35] it was filled with insurrectionary documents. Joffe and his staff were ejected from Germany in a sealed train on 5 November 1918. In the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended World War I, one clause abrogated the Brest-Litovsk treaty. Next the Bolshevik legislature (VTsIK) annulled the treaty on 13 November 1918, and the text of the VTsIK Decision was printed in Pravda newspaper the next day. In the year after the armistice following a timetable set by the victors the German Army withdrew its occupying forces from the lands gained in Brest-Litovsk. The fate of the region, and the location of the eventual western border of the Soviet Union, was settled in violent and chaotic struggles over the course of the next three and a half years. The PolishÿSoviet War was particularly bitter; it ended with the Treaty of Riga in 1921. Although most of Ukraine fell under Bolshevik control and eventually became one of the constituent republics of the Soviet Union, Poland and the Baltic states emerged as independent countries. In the Treaty of Rapallo, concluded in April 1922, Germany accepted the Treaty's nullification, and the two powers agreed to abandon all war-related territorial and financial claims against each other. This state of affairs lasted until 1939. As a consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union advanced its borders westward by invading Poland in September 1939 and taking a small part of Finland in November 1939 and annexing the Baltic States, Eastern Poland and Bessarabia in 1940. It thus overturned almost all the territorial losses incurred at Brest-Litovsk, except for the main part of Finland, western Congress Poland, and western Armenia.\\r\\nThe Treaty of Brest-Litovsk marked a significant contraction of the territory controlled by the Bolsheviks or that they could lay claim to as effective successors of the Russian Empire. While the independence of Finland and Poland was already accepted by them in principle,[citation needed] the loss of Ukraine and the Baltics created, from the Bolshevik perspective, dangerous bases of anti-Bolshevik military activity in the subsequent Russian Civil War (1918ÿ1922). Indeed, many Russian nationalists and some revolutionaries were furious at the Bolsheviks' acceptance of the treaty and joined forces to fight them. Non-Russians who inhabited the lands lost by Bolshevik Russia in the treaty saw the changes as an opportunity to set up independent states.\\r\\nFor the Western Allies, the terms that Germany imposed on Russia were interpreted as a warning of what to expect if Germany and the other Central Powers won the war. Between Brest-Litovsk and the point when the German military situation in the west became dire, some officials in the German government and high command began to favor offering more lenient terms to the Allies in exchange for their recognition of German gains in the east.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe maps show that Russia's post-1991 western border bears a marked similarity to that imposed by the Brest-Litovsk treaty.\\r\\nEmil Orlik, the Viennese Secessionist artist, attended the conference, at the invitation of Richard von Khlmann. He drew portraits of all the participants, along with a series of smaller caricatures. These were gathered together into a book, Brest-Litovsk, a copy of which was given to each of the participants.[36]","input":"When was the treaty of brest litovsk signed?"},{"output":"traditionally printed in a single vertical line","context":"Haiku () ?listen?(help{info) (plural haiku) is a very short form of Japanese poetry. It is typically characterised by three qualities:\\r\\nModern Japanese haiku (y, gendai-haiku) are increasingly unlikely to follow the tradition of 17 on or to take nature as their subject[citation needed], but the use of juxtaposition continues to be honored in both traditional and modern haiku.[4] There is a common, although relatively recent, perception that the images juxtaposed must be directly observed everyday objects or occurrences.[5]\\r\\nIn Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed in a single vertical line while haiku in English often appear in three lines to parallel the three phrases of Japanese haiku.\\r\\nPreviously called hokku, haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japanese haiku a kireji, or cutting word, typically appears at the end of one of the verse's three phrases. A kireji fills a role somewhat analogous to a caesura in classical western poetry or to a volta in sonnets. Depending on which cutting word is chosen, and its position within the verse, it may briefly cut the stream of thought, suggesting a parallel between the preceding and following phrases, or it may provide a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure.[6]\\r\\nThe fundamental aesthetic quality of both hokku and haiku is that it is internally sufficient, independent of context, and will bear consideration as a complete work.[citation needed] The kireji lends the verse structural support,[7] allowing it to stand as an independent poem.[8][9] The use of kireji distinguishes haiku and hokku from second and subsequent verses of renku; which may employ semantic and syntactic disjuncture, even to the point of occasionally end-stopping a phrase with a sentence-ending particle (, shjoshi). However, renku typically employ kireji.[10]\\r\\nIn English, since kireji have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.\\r\\nThe kireji in the Bash examples \\"old pond\\" and \\"the wind of Mt Fuji\\" are both \\"ya\\" (֧). Neither the remaining Bash example nor the Issa example contain a kireji although they do both balance a fragment in the first five on against a phrase in the remaining 12 on (it may not be apparent from the English translation of the Issa that the first five on mean \\"Edo's rain\\").\\r\\nIn comparison with English verse typically characterized by syllabic meter, Japanese verse counts sound units known as \\"on\\" or morae. Traditional haiku consist of 17 on, in three phrases of five, seven and five on respectively. Among contemporary poems teikei (炒 fixed form) haiku continue to use the 5-7-5 pattern while jiyuritsu (\`j free form) haiku do not.[citation needed] One of the examples below illustrates that traditional haiku masters were not always constrained by the 5-7-5 pattern.\\r\\nAlthough the word \\"on\\" is sometimes translated as \\"syllable\\", one on is counted for a short syllable, two for an elongated vowel or doubled consonant, and one for an \\"n\\" at the end of a syllable. Thus, the word \\"haibun\\", though counted as two syllables in English, is counted as four on in Japanese (ha-i-bu-n); and the word \\"on\\" itself, which English-speakers would view as a single syllable, comprises two on: the short vowel o and the moraic nasal n?. This is illustrated by the Issa haiku below, which contains 17 on but only 15 syllables. Conversely, some sounds, such as \\"kyo\\" () may look like two syllables to English speakers but are in fact a single on (as well as a single syllable) in Japanese.\\r\\nThe word onji (x; \\"sound character\\") is sometimes used in referring to Japanese sound units in English[11] although this word is no longer current in Japanese.[citation needed] In Japanese, each on corresponds to a kana character (or sometimes digraph) and hence ji (or \\"character\\") is also sometimes used as the count unit.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1973, the Haiku Society of America noted that the norm for writers of haiku in English was to use 17 syllables, but they also noted a trend toward shorter haiku.[12]\\r\\nSome translators of Japanese poetry have noted that about 12 syllables in English approximate the duration of 17 Japanese on.[13] Also in translations four lines is more appropriate for the colloquialism of the language and is closest to natural conversational rhythm, necessary to carry the weight of the hokku[14]\\r\\nA haiku traditionally contains a kigo, a word or phrase that symbolizes or implies the season of the poem and which is drawn from a saijiki, an extensive but prescriptive list of such words.\\r\\nKigo are often in the form of metonyms[citation needed] and can be difficult for those who lack Japanese cultural references to spot.[citation needed] The Bash examples below include \\"kawazu\\", \\"frog\\" implying spring, and \\"shigure\\", a rain shower in late autumn or early winter. Kigo are not always included in non-Japanese haiku or by modern writers of Japanese \\"free-form\\" haiku.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe best-known Japanese haiku[15] is Bash's \\"old pond\\":\\r\\nThis separates into on as:\\r\\nTranslated:[16]\\r\\nAnother haiku by Bash:\\r\\nThis separates into on as:\\r\\nTranslated:\\r\\nThis haiku by Bash illustrates that he was not always constrained to a 5-7-5 on pattern. It contains 18 on in the pattern 6-7-5 (\\"\\" or Ƶ is treated as two on.)\\r\\nThis separates into \\"on\\" as:\\r\\nTranslated:\\r\\nThis haiku by Issa[19] illustrates that 17 Japanese on do not always equate to 17 English syllables (\\"nan\\" counts as two on and \\"nonda\\" as three.)\\r\\nThis separates into \\"on\\" as,\\r\\nTranslated:\\r\\nHokku is the opening stanza of an orthodox collaborative linked poem, or renga, and of its later derivative, renku (or haikai no renga). By the time of Matsuo Bash (1644ÿ1694), the hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in haibun (a combination of prose and hokku), and haiga (a combination of painting with hokku). In the late 19th century, Masaoka Shiki (1867ÿ1902) renamed the standalone hokku to haiku.[20] The latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written, and the use of the term hokku to describe a stand-alone poem is considered obsolete.[21]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, two masters arose who elevated haikai and gave it a new popularity. They were Matsuo Bash (1644ÿ1694) and Ueshima Onitsura?(ja) (1661ÿ1738). Hokku is the first verse of the collaborative haikai or renku, but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition. Even though hokku had sometimes appeared individually, they were always understood in the context of renku.[22] The Bash school promoted standalone hokku by including many in their anthologies, thus giving birth to what is now called \\"haiku\\". Bash also used his hokku as torque points [clarification needed] within his short prose sketches and longer travel diaries. This subgenre of haikai is known as haibun. His best-known work, Oku no Hosomichi, or Narrow Roads to the Interior, is counted as one of the classics of Japanese literature[23] and has been translated into English extensively.\\r\\nBash was deified by both the imperial government and Shinto religious headquarters one hundred years after his death because he raised the haikai genre from a playful game of wit to sublime poetry. He continues to be revered as a saint of poetry in Japan, and is the one name from classical Japanese literature that is familiar throughout the world.[24]\\r\\nThe next famous style of haikai to arise was that of Yosa Buson (1716ÿ1783) and others such as Kit, called the Tenmei style after the Tenmei Era (1781ÿ1789) in which it was created.\\r\\nBuson is recognized as one of the greatest masters of haiga (an art form where painting is combined with haiku or haikai prose). His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his haiku.[25]\\r\\nNo new popular style followed Buson. However, a very individualistic, and at the same time humanistic, approach to writing haiku was demonstrated by the poet Kobayashi Issa (1763ÿ1827), whose miserable childhood, poverty, sad life, and devotion to the Pure Land sect of Buddhism are evident in his poetry. Issa made the genre immediately accessible to wider audiences.\\r\\nMasaoka Shiki (1867ÿ1902) was a reformer and modernizer. A prolific writer, even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, Shiki disliked the 'stereotype' haikai writers of the 19th century who were known by the deprecatory term tsukinami, meaning 'monthly', after the monthly or twice-monthly haikai gatherings of the end of the 18th century (in regard to this period of haikai, it came to mean 'trite' and 'hackneyed'). Shiki also criticized Bash.[citation needed] Like the Japanese intellectual world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly influenced by Western culture. He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of plein-air painting, which he adapted to create a style of haiku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called shasei (ދ, \\"sketching from life\\"). He popularized his views by verse columns and essays in newspapers.\\r\\nHokku up to the time of Shiki, even when appearing independently, were written in the context of renku.[22] Shiki formally separated his new style of verse from the context of collaborative poetry. Being agnostic,[26] he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism. Further, he discarded the term \\"hokku\\" and proposed the term haiku as an abbreviation of the phrase \\"haikai no ku\\" meaning a verse of haikai,[27] although the term predates Shiki by some two centuries, when it was used to mean any verse of haikai.[citation needed] Since then, \\"haiku\\" has been the term usually applied in both Japanese and English to all independent haiku, irrespective of their date of composition. Shiki's revisionism dealt a severe blow to renku and surviving haikai schools. The term \\"hokku\\" is now used chiefly in its original sense of the opening verse of a renku, and rarely to distinguish haiku written before Shiki's time.[citation needed]\\r\\nHaibun is a combination of prose and haiku, often autobiographical or written in the form of a travel journal.\\r\\nHaiga is a style of Japanese painting based on the aesthetics of haikai, and usually including a haiku. Today, haiga artists combine haiku with paintings, photographs and other art.\\r\\nThe carving of famous haiku on natural stone to make poem monuments known as kuhi () has been a popular practice for many centuries. The city of Matsuyama has more than two hundred kuhi.\\r\\nThe earliest westerner known to have written haiku was the Dutchman Hendrik Doeff (1764ÿ1837), who was the Dutch commissioner in the Dejima trading post in Nagasaki, during the first years of the 19th century.[28] One of his haiku:[29]\\r\\ninazuma no?ۤڼ\\r\\nkaina wo karan?ë|\\r\\nkusamakura?\\r\\nlend me your arms,\\r\\nfast as thunderbolts,\\r\\nfor a pillow on my journey.\\r\\nAlthough there were further attempts outside Japan to imitate the \\"hokku\\" in the early 20th century, there was little understanding of its principles.[citation needed] Early Western scholars such as Basil Hall Chamberlain (1850ÿ1935) and William George Aston were mostly dismissive of hokku's poetic value. One of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet Yone Noguchi. In \\"A Proposal to American Poets,\\" published in the Reader magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his own English efforts, ending with the exhortation, \\"Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!\\" At about the same time the poet Sadakichi Hartmann was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.\\r\\nIn France, haiku was introduced by Paul-Louis Couchoud around 1906. Couchoud's articles were read by early Imagist theoretician F. S. Flint, who passed on Couchoud's ideas to other members of the proto-Imagist Poets' Club such as Ezra Pound. Amy Lowell made a trip to London to meet Pound and find out about haiku. She returned to the United States where she worked to interest others in this \\"new\\" form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound's \\"In a Station of the Metro\\" of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by Yone Noguchi to explain \\"the hokku spirit\\", there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.[citation needed]\\r\\nR. H. Blyth was an Englishman who lived in Japan. He produced a series of works on Zen, haiku, senry, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of Haiku, the four-volume work by Blyth, haiku were introduced to the post-war English-speaking world. This four-volume series (1949ÿ52) described haiku from the pre-modern period up to and including Shiki. Blyth's History of Haiku (1964) in two volumes is regarded as a classical study of haiku. Today Blyth is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to English speakers. His works have stimulated the writing of haiku in English.\\r\\nThe Japanese-American scholar and translator Kenneth Yasuda published The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku. In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5ÿ7ÿ5 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language.[30] Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \\"haiku moment\\" based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified'[31] ). This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.(See however, 'Shiki's Haiku Moments for Us Today'[32]\\r\\nIn 1958, An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bash? to Shiki by Harold G. Henderson was published by Doubleday Anchor Books. This book was a revision of Henderson's earlier book titled The Bamboo Broom (Houghton Mifflin, 1934). After World War II, Henderson and Blyth worked for the American Occupation in Japan and for the Imperial Household, respectively, and their shared appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two.\\r\\nHenderson translated every hokku and haiku into a rhymed tercet (a-b-a), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that 17 syllables in English are generally longer than the 17 on of a traditional Japanese haiku. Because the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual meter rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals.[citation needed] Nevertheless, many of Henderson's translations were in the five-seven-five pattern.\\r\\nThe first haiku written in English was by Ezra Pound, published in 1913. Since then, the haiku has become a fairly popular form among English-speaking poets. English haiku can follow the traditional Japanese rules, but are frequently less strict, particularly concerning the number of syllables and subject matter.\\r\\nThe loosening of traditional standards has resulted in the term \\"haiku\\" being applied to brief English-language poems such as \\"mathemaku\\" and other kinds of pseudohaiku. Some sources claim that this is justified by the blurring of definitional boundaries in Japan.[33] Rich cross cultural haiku traditions continue to this day, evidenced by books like Baseball Haiku: American and Japanese Haiku and Senryu on Baseball edited by Cor van den Heuvel and Nanae Tamura (W.W. Norton 2007).\\r\\nSubsequent to Paul-Louis Couchouds popularisation of the form in France through his essays and translations,[34] the next major haiku collection to appear there was the sequence of war poems by Julien Vocance, Cent visions de guerre (1916).[35] Later haiku by him were included among the work of the twelve published together in the Nouvelle Revue Fran?aise (No.?84, September 1920), among whom was the young Paul luard.[36] This was followed by the anthology Le Ha?ka? Fran?ais in 1923.\\r\\nIn Spain several prominent poets experimented with haiku, including Joan Alcover, Antonio Machado, Juan Ram܇n Jimnez and Luis Cernuda.[37] Federico Garca Lorca also experimented with and learned conciseness from the form while still a student in 1921.[38] The most persistent, however, was Isaac del Vando, whose La Sombrilla Japonesa (1924) went through several editions.[39] The form was also used in Catalan by the avant-garde writers Josep Maria Junoy (1885-1955) and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, by the latter notably in his sequence Vibracions (1921).[40]\\r\\nThe Mexican poet Jos Juan Tablada is credited with popularising haiku in his country, reinforced by the publication of two collections composed entirely in that form: Un dia (1919),[41] and El jarro de flores (1922).[42] In the introduction to the latter, Tablada noted that two young Mexicans, Rafael Lozano and Carlos Gutirrez Cruz, had also begun writing them. They were followed soon after by Carlos Pellicer, Xavier Villaurrutia, and by Jaime Torres Bodet in his collection Biombo (1925).[43] Much later, Octavio Paz included many haiku in Piedras Sueltas (1955).[44]\\r\\nElsewhere the Ecuadorian poet and diplomat Jorge Carrera Andrade included haiku among the 31 poems contained in Microgramas (Tokio 1940)[45] and the Argentine Jorge Luis Borges in the collection La cifra (1981).[46] After several early false starts in Portungese-speaking Brazil, including a collection of 56 by Waldomiro Siqueira Jr. (1912-?) in his Haikais (S?o Paulo 1933), the form was popularised by Guilherme de Almeida, first through his 1937 magazine article Os Meus Haicais and then in his collection Poesia Vria (1947).[47]\\r\\nIn 1992 Nobel laureate Czes?aw Mi?osz published the volume Haiku in which he translated from English to Polish haiku of Japanese masters and American and Canadian contemporary haiku authors.\\r\\nThe former president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, is a notable haijin (??, haiku poets) and known as \\"Haiku Herman.\\" He published a book of haiku in April 2010.[48][49][50]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed haiku in Bengali. He also translated some from Japanese. In Gujarati, Jhinabhai Desai 'Sneharashmi' popularized haiku[51] and remained a popular haiku writer.[52] In February 2008, the World Haiku Festival was held in Bangalore, gathering haijin from all over India and Bangladesh, as well as from Europe and the United States.[citation needed] In South Asia, some other poets also write Haiku from time to time, most notably including the Pakistani poet Omer Tarin, who is also active in the movement for global nuclear disarmament and some of his 'Hiroshima Haiku' have been read at various peace conferences in Japan and the UK.","input":"How many lines can a haiku poem have?"},{"output":"Confederate General Braxton Bragg","context":"Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is a military installation of the United States Army and is the largest military installation in the world (by population) with more than 50,000 active duty personnel.[1] The installation is located within Cumberland, Hoke, Harnett and Moore counties. The installation borders the towns of Fayetteville, Spring Lake and Southern Pines. It was also a census-designated place in the 2010 Census, during which a population of 39,457 was identified. It is named for Confederate General Braxton Bragg. It covers over 251 square miles (650?km2). It is the home of the Army's XVIII Airborne Corps and is the headquarters of the United States Army Special Operations Command, which oversees the U.S. Army 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne) (Provisional) and 75th Ranger Regiment.[2] It is also home to the U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army Reserve Command, and Womack Army Medical Center. Fort Bragg maintains two airfields: Pope Field, where the United States Air Force stations global airlift and special operations assets as well as the Air Force Combat Control School, and Simmons Army Airfield, where Army aviation units support the needs of airborne and special operations forces on post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCamp Bragg was established in 1918 as an artillery training ground. The Chief of Field Artillery, General William J. Snow, was seeking an area having suitable terrain, adequate water, rail facilities and a climate for year-round training, and he decided that the area now known as Fort Bragg met all of the desired criteria.[4] Camp Bragg was named to honor a native North Carolinian, Braxton Bragg, who commanded Confederate States Army forces in the Civil War.\\r\\nThe aim was for six artillery brigades to be stationed there and $6,000,000 was spent on the land and cantonments.[5] There was an airfield on the camp used by aircraft and balloons for artillery spotters. The airfield was named Pope Field on April 1, 1919, in honor of First Lieutenant Harley H. Pope,[5] an airman who was killed while flying nearby. The work on the camp was finished on November 1, 1919.[5]\\r\\nThe original plan for six brigades was abandoned after World War I ended[5] and once demobilization had started. The artillery men, their equipment and material from Camp McClellan, Alabama, were moved over to Fort Bragg and testing began on long-range weapons that were a product of the war.[5] The six artillery brigades were reduced to two cantonments and a garrison was to be built for Army troops as well as a National Guard training center.[5] In early 1921 two field artillery units, the 13th and 17th Field Artillery Brigades, began training at Camp Bragg. The same year, the Long Street Church and six acres of property were acquired for the reservation.[6] The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.[7]\\r\\nDue to the post-war cutbacks, the camp was nearly closed for good when the War department issued orders to close the camp on August 7, 1921. General Albert J. Bowley was commander at the camp and after much campaigning, and getting the Secretary of War to visit the camp, the closing order was cancelled on September 16, 1921. The Field Artillery Board was transferred to Fort Bragg on February 1, 1922.\\r\\nCamp Bragg was renamed Fort Bragg, to signify becoming a permanent Army post, on September 30, 1922. From 1923 to 1924 permanent structures were constructed on Fort Bragg, including four barracks.[5]\\r\\nBy 1940, during World War II, the population of Fort Bragg had reached 5,400; however, in the following year, that number ballooned to 67,000. Various units trained at Fort Bragg during World War II, including the 9th Infantry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 82nd Airborne Division, 100th Infantry Division, and various field artillery groups. The population reached a peak of 159,000 during the war years.[8]\\r\\nFollowing World War II, the 82nd Airborne Division was permanently stationed at Fort Bragg, the only large unit there for some time. In July 1951, the XVIII Airborne Corps was reactivated at Fort Bragg. Fort Bragg became a center for unconventional warfare, with the creation of the Psychological Warfare Center in April 1952, followed by the 10th Special Forces Group.[9]\\r\\nIn 1961, the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) was activated at Fort Bragg, with the mission of training counter-insurgency forces in Southeast Asia. Also in 1961, the \\"Iron Mike\\" statue, a tribute to all Airborne soldiers, past, present and future, was dedicated. In early 1962 the 326 Army Security Agency Company, de-activated after the Korean War, was reactivated at Ft. Bragg under XVIII Corps. In August of that year, an operational contingent of that Company was relocated to Homestead AFB Florida, due to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Circa 1963, that contingent was reassigned to the newly created USASA 6th Field Station.[10] More than 200,000 young men underwent basic combat training here during the period 1966ÿ70. At the peak of the Vietnam War in 1968, Fort Bragg's military population rose to 57,840. In June 1972, the 1st Corps Support Command arrived at Fort Bragg.[11]\\r\\nIn the 1980s, there was a series of deployments of tenant units to the Caribbean, first to Grenada in 1983, Honduras in 1988, and to Panama in 1989. The 5th Special Forces Group departed Fort Bragg in the late 1980s.[12]\\r\\nIn 1990, the XVIII Airborne Corps and the 82nd Airborne Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In the mid- and late 1990s, there was increased modernization of the facilities in Fort Bragg. The World War II wooden barracks were largely removed, a new main post exchange was built, and Devers Elementary School was opened, along with several other projects.[13]\\r\\nAs a result of campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, the units on Fort Bragg have seen a sizeable increase to their operations tempo (OPTEMPO), with units conducting two, three, or even four or more deployments to combat zones. As directed by law, and in accordance with the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort McPherson, Georgia, closed and U.S. Army Forces Command and U.S. Army Reserve Command relocated to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. A new FORSCOM/U.S. Army Reserve Command Headquarters facility completed construction at Fort Bragg in June 2011. Forces Command hosted June 24, 2011 an Army \\"Casing of the Colors\\" ceremony on Fort McPherson and an \\"uncasing of colors ceremony\\" on August 1, 2011, at Fort Bragg. On March 1, 2011, Pope Field, the former Pope Air Force Base, was absorbed into Fort Bragg.\\r\\nThe major commands at the installation are the United States Army Forces Command, the United States Army Reserve Command, and the United States Army Special Operations Command. Several airborne and special operations units of the United States Army are stationed at Fort Bragg, notably the 82nd Airborne Division, the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne), and the Delta Force. The latter is controlled by the Joint Special Operations Command, based at Pope Field within Fort Bragg.\\r\\nFort Bragg is at 358'21\\" north, 7859'57\\" west (35.139064, ?78.999143).[14]\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the post has a total area of 19.0?square miles (49.2?km2), of which, 19.0?square miles (49.1?km2) of it is land and 0.1?square miles (0.2?km2) of it is water.

This caused a tremendous problem for Fort Bragg, where many of these birds lived. Training stopped, ranges were closed, and troops were temporarily moved to other installations for training.\\r\\nThe Army and the conservationists eventually came to an agreement, which put in place training restrictions around the woodpeckers' habitat. White stripes were painted on trees to indicate the location of the habitats, and restrictions limited the scope and duration of training that could take place within 200 feet of these locations.\\r\\nToday, the clusters of woodpeckers has more than doubled in size (200 to 493), and many of the training restrictions have been lifted.[15]\\r\\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there are 29,183 people, 4,315 households, and 4,215 families residing on the base.

Julian Huxley coined the term in his 1942 book, Evolution: The Modern Synthesis.\\r\\nThe 19th century ideas of natural selection and Mendelian genetics were put together with population genetics, early in the twentieth century. The modern synthesis also addressed the relationship between the broad-scale changes of macroevolution seen by palaeontologists and the small-scale microevolution of local populations of living organisms. The synthesis was defined differently by its founders, with Ernst Mayr in 1959, G. Ledyard Stebbins in 1966 and Theodosius Dobzhansky in 1974 offering differing numbers of basic postulates, though they all included natural selection, working on heritable variation supplied by mutation. Other major figures in the synthesis included E. B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch, Ivan Schmalhausen, and George Gaylord Simpson. An early event in the modern synthesis was R. A. Fisher's 1918 paper on mathematical population genetics, but William Bateson, and separately Udny Yule, were already starting to show how Mendelian genetics could work in evolution in 1902.\\r\\nDifferent syntheses followed, accompanying the gradual breakup of the early 20th century synthesis, including with social behaviour in E. O. Wilson's sociobiology in 1975, evolutionary developmental biology's integration of embryology with genetics and evolution, starting in 1977, and Massimo Pigliucci's proposed extended evolutionary synthesis of 2007. In the view of the evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin in 2009, the modern synthesis will be replaced by a 'post-modern' synthesis that will include revolutionary changes in molecular biology, the study of prokaryotes and the resulting tree of life, and genomics.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was successful in convincing most biologists that evolution had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that natural selection was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of Lamarckism (inheritance of acquired characteristics), orthogenesis (progressive evolution), saltationism (evolution by jumps) and mutationism (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives.[4] Alfred Russel Wallace advocated a selectionist version of evolution, and unlike Darwin completely rejected Lamarckism.[5] In 1880, Wallace's view was labelled neo-Darwinism by Samuel Butler.[6][7]\\r\\nFrom the 1880s onwards, there was a widespread belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley's phrase) grew out of the weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin correctly noted in 1868.[8][9] This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing from all parts of the body, actually implied Lamarckism as well as blending.[10][11][12]\\r\\nAugust Weismann's idea, set out in his 1892 book Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung (The Germ Plasm: a Theory of Inheritance),[13] was that the hereditary material, which he called the germ plasm, and the rest of the body (the soma) had a one-way relationship: the germ-plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ-plasm, except indirectly in its participation in a population subject to natural selection. If correct, this made Darwin's pangenesis wrong, and Lamarckian inheritance impossible. His experiment on mice, cutting off their tails and showing that their offspring had normal tails, demonstrated that inheritance was 'hard'.[b] He argued strongly and dogmatically[15] for Darwinism and against Lamarckism, polarising opinions among other scientists. This increased anti-Darwinian feeling, contributing to its eclipse.[16][17]\\r\\nWhile carrying out breeding experiments to clarify the mechanism of inheritance in 1900, Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work. News of this reached William Bateson in England, who reported on the paper during a presentation to the Royal Horticultural Society in May 1900.[18] In Mendelian inheritance, the contributions of each parent retain their integrity rather than blending with the contribution of the other parent. In the case of a cross between two true-breeding varieties such as Mendel's round and wrinkled peas, the first-generation offspring are all alike, in this case all round. Allowing these to cross, the original characteristics reappear (segregation): about 3/4 of their offspring are round, 1/4 wrinkled. There is a discontinuity between the appearance of the offspring; de Vries coined the term allele for a variant form of an inherited characteristic.[19] This reinforced a major division of thought, already present in the 1890s, between gradualists who followed Darwin, and saltationists such as Bateson.[20]\\r\\nThe two schools were the Mendelians, such as Bateson and de Vries, who favoured mutationism, evolution driven by mutation, based on genes whose alleles segregated discretely like Mendel's peas;[21][22] and the biometric school, led by Karl Pearson and Walter Weldon. The biometricians argued vigorously against mutationism, saying that empirical evidence indicated that variation was continuous in most organisms, not discrete as Mendelism seemed to predict; they wrongly believed that Mendelism inevitably implied evolution in discontinuous jumps.[23][24]\\r\\nA traditional view is that the biometricians and the Mendelians rejected natural selection and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only resolved by the development of population genetics.[23][25] A more recent view is that Bateson, de Vries, Thomas Hunt Morgan and Reginald Punnett had by 1918 formed a synthesis of Mendelism and mutationism. The understanding achieved by these geneticists spanned the action of natural selection on alleles (alternative forms of a gene), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the evolution of continuously-varying traits (like height), and the probability that a new mutation will become fixed. In this view, the early geneticists accepted natural selection but rejected Darwin's non-Mendelian ideas about variation and heredity, and the synthesis began soon after 1900.[26][27] The traditional claim that Mendelians rejected the idea of continuous variation is false; as early as 1902, Bateson and Saunders wrote that \\"If there were even so few as, say, four or five pairs of possible allelomorphs, the various homo- and hetero-zygous combinations might, on seriation, give so near an approach to a continuous curve, that the purity of the elements would be unsuspected\\".[28] Also in 1902, the statistician Udny Yule showed mathematically that given multiple factors, Mendel's theory enabled continuous variation. Yule criticised Bateson's approach as confrontational,[29] but failed to prevent the Mendelians and the biometricians from falling out.[30]\\r\\nStarting in 1906, William Castle carried out a long study of the effect of selection on coat colour in rats. The piebald or hooded pattern was recessive to the grey wild type. He crossed hooded rats with the black-backed Irish type, and then back-crossed the offspring with pure hooded rats. The dark stripe on the back was bigger. He then tried selecting different groups for bigger or smaller stripes for 5 generations, and found that it was possible to change the characteristics way beyond the initial range of variation. This effectively refuted de Vries's claim that continuous variation was caused by the environment and could not be inherited. By 1911 Castle noted that the results could be explained by Darwinian selection on heritable variation of a sufficient number of Mendelian genes.[31]\\r\\nThomas Hunt Morgan began his career in genetics as a saltationist, and started out trying to demonstrate that mutations could produce new species in fruit flies. However, the experimental work at his lab with the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster[c] demonstrated that rather than creating new species in a single step, mutations increased the supply of genetic variation in the population.[33] By 1912, after years of work on the genetics of fruit flies, Morgan showed that these insects had many small Mendelian factors (discovered as mutant flies) on which Darwinian evolution could work as if variation was fully continuous. The way was open for geneticists to conclude that Mendelism supported Darwinism.[34]\\r\\nThe theoretical biologist and philosopher of biology Joseph Henry Woodger led the introduction of positivism into biology with his 1929 book Biological Principles. He saw a mature science as being characterised by a framework of hypotheses that could be verified by facts established by experiments. He criticised the traditional natural history style of biology, including the study of evolution, as immature science, since it relied on narrative.[35] Woodger set out to play for biology the role of Robert Boyle's 1661 Sceptical Chymist, intending to convert the subject into a formal, unified science, and ultimately, following the Vienna Circle of logical positivists like Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, to reduce biology to physics and chemistry. His efforts stimulated the biologist J. B. S. Haldane to push for the axiomatisation of biology, and by influencing thinkers such as Huxley, helped to bring about the modern synthesis.[35] The positivist climate made natural history unfashionable, and in America, research and university-level teaching on evolution declined almost to nothing by the late 1930s. The Harvard physiologist William John Crozier told his students that evolution was not even a science: \\"You can't experiment with two million years!\\"[36]\\r\\nThe tide of opinion turned with the adoption of mathematical modelling and controlled experimentation in population genetics, combining genetics, ecology and evolution in a framework acceptable to positivism.[37]\\r\\nIn 1918, R. A. Fisher wrote the paper \\"The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance,\\"[38] which showed mathematically how continuous variation could result from a number of discrete genetic loci. In this and subsequent papers culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection,[39] Fisher showed how Mendelian genetics was consistent with the idea of evolution driven by natural selection.[40][d]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s, a series of papers by J. B. S. Haldane applied mathematical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths.[40] Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed.[42] Both workers, and others such as Dobzhansky and Wright, explicitly intended to bring biology up to the philosophical standard of the physical sciences, making it firmly based in mathematical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment. Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation about history, was becoming predictable, measurable, and testable.[43]\\r\\nThe traditional view is that developmental biology played little part in the modern synthesis,[44] but in his 1930 book Embryos and Ancestors, the evolutionary embryologist Gavin de Beer anticipated evolutionary developmental biology[45] by showing that evolution could occur by heterochrony,[46] such as in the retention of juvenile features in the adult.[47] This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the fossil record, since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position.[48] However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.[49][50][e]\\r\\nThe population geneticist Sewall Wright focused on combinations of genes that interacted as complexes, and the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations, which could exhibit genetic drift. In a 1932 paper, he introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which would in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks.[40][52] Wright's model would appeal to field naturalists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr who were becoming aware of the importance of geographical isolation in real world populations.[42] The work of Fisher, Haldane and Wright helped to found the discipline of theoretical population genetics.[53][54][55]\\r\\nTheodosius Dobzhansky, an emigrant from the Soviet Union to the United States, who had been a postdoctoral worker in Morgan's fruit fly lab, was one of the first to apply genetics to natural populations. He worked mostly with Drosophila pseudoobscura. He says pointedly: \\"Russia has a variety of climates from the Arctic to sub-tropical... Exclusively laboratory workers who neither possess nor wish to have any knowledge of living beings in nature were and are in a minority.\\"[56] Not surprisingly, there were other Russian geneticists with similar ideas, though for some time their work was known to only a few in the West. His 1937 work Genetics and the Origin of Species[57] was a key step in bridging the gap between population geneticists and field naturalists. It presented the conclusions reached by Fisher, Haldane, and especially Wright in their highly mathematical papers in a form that was easily accessible to others.[40][42] Further, Dobzhansky asserted that evolution was based on material genes, arranged in a string on physical hereditary structures, the chromosomes, and linked more or less strongly to each other according to their physical distances from each other on the chromosomes. As with Haldane and Fisher, Dobzhansky's \\"evolutionary genetics\\"[58] was a genuine science, now unifying cell biology, genetics, and both micro- and macroevolution.[43] His work emphasized that real world populations had far more genetic variability than the early population geneticists had assumed in their models, and that genetically distinct sub-populations were important. Dobzhansky argued that natural selection worked to maintain genetic diversity as well as driving change. He was influenced by his exposure in the 1920s to the work of Sergei Chetverikov, who had looked at the role of recessive genes in maintaining a reservoir of genetic variability in a population before his work was shut down by the rise of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union.[40][42] By 1937, Dobzhansky was able to argue that mutations were the main source of evolutionary changes and variability, along with chromosome rearrangements, effects of genes on their neighbours during development, and polyploidy. Next, genetic drift (he used the term in 1941), selection, migration, and geographical isolation could change gene frequencies. Thirdly, mechanisms like ecological or sexual isolation and hybrid sterility could fix the results of the earlier processes.[59]\\r\\nE. B. Ford was an experimental naturalist who wanted to test natural selection in nature, virtually inventing the field of ecological genetics.[60] His work on natural selection in wild populations of butterflies and moths was the first to show that predictions made by R. A. Fisher were correct. In 1940, he was the first to describe and define genetic polymorphism, and to predict that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease.[60][61] His 1949 book Mendelism and Evolution[62] helped to persuade Dobzhansky to change the emphasis in the third edition of his famous textbook Genetics and the Origin of Species from drift to selection.[63]\\r\\nIvan Schmalhausen developed the theory of stabilizing selection, the idea that selection can preserve a trait at some value, publishing a paper in Russian titled \\"Stabilizing selection and its place among factors of evolution\\" in 1941 and a monograph Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection[64] in 1945. He developed it from J. M. Baldwin's 1902 concept that changes induced by the environment will ultimately be replaced by hereditary changes (including the Baldwin effect on behaviour), following that theory's implications to their Darwinian conclusion, and bringing him into conflict with Lysenkoism. Schmalhausen observed that stabilizing selection would remove most variations from the norm, most mutations being harmful.[65][66][67] Dobzhansky called the work \\"an important missing link in the modern view of evolution\\".[68]\\r\\nIn 1942, Julian Huxley's serious but popularising[69][70] Evolution: The Modern Synthesis[2] introduced a name for the synthesis and intentionally set out to promote a \\"synthetic point of view\\" on the evolutionary process. He imagined a wide synthesis of many sciences: genetics, developmental physiology, ecology, systematics, palaeontology, cytology, and mathematical analysis of biology, and assumed that evolution would proceed differently in different groups of organisms according to how their genetic material was organised and their strategies for reproduction, leading to progressive but varying evolutionary trends.[70] His vision was of an \\"evolutionary humanism\\",[71] with a system of ethics and a meaningful place for \\"Man\\" in the world grounded in a unified theory of evolution which would demonstrate progress leading to man at its summit. Natural selection was in his view a \\"fact of nature capable of verification by observation and experiment\\", while the \\"period of synthesis\\" of the 1920s and 1930s had formed a \\"more unified science\\",[71] rivalling physics and enabling the \\"rebirth of Darwinism\\".[71]\\r\\nHowever, the book was not the research text that it appeared to be. In the view of the philosopher of science Michael Ruse, and in Huxley's own opinion, Huxley was \\"a generalist, a synthesizer of ideas, rather than a specialist\\".[69] Ruse observes that Huxley wrote as if he were adding empirical evidence to the mathematical framework established by Fisher and the population geneticists, but that this was not so. Huxley avoided mathematics, for instance not even mentioning Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection. Instead, Huxley used a mass of examples to demonstrate that natural selection is powerful, and that it works on Mendelian genes. The book was successful in its goal of persuading readers of the reality of evolution, effectively illustrating topics such as island biogeography, speciation, competition. Huxley further showed that the appearance of long-term orthogenetic trends ÿ predictable directions for evolution ÿ in the fossil record were readily explained as allometric growth (since parts are interconnected). All the same, Huxley did not reject orthogenesis out of hand, but maintained a belief in progress all his life, with Homo sapiens as the end point, and he had since 1912 been influenced by the vitalist philosopher Henri Bergson, though in public he maintained an atheistic position on evolution.[69] Huxley's belief in progress within evolution and evolutionary humanism was shared in various forms by Dobzhansky, Mayr, Simpson and Stebbins, all of them writing about \\"the future of Mankind\\". Both Huxley and Dobzhansky admired the palaeontologist priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Huxley writing the introduction to Teilhard's 1955 book on orthogenesis, The Phenomenon of Man. This vision required evolution to be seen as the central and guiding principle of biology.[71]\\r\\nErnst Mayr's key contribution to the synthesis was Systematics and the Origin of Species, published in 1942.[72] It asserted the importance of and set out to explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of polytypic species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means.[73] Mayr emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation, where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that reproductive isolation occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of sympatric speciation believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.[40][42][74][75] Before he left Germany for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch, who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular attention to how variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.[76][77][78]\\r\\nGeorge Gaylord Simpson was responsible for showing that the modern synthesis was compatible with palaeontology in his 1944 book Tempo and Mode in Evolution. Simpson's work was crucial because so many palaeontologists had disagreed, in some cases vigorously, with the idea that natural selection was the main mechanism of evolution. It showed that the trends of linear progression (in for example the evolution of the horse) that earlier palaeontologists had used as support for neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis did not hold up under careful examination. Instead the fossil record was consistent with the irregular, branching, and non-directional pattern predicted by the modern synthesis.[40][42]\\r\\nDuring the war, Mayr edited a series of bulletins of the Committee on Common Problems of Genetics, Paleontology, and Systematics, formed in 1943, reporting on discussions of a \\"synthetic attack\\" on the interdisciplinary problems of evolution. In 1946, the committee became the Society for the Study of Evolution, with Mayr, Dobzhansky and Sewall Wright the first of the signatories. Mayr became the editor of its journal, Evolution. From Mayr and Dobzhansky's point of view, suggests the historian of science Betty Smocovitis, Darwinism was reborn, evolutionary biology was legitimised, and genetics and evolution were synthesised into a newly unified science. Everything fitted in to the new framework, except \\"heretics\\" like Richard Goldschmidt who annoyed Mayr and Dobzhansky by insisting on the possibility of speciation by macromutation, creating \\"hopeful monsters\\". The result was \\"bitter controversy\\".[51]\\r\\nThe botanist G. Ledyard Stebbins extended the synthesis to encompass botany. He described the important effects on speciation of hybridization and polyploidy in plants in his 1950 book Variation and Evolution in Plants. These permitted evolution to proceed rapidly at times, polyploidy in particular evidently being able to create new species effectively instantaneously.[40][79]\\r\\nThe modern synthesis was defined differently by its various founders, with differing numbers of basic postulates, as shown in the table.\\r\\nAfter the synthesis, evolutionary biology continued to develop with major contributions from workers including W. D. Hamilton,[84] George C. Williams,[85] E. O. Wilson,[86] Edward B. Lewis[87] and others.\\r\\nIn 1964, W. D. Hamilton published two papers on \\"The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour\\". These defined inclusive fitness as the number of offspring equivalents an individual rears, rescues or otherwise supports through its behaviour. This was contrasted with personal fitness, the number of offspring that the individual directly begets. Hamilton argued that a gene's success consisted in maximising the number of copies of itself, either by begetting them or by indirectly encouraging begetting by related individuals who shared the gene, the theory of kin selection.[84][88]\\r\\nIn 1966, George C. Williams published Adaptation and Natural Selection, outlined a gene-centred view of evolution following Hamilton's concepts, disputing the idea of evolutionary progress, and attacking the then widespread theory of group selection. Williams argued that natural selection worked by changing the frequency of alleles, and could not work at the level of groups.[89][85] Gene-centred evolution was popularised by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book The Selfish Gene and developed in his more technical writings.[90][91]\\r\\nIn 1975, E. O. Wilson published his controversial[92] book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, the subtitle alluding to the modern synthesis[86] as he attempted to bring the study of animal society into the evolutionary fold. This appeared radically new, although Wilson was following Darwin, Fisher, Dawkins and others.[86] Critics such as Gerhard Lenski noted that he was following Huxley, Simpson and Dobzhansky's approach, which Lenski considered needlessly reductive as far as human society was concerned.[93] By 2000, the proposed discipline of sociobiology had morphed into the relatively well-accepted discipline of evolutionary psychology.[86]\\r\\nIn 1977, recombinant DNA technology enabled biologists to start to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some of the regulatory genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.[87]\\r\\nIn 1982, a historical note on a series of evolutionary biology books[f] could state without qualification that evolution is the central organizing principle of biology. Smocovitis commented on this that \\"What the architects of the synthesis had worked to construct had by 1982 become a matter of fact\\", adding in a footnote that \\"the centrality of evolution had thus been rendered tacit knowledge, part of the received wisdom of the profession\\".[94]\\r\\nBy the late 20th century, however, the modern synthesis was showing its age, and fresh syntheses to remedy its defects and fill in its gaps were proposed from different directions. These have included such diverse fields as the study of society,[86] developmental biology,[49] epigenetics,[95] molecular biology, microbiology, genomics,[3] symbiogenesis, and horizontal gene transfer.[96] The physiologist Denis Noble argues that these additions render neo-Darwinism in the sense of the early 20th century's modern synthesis \\"at the least, incomplete as a theory of evolution\\",[96] and one that has been falsified by later biological research.[96]\\r\\nMichael Rose and Todd Oakley note that evolutionary biology, formerly divided and \\"Balkanized\\", has been brought together by genomics. It has in their view discarded at least five common assumptions from the modern synthesis, namely that the genome is always a well-organised set of genes; that each gene has a single function; that species are well adapted biochemically to their ecological niches; that species are the durable units of evolution, and all levels from organism to organ, cell and molecule within the species are characteristic of it; and that the design of every organism and cell is efficient. They argue that the \\"new biology\\" integrates genomics, bioinformatics, and evolutionary genetics into a general-purpose toolkit for a \\"Postmodern Synthesis\\".[97]\\r\\nIn 2007, more than half a century after the modern synthesis, Massimo Pigliucci called for an extended evolutionary synthesis to incorporate aspects of biology that had not been included or had not existed in the mid-20th century.[98][99] It revisits the relative importance of different factors, challenges assumptions made in the modern synthesis, and adds new factors[99][100] such as multilevel selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, and evolvability.[101][95][102]\\r\\nIn 2009, Darwin's 200th anniversary, the Origin of Species' 150th, and the 200th of Lamarck's \\"early evolutionary synthesis\\",[3] Philosophie Zoologique, the evolutionary biologist Eugene Koonin stated that while \\"the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair\\",[3] a new 21st century synthesis could be glimpsed. Three interlocking revolutions had, he argued, taken place in evolutionary biology: molecular, microbiological, and genomic. The molecular revolution included the neutral theory, that most mutations are neutral and that purifying selection happens more often than the positive form, and that all current life evolved from a single common ancestor. In microbiology, the synthesis has expanded to cover the prokaryotes, using ribosomal RNA to form a tree of life. Finally, genomics brought together the molecular and microbiological syntheses, noting that a molecular view shows that the tree of life is problematic. In particular, horizontal gene transfer between bacteria means that prokaryotes freely share genes, challenging Mayr's foundational definition of species. Further, horizontal gene transfer, gene duplication, and \\"momentous events\\" like endosymbiosis enable evolution to proceed in sudden jumps, ending the old gradualist-saltationist debate by showing that on this point Darwin's gradualism was wrong. The idea of progress in biology, too, is seen to be wrong, along with the modern synthesis belief in pan-adaptationism, that everything is optimally adapted: genomes plainly are not.[3] Many of these points had already been made by other researchers such as Ulrich Kutschera and Karl J. Niklas.[103]\\r\\nBiologists, alongside scholars of the history and philosophy of biology, have continued to debate the need for, and possible nature of, a replacement synthesis. For example, in 2017 Philippe Huneman and Denis M. Walsh stated in their book Challenging the Modern Synthesis that numerous theorists had pointed out that the disciplines of embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology had been omitted. They noted that all such arguments amounted to a continuing desire to replace the modern synthesis with one that united \\"all biological fields of research related to evolution, adaptation, and diversity in a single theoretical frame.\\"[104] They observed further that there are two groups of challenges to the way the modern synthesis viewed inheritance. The first is that other modes such as epigenetic inheritance, phenotypic plasticity, and the maternal effect allow new characteristics to arise and be passed on, and for the genes to catch up with the new adaptations later. The second is that all such mechanisms are part, not of an inheritance system, but a developmental system: the fundamental unit is not a discrete selfishly competing gene, but a collaborating system that works at all levels from genes and cells to organisms and cultures to guide evolution.[105]\\r\\nLooking back at the conflicting accounts of the modern synthesis, the historian Betty Smocovitis notes in her 1996 book Unifying Biology: The Evolutionary Synthesis and Evolutionary Biology that both historians and philosophers of biology have attempted to grasp its scientific meaning, but have found it \\"a moving target\\";[106] the only thing they agreed on was that it was a historical event.[106] In her words \\"by the late 1980s the notoriety of the evolutionary synthesis was recognized . . . So notorious did 'the synthesis' become, that few serious historically minded analysts would touch the subject, let alone know where to begin to sort through the interpretive mess left behind by the numerous critics and commentators\\".[107]","input":"Who proposed the modern synthetic theory of evolution?"},{"output":"14 July 1995","context":"The Torres Strait Islander Flag is an official flag of Australia, and is the flag that represents Torres Strait Islander people.

It uses antibiotic discs to test the extent to which bacteria are affected by those antibiotics. In this test, wafers containing antibiotics are placed on an agar plate where bacteria have been placed, and the plate is left to incubate. If an antibiotic stops the bacteria from growing or kills the bacteria, there will be an area around the wafer where the bacteria have not grown enough to be visible. This is called a zone of inhibition.\\r\\nThe size of this zone depends on how effective the antibiotic is at stopping the growth of the bacterium. A stronger antibiotic will create a larger zone, because a lower concentration of the antibiotic is enough to stop growth.\\r\\nThe bacteria in question is swabbed uniformly across a culture plate. A filter-paper disk, impregnated with the compound to be tested, is then placed on the surface of the agar. The compound diffuses from the filter paper into the agar. The concentration of the compound will be highest next to the disk, and will decrease as distance from the disk increases. If the compound is effective against bacteria at a certain concentration, no colonies will grow where the concentration in the agar is greater than or equal to the effective concentration. This is the zone of inhibition. This along with the rate of antibiotic diffusion are used to estimate the bacteria's sensitivity to that particular antibiotic. In general, larger zones correlate with smaller minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic for that bacteria.

Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount is the only three-point shot era player on this list who did not make a single three-point shot. From the 1986ÿ87 season through the 2007ÿ08 season, the three-point perimeter was marked at 19?ft 9?in (6.02?m) for both men's and women's college basketball.[4] On May 3, 2007, the NCAA men's basketball rules committee passed a measure to extend the distance of the men's three-point line back to 20?ft 9?in (6.32?m) (the women's line would remain the same).[4]\\r\\nAdditionally, several of the players on this list played during an era when college freshmen were ineligible to compete at the varsity level and were forced to participate on either freshman or junior varsity teams. Since freshman and junior varsity points do not count toward official NCAA records, three playersPete Maravich, Oscar Robertson and Elvin Hayesonly had three seasons to compile their totals. Larry Bird redshirted (sat out) his freshman year, and therefore, like Maravich, Robertson, and Hayes, his totals also cover only three seasons. With the added benefits of a three-point line and a full extra year of varsity eligibility, their already-historical statistics would have been much higher. Maravich, a guard from LSU, not only owns the three highest single season averages in Division?I history, but also the highest career total. Remarkably, he scored 3,667?points (over 400 more than the next closest player) in a mere 83?games. His record is generally considered unbreakable; the only player who could have potentially overtaken him as the top scorer in Division?I history is Stephen Curry of Davidson, who had scored 2,635?points through his first three seasons of college basketball. However, Curry opted to forgo his final year of NCAA eligibility and moved on to the National Basketball Association?(NBA) following his junior season in 2008ÿ09.\\r\\nFive players on this list are enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame: Pete Maravich,[5] Oscar Robertson,[6] Elvin Hayes,[7] Larry Bird[8] and David Robinson.[9]\\r\\nThe following list contains current and defunct Division I conferences' all-time scoring leaders. The \\"conference founding\\" column indicates when each respective conference first began intercollegiate athletic competition, not necessarily when they began basketball. For example, the Great West Conference was established as a football-only conference in 2004 but became an all-sports conference in 2008 (with basketball actually beginning in 2009ÿ10).[34] Also note that some of the schools on this list are no longer in the conference in which they are identified. Utah, for instance, is currently a member of the Pac-12 Conference, but when Keith Van Horn set the scoring record they were still a member of the Western Athletic Conference. Similarly, BYU is currently in the West Coast Conference, but their final four seasons in the Mountain West Conference were the years in which Jimmer Fredette played at the school and set that conference's scoring record.","input":"Who is the leading scorer in ncaa basketball?"},{"output":"the presence of endogenous metabolites undergoing chemical reactions","context":"Depurination is a chemical reaction of purine deoxyribonucleosides, deoxyadenosine and deoxyguanosine, and ribonucleosides, adenosine or guanosine, in which the -N-glycosidic bond is hydrolytically cleaved releasing a nucleic base, adenine or guanine, respectively. The second product of depurination of deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides is sugar, 2-deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. More complex compounds containing nucleoside residues, nucleotides and nucleic acids, also suffer from depurination. Deoxyribonucleosides and their derivatives are substantially more prone to depurination than their corresponding ribonucleoside counterparts. Loss of pyrimidine bases (Cytosine and Thymine) occurs by a similar mechanism, but at a substantially lower rate.\\r\\nWhen depurination occurs with DNA, it leads to the formation of apurinic site and results in an alteration of the structure. Studies estimate that as many as 5,000 purines are lost this way each day in a typical human cell.[1] In cells, one of the main causes of depurination is the presence of endogenous metabolites undergoing chemical reactions. Apurinic sites in double-stranded DNA are efficiently repaired by portions of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Depurinated bases in single-stranded DNA undergoing replication can lead to mutations, because in the absence of information from the complementary strand, BER can add an incorrect base at the apurinic site, resulting in either a transition or transversion mutation.[2]\\r\\nDepurination is known to play a major role in cancer initiation.[3]\\r\\nHydrolytic depurination is one of the principal forms of damage to ancient DNA in fossil or subfossil material, since the base remains unrepaired. This results in both loss of information (the base sequence), and difficulties in recovery and in vitro replication of the damaged molecule by the polymerase chain reaction.\\r\\nDepurination is not uncommon because purine is a good leaving group via the 9N-nitrogen (see the structure of a purine). Furthermore, the anomeric carbon is especially reactive towards nucleophilic substitution (effectively making the carbon-oxygen bond shorter, stronger and more polar, while making the carbon-purine bond longer and weaker). This makes the bond especially susceptible to hydrolysis.\\r\\nIn chemical synthesis of oligonucleotides, depurination is one of the major factors limiting the length of synthetic oligonucleotides.[4]","input":"What is the most common cause of depurination?"},{"output":"parallel flow","context":"Heat transfer is a discipline of thermal engineering that concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of thermal energy (heat) between physical systems. Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes. Engineers also consider the transfer of mass of differing chemical species, either cold or hot, to achieve heat transfer. While these mechanisms have distinct characteristics, they often occur simultaneously in the same system.\\r\\nHeat conduction, also called diffusion, is the direct microscopic exchange of kinetic energy of particles through the boundary between two systems. When an object is at a different temperature from another body or its surroundings, heat flows so that the body and the surroundings reach the same temperature, at which point they are in thermal equilibrium. Such spontaneous heat transfer always occurs from a region of high temperature to another region of lower temperature, as described by the second law of thermodynamics.\\r\\nHeat convection occurs when bulk flow of a fluid (gas or liquid) carries heat along with the flow of matter in the fluid. The flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called \\"natural convection\\". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by use of a pump, fan or other mechanical means.\\r\\nThermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or fluid). It is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat is defined in physics as the transfer of thermal energy across a well-defined boundary around a thermodynamic system. The thermodynamic free energy is the amount of work that a thermodynamic system can perform. Enthalpy is a thermodynamic potential, designated by the letter \\"H\\", that is the sum of the internal energy of the system (U) plus the product of pressure (P) and volume (V). Joule is a unit to quantify energy, work, or the amount of heat.\\r\\nHeat transfer is a process function (or path function), as opposed to functions of state; therefore, the amount of heat transferred in a thermodynamic process that changes the state of a system depends on how that process occurs, not only the net difference between the initial and final states of the process.\\r\\nThermodynamic and mechanical heat transfer is calculated with the heat transfer coefficient, the proportionality between the heat flux and the thermodynamic driving force for the flow of heat. Heat flux is a quantitative, vectorial representation of heat-flow through a surface.[2]\\r\\nIn engineering contexts, the term heat is taken as synonymous to thermal energy. This usage has its origin in the historical interpretation of heat as a fluid (Caloric) that can be transferred by various causes,[3] and that is also common in the language of laymen and everyday life.\\r\\nThe transport equations for thermal energy (Fourier's law), mechanical momentum (Newton's law for fluids), and mass transfer (Fick's laws of diffusion) are similar,[4][5] and analogies among these three transport processes have been developed to facilitate prediction of conversion from any one to the others.[5]\\r\\nThermal engineering concerns the generation, use, conversion, and exchange of heat transfer. As such, heat transfer is involved in almost every sector of the economy.[6] Heat transfer is classified into various mechanisms, such as thermal conduction, thermal convection, thermal radiation, and transfer of energy by phase changes.\\r\\nThe fundamental modes of heat transfer are:\\r\\nBy transferring matter, energyincluding thermal energyis moved by the physical transfer of a hot or cold object from one place to another.[7] This can be as simple as placing hot water in a bottle and heating a bed, or the movement of an iceberg in changing ocean currents. A practical example is thermal hydraulics.[citation needed] This can be described by the formula:\\r\\nwhere Q is heat flux (W/m2),  is density (kg/m3), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nc\\r\\n\\r\\np\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle c_{p}}\\r\\n\\r\\n is heat capacity at constant pressure (J/kg{K), T is the change in temperature (K), \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nv\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle v}\\r\\n\\r\\n is velocity (m/s).\\r\\nOn a microscopic scale, heat conduction occurs as hot, rapidly moving or vibrating atoms and molecules interact with neighboring atoms and molecules, transferring some of their energy (heat) to these neighboring particles. In other words, heat is transferred by conduction when adjacent atoms vibrate against one another, or as electrons move from one atom to another. Conduction is the most significant means of heat transfer within a solid or between solid objects in thermal contact. Fluidsespecially gasesare less conductive. Thermal contact conductance is the study of heat conduction between solid bodies in contact.[8] The process of heat transfer from one place to another place without the movement of particles is called conduction. Example: Heat transfer through Metal rods.[clarification needed] Steady state conduction (see Fourier's law) is a form of conduction that happens when the temperature difference driving the conduction is constant, so that after an equilibration time, the spatial distribution of temperatures in the conducting object does not change any further.[9] In steady state conduction, the amount of heat entering a section is equal to amount of heat coming out.[8]\\r\\nTransient conduction (see Heat equation) occurs when the temperature within an object changes as a function of time. Analysis of transient systems is more complex and often calls for the application of approximation theories or numerical analysis by computer.[8]\\r\\nThe flow of fluid may be forced by external processes, or sometimes (in gravitational fields) by buoyancy forces caused when thermal energy expands the fluid (for example in a fire plume), thus influencing its own transfer. The latter process is often called \\"natural convection\\". All convective processes also move heat partly by diffusion, as well. Another form of convection is forced convection. In this case the fluid is forced to flow by using a pump, fan or other mechanical means.\\r\\nConvective heat transfer, or convection, is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids, a process that is essentially the transfer of heat via mass transfer. Bulk motion of fluid enhances heat transfer in many physical situations, such as (for example) between a solid surface and the fluid.[10] Convection is usually the dominant form of heat transfer in liquids and gases. Although sometimes discussed as a third method of heat transfer, convection is usually used to describe the combined effects of heat conduction within the fluid (diffusion) and heat transference by bulk fluid flow streaming.[11] The process of transport by fluid streaming is known as advection, but pure advection is a term that is generally associated only with mass transport in fluids, such as advection of pebbles in a river. In the case of heat transfer in fluids, where transport by advection in a fluid is always also accompanied by transport via heat diffusion (also known as heat conduction) the process of heat convection is understood to refer to the sum of heat transport by advection and diffusion/conduction.\\r\\nFree, or natural, convection occurs when bulk fluid motions (streams and currents) are caused by buoyancy forces that result from density variations due to variations of temperature in the fluid. Forced convection is a term used when the streams and currents in the fluid are induced by external meanssuch as fans, stirrers, and pumpscreating an artificially induced convection current.[12]\\r\\nConvective cooling is sometimes described as Newton's law of cooling:\\r\\nThe rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.\\r\\nHowever, by definition, the validity of Newton's law of Cooling requires that the rate of heat loss from convection be a linear function of (\\"proportional to\\") the temperature difference that drives heat transfer, and in convective cooling this is sometimes not the case. In general, convection is not linearly dependent on temperature gradients, and in some cases is strongly nonlinear. In these cases, Newton's law does not apply.\\r\\nIn a body of fluid that is heated from underneath its container, conduction and convection can be considered to compete for dominance. If heat conduction is too great, fluid moving down by convection is heated by conduction so fast that its downward movement will be stopped due to its buoyancy, while fluid moving up by convection is cooled by conduction so fast that its driving buoyancy will diminish. On the other hand, if heat conduction is very low, a large temperature gradient may be formed and convection might be very strong.\\r\\nThe Rayleigh number (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nR\\r\\na\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle Ra}\\r\\n\\r\\n) is the product of the Grashof and Prandtl numbers. It is a measure which determines the relative strength of conduction and convection.[13]\\r\\nwhere\\r\\nThe Rayleigh number can be understood as the ratio between the rate of heat transfer by convection to the rate of heat transfer by conduction; or, equivalently, the ratio between the corresponding timescales (i.e. conduction timescale divided by convection timescale), up to a numerical factor. This can be seen as follows, where all calculations are up to numerical factors depending on the geometry of the system.\\r\\nThe buoyancy force driving the convection is roughly \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ng\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle g\\\\Delta \\\\rho L^{3}}\\r\\n\\r\\n, so the corresponding pressure is roughly \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ng\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle g\\\\Delta \\\\rho L}\\r\\n\\r\\n.

It is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws.[1]\\r\\nThermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the vacuum of space.[14]\\r\\nThermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles (protons and electrons), their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which carries energy away from the surface.\\r\\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann equation, which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum?:\\r\\nFor radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:\\r\\nwhere Q is the heat flux,  is the emissivity (unity for a black body),  is the StefanÿBoltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature (in kelvins or degrees Rankine). Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.\\r\\nRadiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power.[15] Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in concentrating solar power generation.[16] For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 solar power tower and during the day it can heat water to 285?C (545?F).[citation needed]\\r\\nPhase transition or phase change, takes place in a thermodynamic system from one phase or state of matter to another one by heat transfer. Phase change examples are the melting of ice or the boiling of water. The Mason equation explains the growth of a water droplet based on the effects of heat transport on evaporation and condensation.\\r\\nPhase transitions involve the four fundamental states of matter:\\r\\nThe boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the pressure surrounding the liquid[18][19] and the liquid evaporates resulting in an abrupt change in vapor volume.\\r\\nSaturation temperature means boiling point. The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. The liquid can be said to be saturated with thermal energy. Any addition of thermal energy results in a phase transition.\\r\\nAt standard atmospheric pressure and low temperatures, no boiling occurs and the heat transfer rate is controlled by the usual single-phase mechanisms. As the surface temperature is increased, local boiling occurs and vapor bubbles nucleate, grow into the surrounding cooler fluid, and collapse. This is sub-cooled nucleate boiling, and is a very efficient heat transfer mechanism. At high bubble generation rates, the bubbles begin to interfere and the heat flux no longer increases rapidly with surface temperature (this is the departure from nucleate boiling, or DNB).\\r\\nAt similar standard atmospheric pressure and high temperatures, the hydrodynamically-quieter regime of film boiling is reached. Heat fluxes across the stable vapor layers are low, but rise slowly with temperature. Any contact between fluid and the surface that may be seen probably leads to the extremely rapid nucleation of a fresh vapor layer (\\"spontaneous nucleation\\"). At higher temperatures still, a maximum in the heat flux is reached (the critical heat flux, or CHF).\\r\\nThe Leidenfrost Effect demonstrates how nucleate boiling slows heat transfer due to gas bubbles on the heater's surface. As mentioned, gas-phase thermal conductivity is much lower than liquid-phase thermal conductivity, so the outcome is a kind of \\"gas thermal barrier\\".\\r\\nCondensation occurs when a vapor is cooled and changes its phase to a liquid. During condensation, the latent heat of vaporization must be released. The amount of the heat is the same as that absorbed during vaporization at the same fluid pressure.[20]\\r\\nThere are several types of condensation:\\r\\nMelting is a thermal process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid. The internal energy of a substance is increased, typically with heat or pressure, resulting in a rise of its temperature to the melting point, at which the ordering of ionic or molecular entities in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state and the solid liquefies. Molten substances generally have reduced viscosity with elevated temperature; an exception to this maxim is the element sulfur, whose viscosity increases to a point due to polymerization and then decreases with higher temperatures in its molten state.[21]\\r\\nHeat transfer can be modeled in the following ways.\\r\\nClimate models study the radiant heat transfer by using quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, and ice.\\r\\nThe heat equation is an important partial differential equation that describes the distribution of heat (or variation in temperature) in a given region over time. In some cases, exact solutions of the equation are available;[22] in other cases the equation must be solved numerically using computational methods.\\r\\nLumped system analysis often reduces the complexity of the equations to one first-order linear differential equation, in which case heating and cooling are described by a simple exponential solution, often referred to as Newton's law of cooling.\\r\\nSystem analysis by the lumped capacitance model is a common approximation in transient conduction that may be used whenever heat conduction within an object is much faster than heat conduction across the boundary of the object. This is a method of approximation that reduces one aspect of the transient conduction systemthat within the objectto an equivalent steady state system. That is, the method assumes that the temperature within the object is completely uniform, although its value may be changing in time.\\r\\nIn this method, the ratio of the conductive heat resistance within the object to the convective heat transfer resistance across the object's boundary, known as the Biot number, is calculated. For small Biot numbers, the approximation of spatially uniform temperature within the object can be used: it can be presumed that heat transferred into the object has time to uniformly distribute itself, due to the lower resistance to doing so, as compared with the resistance to heat entering the object.[23]\\r\\nHeat transfer has broad application to the functioning of numerous devices and systems. Heat-transfer principles may be used to preserve, increase, or decrease temperature in a wide variety of circumstances.[citation needed] Heat transfer methods are used in numerous disciplines, such as automotive engineering, thermal management of electronic devices and systems, climate control, insulation, materials processing, and power station engineering.\\r\\nThermal insulators are materials specifically designed to reduce the flow of heat by limiting conduction, convection, or both. Thermal resistance is a heat property and the measurement by which an object or material resists to heat flow (heat per time unit or thermal resistance) to temperature difference.\\r\\nRadiance or spectral radiance are measures of the quantity of radiation that passes through or is emitted. Radiant barriers are materials that reflect radiation, and therefore reduce the flow of heat from radiation sources. Good insulators are not necessarily good radiant barriers, and vice versa. Metal, for instance, is an excellent reflector and a poor insulator.\\r\\nThe effectiveness of a radiant barrier is indicated by its reflectivity, which is the fraction of radiation reflected. A material with a high reflectivity (at a given wavelength) has a low emissivity (at that same wavelength), and vice versa. At any specific wavelength, reflectivity=1 - emissivity. An ideal radiant barrier would have a reflectivity of 1, and would therefore reflect 100 percent of incoming radiation. Vacuum flasks, or Dewars, are silvered to approach this ideal. In the vacuum of space, satellites use multi-layer insulation, which consists of many layers of aluminized (shiny) Mylar to greatly reduce radiation heat transfer and control satellite temperature.[citation needed]\\r\\nA heat engine is a system that performs the conversion of a flow of thermal energy (heat) to mechanical energy to perform mechanical work.[24][25]\\r\\nA thermocouple is a temperature-measuring device and widely used type of temperature sensor for measurement and control, and can also be used to convert heat into electric power.\\r\\nA thermoelectric cooler is a solid state electronic device that pumps (transfers) heat from one side of the device to the other when electric current is passed through it. It is based on the Peltier effect.\\r\\nA thermal diode or thermal rectifier is a device that causes heat to flow preferentially in one direction.\\r\\nA heat exchanger is used for more efficient heat transfer or to dissipate heat. Heat exchangers are widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, space heating, power generation, and chemical processing. One common example of a heat exchanger is a car's radiator, in which the hot coolant fluid is cooled by the flow of air over the radiator's surface.[citation needed]\\r\\nCommon types of heat exchanger flows include parallel flow, counter flow, and cross flow. In parallel flow, both fluids move in the same direction while transferring heat; in counter flow, the fluids move in opposite directions; and in cross flow, the fluids move at right angles to each other. Common constructions for heat exchanger include shell and tube, double pipe, extruded finned pipe, spiral fin pipe, u-tube, and stacked plate.[further explanation needed]\\r\\nA heat sink is a component that transfers heat generated within a solid material to a fluid medium, such as air or a liquid. Examples of heat sinks are the heat exchangers used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems or the radiator in a car. A heat pipe is another heat-transfer device that combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently transfer heat between two solid interfaces.\\r\\nEfficient energy use is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required in heating or cooling. In architecture, condensation and air currents can cause cosmetic or structural damage. An energy audit can help to assess the implementation of recommended corrective procedures. For instance, insulation improvements, air sealing of structural leaks or the addition of energy-efficient windows and doors.[26]\\r\\nClimate engineering consists of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management. Since the amount of carbon dioxide determines the radiative balance of Earth atmosphere, carbon dioxide removal techniques can be applied to reduce the radiative forcing. Solar radiation management is the attempt to absorb less solar radiation to offset the effects of greenhouse gases.\\r\\nThe greenhouse effect is a process by which thermal radiation from a planetary surface is absorbed by atmospheric greenhouse gases, and is re-radiated in all directions. Since part of this re-radiation is back towards the surface and the lower atmosphere, it results in an elevation of the average surface temperature above what it would be in the absence of the gases.\\r\\nThe principles of heat transfer in engineering systems can be applied to the human body in order to determine how the body transfers heat. Heat is produced in the body by the continuous metabolism of nutrients which provides energy for the systems of the body.[27] The human body must maintain a consistent internal temperature in order to maintain healthy bodily functions. Therefore, excess heat must be dissipated from the body to keep it from overheating. When a person engages in elevated levels of physical activity, the body requires additional fuel which increases the metabolic rate and the rate of heat production. The body must then use additional methods to remove the additional heat produced in order to keep the internal temperature at a healthy level.\\r\\nHeat transfer by convection is driven by the movement of fluids over the surface of the body. This convective fluid can be either a liquid or a gas. For heat transfer from the outer surface of the body, the convection mechanism is dependent on the surface area of the body, the velocity of the air, and the temperature gradient between the surface of the skin and the ambient air.[28] The normal temperature of the body is approximately 37?C. Heat transfer occurs more readily when the temperature of the surroundings is significantly less than the normal body temperature. This concept explains why a person feels cold when not enough covering is worn when exposed to a cold environment. Clothing can be considered an insulator which provides thermal resistance to heat flow over the covered portion of the body.[29] This thermal resistance causes the temperature on the surface of the clothing to be less than the temperature on the surface of the skin. This smaller temperature gradient between the surface temperature and the ambient temperature will cause a lower rate of heat transfer than if the skin were not covered.\\r\\nIn order to ensure that one portion of the body is not significantly hotter than another portion, heat must be distributed evenly through the bodily tissues. Blood flowing through blood vessels acts as a convective fluid and helps to prevent any buildup of excess heat inside the tissues of the body. This flow of blood through the vessels can be modeled as pipe flow in an engineering system. The heat carried by the blood is determined by the temperature of the surrounding tissue, the diameter of the blood vessel, the thickness of the fluid, velocity of the flow, and the heat transfer coefficient of the blood. The velocity, blood vessel diameter, and the fluid thickness can all be related with the Reynolds Number, a dimensionless number used in fluid mechanics to characterize the flow of fluids.\\r\\nLatent heat loss, also known as evaporative heat loss, accounts for a large fraction of heat loss from the body. When the core temperature of the body increases, the body triggers sweat glands in the skin to bring additional moisture to the surface of the skin. The liquid is then transformed into vapor which removes heat from the surface of the body.[30] The rate of evaporation heat loss is directly related to the vapor pressure at the skin surface and the amount of moisture present on the skin.[28] Therefore, the maximum of heat transfer will occur when the skin is completely wet. The body continuously loses water by evaporation but the most significant amount of heat loss occurs during periods of increased physical activity.\\r\\nEvaporative cooling happens when water vapor is added to the surrounding air. The energy needed to evaporate the water is taken from the air in the form of sensible heat and converted into latent heat, while the air remains at a constant enthalpy. Latent heat describes the amount of heat that is needed to evaporate the liquid; this heat comes from the liquid itself and the surrounding gas and surfaces. The greater the difference between the two temperatures, the greater the evaporative cooling effect. When the temperatures are the same, no net evaporation of water in air occurs; thus, there is no cooling effect.\\r\\nIn quantum physics, laser cooling is used to achieve temperatures of near absolute zero (?273.15?C, ?459.67?F) of atomic and molecular samples to observe unique quantum effects that can only occur at this heat level.\\r\\nMagnetic evaporative cooling is a process for lowering the temperature of a group of atoms, after pre-cooled by methods such as laser cooling. Magnetic refrigeration cools below 0.3K, by making use of the magnetocaloric effect.\\r\\nRadiative cooling is the process by which a body loses heat by radiation. Outgoing energy is an important effect in the Earth's energy budget. In the case of the Earth-atmosphere system, it refers to the process by which long-wave (infrared) radiation is emitted to balance the absorption of short-wave (visible) energy from the Sun. Convective transport of heat and evaporative transport of latent heat both remove heat from the surface and redistribute it in the atmosphere.\\r\\nThermal energy storage includes technologies for collecting and storing energy for later use. It may be employed to balance energy demand between day and nighttime. The thermal reservoir may be maintained at a temperature above or below that of the ambient environment. Applications include space heating, domestic or process hot water systems, or generating electricity.","input":"What are the different types of heat transfer?"},{"output":"6 January 2004","context":"163 above ground. 153\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa (Arabic: ??? ???????, Arabic for \\"Khalifa Tower\\"; pronounced English: /?b??rd? k??li?f?/), known as the Burj Dubai before its inauguration, is a megatall skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. With a total height of 829.8?m (2,722?ft) and a roof height (excluding antenna) of 828?m (2,717?ft), the Burj Khalifa is the tallest structure in the world since topping out in late 2008.[4][9]\\r\\nConstruction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It is designed to be the centrepiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building was originally named Burj Dubai but was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan;[3] Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest tower in the world.\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed by Adrian Smith, then of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose firm designed the Willis Tower and One World Trade Center. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifas central core houses all vertical transportation with the exception of egress stairs within each of the wings.[10] The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.\\r\\nCritical reception to Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, labour issues during construction were controversial, since the building was built primarily by migrant workers from South Asia with several allegations of mistreatment. Poor working conditions were common, a consequence of the lack of minimum wage laws in the United Arab Emirates.[11] Several instances of suicides have been reported, which is not uncommon for migrant construction workers in Dubai despite safety precautions in place.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction began on 6 January 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on 1 October 2009. The building officially opened on 4 January 2010,[2][13] and is part of the new 2?km2 (490-acre) development called Downtown Dubai at the 'First Interchange' along Sheikh Zayed Road, near Dubai's main business district. The tower's architecture and engineering were performed by Souffian AL-Jabiry of Chicago, with Adrian Smith as chief architect, and Bill Baker as chief structural engineer.[14][15] The primary contractor was Samsung C&T of South Korea.[16] The tower's construction was done by the construction division of Al Ghurair Investment group.[17][18]\\r\\nBurj Khalifa was designed to be the centrepiece of a large-scale, mixed-use development that would include 30,000 homes, nine hotels (including The Address Downtown Dubai), 3 hectares (7.4 acres) of parkland, at least 19 residential towers, the Dubai Mall, and the 12-hectare (30-acre) artificial Burj Khalifa Lake. The decision to build Burj Khalifa is reportedly based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy to one that is service and tourism based. According to officials, it is necessary for projects like Burj Khalifa to be built in the city to garner more international recognition, and hence investment. \\"He (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum) wanted to put Dubai on the map with something really sensational,\\" said Jacqui Josephson, a tourism and VIP delegations executive at Nakheel Properties.[19] The tower was known as Burj Dubai (\\"Dubai Tower\\") until its official opening in January 2010.[20] It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of USD so that Dubai could pay its debts ÿ Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.[20] In the 2000s, Dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in 2007ÿ2010, leaving large-scale projects already in construction abandoned.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception. Originally proposed as a virtual clone of the 560?m (1,837?ft) Grollo Tower proposal for Melbourne, Australia's Docklands waterfront development, the tower was redesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM).[35] Marshall Strabala, an SOM architect who worked on the project until 2006, in late 2008 said that Burj Khalifa was designed to be 808?m (2,651?ft) tall.[36]\\r\\nThe architect who designed it, Adrian Smith, felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure, so he sought and received approval to increase it to the current height.[citation needed] It has been explicitly stated that this change did not include any added floors, which is fitting with Smith's attempts to make the crown more slender.[37] Emaar properties announced on 9 June 2008 that construction of Burj Khalifa was delayed by upgraded finishes and would be completed only in September 2009.[38] An Emaar spokesperson said that \\"[t]he luxury finishes that were decided on in 2004, when the tower was initially conceptualised, is now being replaced by upgraded finishes. The design of the apartments has also been enhanced to make them more aesthetically attractive and functionally superior.\\"[39] A revised completion date of 2 December 2009 was then announced.[40] However, Burj Khalifa was opened on 4 January 2010, more than a month later.[2][13]\\r\\nThe tower was designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (SOM), who also designed the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) in Chicago and the One World Trade Center in New York City. Burj Khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the Willis Tower, invented by Fazlur Rahman Khan.[41][42] Proportionally, the design uses half the amount of steel used in the construction of the Empire State Building thanks to the tubular system.[41][43] Dr. Khans contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering. It would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work.[44] Its design is reminiscent of Frank Lloyd Wright's vision for The Illinois, a mile-high skyscraper designed for Chicago, as well as Chicago's Lake Point Tower. According to Marshall Strabala, a SOM architect who worked on the building's design team, Burj Khalifa was designed based on the 73rd floor Tower Palace Three, an all residential building in Seoul. In its early planning, Burj Khalifa was intended to be entirely residential.[36]\\r\\nSubsequent to the original design by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Emaar Properties chose Hyder Consulting to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Ltd chosen to supervise the architecture of the project.[45] Hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and MEP (mechanical, electrical and plumbing) engineering.[46] Hyder Consulting's role was to supervise construction, certify SOM's design, and be the engineer and architect of record to the UAE authorities.[45] NORR's role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during construction and design of a 6-storey addition to the Office Annex Building for architectural documentation. NORR was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the Armani Hotel included in the Tower. Emaar Properties also engaged GHD,[47] an international multidisciplinary consulting firm, to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork.\\r\\nThe design is derived from Islamic architecture.[24] As the tower rises from the flat desert base, there are 27 setbacks in a spiralling pattern, decreasing the cross section of the tower as it reaches toward the sky and creating convenient outdoor terraces. These setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices.[10] At the top, the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire. At its tallest point, the tower sways a total of 1.5?m (4.9?ft).[48]\\r\\nAs part of a study which reveals the unnecessary \\"vanity space\\" added to the top of the world's tallest buildings by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), it was revealed that without its 244-metre spire, the 828-metre Burj Khalifa would drop to a substantially smaller 585-metre height without any reduction in usable space. As the report states, the spire \\"could be a skyscraper on its own\\".[22]\\r\\nThe spire of Burj Khalifa is composed of more than 4,000 tonnes (4,400 short tons; 3,900 long tons) of structural steel. The central pinnacle pipe weighs 350 tonnes (390 short tons; 340 long tons) and has a height of 200?m (660?ft). The spire also houses communications equipment.[49]\\r\\nIn 2009, architects announced that more than 1,000 pieces of art would adorn the interiors of Burj Khalifa, while the residential lobby of Burj Khalifa would display the work of Jaume Plensa.[50]\\r\\nThe cladding system consists of 142,000?m2 (1,528,000?sq?ft) of more than 26,000 reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins.[49] The architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti-glare shield for the intense desert sun, extreme desert temperatures and strong winds. In total the glass covers more than 174,000?m2 (1,870,000?sq?ft)[citation needed].\\r\\nThe exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be 6?C (11?F) cooler than at its base.[51]\\r\\nA 304-room Armani Hotel, the first of four by Armani, occupies 15 of the lower 39 floors.[4][52] The hotel was supposed to open on 18 March 2010,[53][54] but after several delays, it finally opened to the public on 27 April 2010.[55] The corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from March onwards,[56] yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in April 2010.\\r\\nThe sky lobbies on the 43rd and 76th floors house swimming pools.[57] Floors through to 108 have 900 private residential apartments (which, according to the developer, sold out within eight hours of being on the market). An outdoor zero-entry swimming pool is located on the 76th floor of the tower. Corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors, except for a 122nd, 123rd and 124th floor where the At.mosphere restaurant, sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck is located respectively. In January 2010, it was planned that Burj Khalifa would receive its first residents from February 2010.[57][58]\\r\\nA total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators are installed.[49] The elevators have a capacity of 12 to 14 people per cabin, the fastest rising and descending at up to 10?m/s (33?ft/s) for double-deck elevators. However, the world's fastest single-deck elevator still belongs to Taipei 101 at 16.83?m/s (55.2?ft/s). Engineers had considered installing the world's first triple-deck elevators, but the final design calls for double-deck elevators.[27] The double-deck elevators are equipped with entertainment features such as LCD displays to serve visitors during their travel to the observation deck.[59] The building has 2,909 stairs from the ground floor to the 160th floor.[60]\\r\\nThe graphic design identity work for Burj Khalifa is the responsibility of Brash Brands, an independent international creative branding agency based in London. Design of the global launch events, communications, and visitors centres[61] for Burj Khalifa have also been created by Brash Brands as well as the roadshow exhibition for the Armani Residences, which are part of the Armani Hotel within Burj Khalifa, which toured Milan, London, Jeddah, Moscow and Delhi.[62]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000?L (250,000?U.S.?gal) of water per day through 100?km (62?mi) of pipes.[24][63] An additional 213?km (132?mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34?km (21?mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.[63] The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.[64]\\r\\nThe air conditioning has been provided by Voltas. The air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground.[65] At peak cooling times, the tower's cooling is equivalent to that provided by 13,000 short tons (26,000,000?lb) of melting ice in one day,[63] or about 46?MW.[clarification needed] Water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park.[24]\\r\\nTo wash the 24,348 windows, totaling 120,000?m2 (1,290,000?sq?ft) of glass, the building has three horizontal tracks which each hold a 1,500?kg (3,300?lb) bucket machine. Above level 109, and up to tier 27, traditional cradles from davits are used. The top of the building is cleaned by a crew who use ropes to descend from the top to gain access.[66][67] Under normal conditions, when all building maintenance units are operational, it takes 36 workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior fa?ade.[49][68]\\r\\nUnmanned machines will clean the top 27 additional tiers and the glass spire. The cleaning system was developed in Melbourne, Australia at a cost of A$8?million.[68] The contract for building the state-of-the-art machines was won by Australian company CoxGomyl, a manufacturer of Building Maintenance Units.[69]\\r\\nThe elevator operating chart of the Burj Khalifa\\r\\nOutside, WET Enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of Dh?800?million (US$217?million). Illuminated by 6,600 lights and 50 coloured projectors, it is 270?m (900?ft) long and shoots water 150?m (500?ft) into the air, accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary Arabic and world music. It is the world's second largest choreographed fountain.,[70] On 26 October 2008, Emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the Dubai Fountain.[71]\\r\\nAn outdoor observation deck, named At the Top, opened on 5 January 2010 on the 124th floor. At 452?m (1,483?ft), it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened.[72] Although it was surpassed in December 2011 by Cloud Top 488 on the Canton Tower, Guangzhou at 488?m (1,601?ft),[73] Burj Khalifa opened the 148th floor SKY level at 555?m (1,821?ft), once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on 15 October 2014.[28][29] This was until the Shanghai Tower opened in June 2016 with an observation deck at a height of 561 metres. The 124th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope, an augmented reality device developed by Gsmprjct of Montral, which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real-time, and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions.[74][75][76] To manage the daily rush of sightseers, visitors are able to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time and at a 75% discount on tickets purchased on the spot.[77]\\r\\nOn 8 February 2010, the observation deck was closed to the public after power-supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors, trapping a group of tourists for 45 minutes.[78][79] Despite rumours of the observation deck reopening for St. Valentine's Day (14 February),[80] it remained closed until 4 April 2010.[81][82][83] During low tides and clearness, people can see the shores of Iran from the top of the skyscraper.[84]\\r\\nBurj Khalifa is surrounded by an 11?ha (27-acre) park designed by landscape architects SWA Group.[85] Like the tower, the park's design was based on the flower of the Hymenocallis, a desert plant.[86] At the centre of the park is the water room, which is a series of pools and water jet fountains. Benches and signs incorporate images of Burj Khalifa and the Hymenocallis flower.[87]\\r\\nThe plants are watered by water collected from the building's cooling system. The system provides 68,000,000?L (15,000,000?imp?gal) annually.[87] WET Enterprises, who also developed the Dubai Fountain, developed the park's six water features.[88]\\r\\nThe following is a breakdown of floors.[49][89]\\r\\nDimetric projection with floors colour-coded by function[90]\\r\\nThe tower was constructed by Samsung C&T from South Korea, who also did work on the Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101.[91] Samsung C&T built the tower in a joint venture with Besix from Belgium and Arabtec from UAE. Turner is the Project Manager on the main construction contract.[92]\\r\\nUnder UAE law, the Contractor and the Engineer of Record, Hyder Consulting (manual structural analysis professionals which used Flash Analysis authored by Allen Wright), is jointly and severally liable for the performance of Burj Khalifa.\\r\\nThe primary structure is reinforced concrete. Putzmeister created a new, super high-pressure trailer concrete pump, the BSA 14000 SHP-D, for this project.[26] Burj Khalifa's construction used 330,000?m3 (431,600?cu?yd) of concrete and 55,000 tonnes (61,000 short tons; 54,000 long tons) of steel rebar, and construction took 22?million man-hours.[14] In May 2008 Putzmeister pumped concrete with more than 21 MPA ultimate compressive strength of gravel that would surpass the 600 meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level, and the rest is by metal columns jacketed or covered with concreted to a then world record delivery height of 606?m (1,988?ft),[26] the 156th floor. Three tower cranes were used during construction of the uppermost levels, each capable of lifting a 25-tonne load.[93] The remaining structure above is constructed of lighter steel.\\r\\nIn 2003, 33 test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure.[94] \\"Weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone\\" was found, just metres below the surface. Samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of 140 metres, finding weak to very weak rock all the way.[95] The study described the site as part of a \\"seismically active area\\".\\r\\nOver 45,000?m3 (58,900?cu?yd) of concrete, weighing more than 110,000 tonnes (120,000 short tons; 110,000 long tons) were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation, which features 192 piles; each pile is 1.5 metre diameter x 43 m long, buried more than 50?m (164?ft) deep.[27] The foundation is designed to support the total building weight of approximately 450,000 tonnes (500,000 short tons; 440,000 long tons). This weight is then divided by the compressive strength of concrete of which is 30 MPa which yield a 450 sq.meters of vertical normal effective area which then yield to a 12 meters by 12 meters dimensions.[96] A cathodic protection system is in place under the concrete to neutralize the groundwater and prevent corrosion.[49]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa is highly compartmentalised. Pressurized, air-conditioned refuge floors are located approximately every 35 floors where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire.[49][97]\\r\\nSpecial mixes of concrete are made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight; as is typical with reinforced concrete construction, each batch of concrete used was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures. CTLGroup, working for SOM, conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building.[98]\\r\\nThe consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential. It was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and Persian Gulf temperatures that can reach 50?C (122?F). To combat this problem, the concrete was not poured during the day. Instead, during the summer months, ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air is cooler and the humidity is higher. A cooler concrete mixture cures evenly throughout and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack. Any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy.\\r\\nThe unique design and engineering challenges of building Burj Khalifa have been featured in a number of television documentaries, including the Big, Bigger, Biggest series on the National Geographic and Five channels, and the Mega Builders series on the Discovery Channel.\\r\\nIn March 2009, Mohamed Ali Alabbar, chairman of the project's developer, Emaar Properties, said office space pricing at Burj Khalifa reached US$4,000 per sq ft (over US$43,000 per m2) and the Armani Residences, also in Burj Khalifa, sold for US$3,500 per sq ft (over US$37,500 per m2).[108] He estimated the total cost for the project to be about US$1.5?billion.[3]\\r\\nThe project's completion coincided with the global financial crisis of 2007ÿ2012, and with vast overbuilding in the country; this led to high vacancies and foreclosures.[109] With Dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions, the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil-rich neighbor Abu Dhabi. Subsequently, in a surprise move at its opening ceremony, the tower was renamed Burj Khalifa, said to honour the UAE President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his crucial support.[9][110]\\r\\nBecause of the slumping demand in Dubai's property market, the rents in the Burj Khalifa plummeted 40% some ten months after its opening. Out of 900 apartments in the tower, 825 were still empty at that time.[111][112] However, over the next two and a half years, overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space in Burj Khalifa.[113] By October 2012, Emaar reported that around 80% of the apartments were occupied.[114]\\r\\nThe ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on Burj Park Island and on smaller screens elsewhere. Hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene.[115] In addition to the media presence, 6,000 guests were expected.[116]\\r\\nThe opening of Burj Khalifa was held on 4 January 2010.[117] The ceremony featured a display of 10,000 fireworks, light beams projected on and around the tower, and further sound, light and water effects.[115] The celebratory lighting was designed by UK lighting designers Speirs and Major Associates.[118] Using the 868 powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the fa?ade and spire of the tower, different lighting sequences were choreographed, together with more than 50 different combinations of other effects.\\r\\nA short film about Burj Khalifa and Dubai in general was followed by a fireworks and light show.[115] The first part of the show was based on a desert flower theme and included fireworks, lights, and sounds. The second segment told the story of the tower's construction using 300 projectors to generate an image of the tower. The final segment used fireworks and lights to illuminate the tower.[115]\\r\\nIn June 2010, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of the 2010 \\"Best Tall Building Middle East & Africa\\" award by the CTBUH.[119] On 28 September 2010 Burj Khalifa won the award for best project of the year at the Middle East Architect Awards 2010.[120] CTBUH Awards Chair Gordon Gill, of Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture said:\\r\\nWe are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed. 'Building of the Century' was thought a more appropriate title for it.[121]\\r\\nBesides these awards, Burj Khalifa was the recipient of following awards.[122][123]\\r\\nThe building has been used by several experienced BASE jumpers for both authorised and unauthorised BASE jumping:\\r\\nOn 28 March 2011, Alain \\"Spiderman\\" Robert scaled the outside of Burj Khalifa. The climb to the top of the spire took six hours. To comply with UAE safety laws, Robert, who usually climbs in free solo style, used a rope and harness for the climb.[131]\\r\\nWithin 17 months of the building's official opening, a man described as \\"an Asian in his mid-30s\\" who worked at one of the companies in the tower, died by suicide on 10 May 2011 by jumping from the 147th floor. He fell 39 floors, landing on a deck on the 108th floor. Dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide, reporting that \\"[they] also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave.\\"[132]\\r\\nThe Daily Mail reported that on 16 November 2014, Laura Vanessa Nunes, a Portuguese national who was in Dubai on a tourist visa, fell to her death from Burj Khalifa's \\"At the Top\\" observation deck on the 148th floor.[133] However, on 18 May 2015, Dubai police disputed the report made by the Daily Mail on this incident and said that this incident took place in Jumeirah Lakes Towers.[134] Coroner's report states Laura's body was found on the third floor of the Burj Khalifa[135]\\r\\nAt the higher floors of the Burj, people can still see the sun for a couple of minutes after it has set on the ground. This has led Dubai clerics to rule that those living above the 80th floor should wait 2 additional minutes to break their Ramadan fast, and those living above the 150th floor, 3 minutes.[136]\\r\\nThe Burj Khalifa was built primarily by workers from South Asia and East Asia.[149][150] This is generally because the current generation of UAE locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment.[151][152] On 17 June 2008, there were 7,500 skilled workers employed at the construction site.[38] Press reports indicated in 2006 that skilled carpenters at the site earned S4.34 a day, and labourers earned S2.84.[149] According to a BBC investigation and a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, the workers were housed in abysmal conditions, and worked long hours for low pay.[153][154][155] During the construction of Burj Khalifa, only one construction-related death was reported.[156] However, workplace injuries and fatalities in the UAE are \\"poorly documented\\", according to HRW.[153]\\r\\nOn 21 March 2006, about 2,500 workers, who were upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts, protested and triggered a riot, damaging cars, offices, computers and construction equipment.[149] A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused almost S500,000 in damage.[149] Most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work.[149]","input":"When did the construction of burj khalifa start?"},{"output":"20ÿ30 trillion red blood cells","context":"Red blood cells-- also known as RBCs, red cells,[1] red blood corpuscles, haematids, erythroid cells or erythrocytes (from Greek erythros for \\"red\\" and kytos for \\"hollow vessel\\", with -cyte translated as \\"cell\\" in modern usage), are the most common type of blood cell and the vertebrate's principal means of delivering oxygen (O2) to the body tissuesvia blood flow through the circulatory system.[2] RBCs take up oxygen in the lungs, or gills of fish, and release it into tissues while squeezing through the body's capillaries.\\r\\nThe cytoplasm of erythrocytes is rich in hemoglobin, an iron-containing biomolecule that can bind oxygen and is responsible for the red color of the cells. The cell membrane is composed of proteins and lipids, and this structure provides properties essential for physiological cell function such as deformability and stability while traversing the circulatory system and specifically the capillary network.\\r\\nIn humans, mature red blood cells are flexible and oval biconcave disks. They lack a cell nucleus and most organelles, in order to accommodate maximum space for hemoglobin; they can be viewed as sacks of hemoglobin, with a plasma membrane as the sack. Approximately 2.4 million new erythrocytes are produced per second in human adults.[3] The cells develop in the bone marrow and circulate for about 100ÿ120 days in the body before their components are recycled by macrophages. Each circulation takes about 60 seconds (one minute).[4] Approximately a quarter of the cells in the human body are red blood cells.[5][6] Nearly half of the blood's volume (40% to 45%) is red blood cells.\\r\\nPacked red blood cells (pRBC) are red blood cells that have been donated, processed, and stored in a blood bank for blood transfusion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all vertebrates, including all mammals and humans, have red blood cells. Red blood cells are cells present in blood in order to transport oxygen. The only known vertebrates without red blood cells are the crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae); they live in very oxygen-rich cold water and transport oxygen freely dissolved in their blood.[8] While they no longer use hemoglobin, remnants of hemoglobin genes can be found in their genome.[9]\\r\\nVertebrate red blood cells consist mainly of hemoglobin, a complex metalloprotein containing heme groups whose iron atoms temporarily bind to oxygen molecules (O2) in the lungs or gills and release them throughout the body. Oxygen can easily diffuse through the red blood cell's cell membrane. Hemoglobin in the red blood cells also carries some of the waste product carbon dioxide back from the tissues; most waste carbon dioxide, however, is transported back to the pulmonary capillaries of the lungs as bicarbonate (HCO3?) dissolved in the blood plasma. Myoglobin, a compound related to hemoglobin, acts to store oxygen in muscle cells.[10]\\r\\nThe color of red blood cells is due to the heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color depending on the state of the hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting deoxyhemoglobin is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin.[11] Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.\\r\\nHaving oxygen-carrying proteins inside specialized cells (as opposed to oxygen carriers being dissolved in body fluid) was an important step in the evolution of vertebrates as it allows for less viscous blood, higher concentrations of oxygen, and better diffusion of oxygen from the blood to the tissues. The size of red blood cells varies widely among vertebrate species; red blood cell width is on average about 25% larger than capillary diameter, and it has been hypothesized that this improves the oxygen transfer from red blood cells to tissues.[12]\\r\\nThe red blood cells of mammals are typically shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim on the edge of the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the flow properties of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels.[13] Moreover, this shape allows for a high surface-area-to-volume (SA/V) ratio to facilitate diffusion of gases.[14] However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm.[7][15] Overall, mammalian red blood cells are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.[16]\\r\\nRed blood cells in mammals are unique amongst vertebrates as they do not have nuclei when mature. Red blood cells of mammals cells have nuclei during early phases of erythropoiesis, but extrude them during development as they mature in order to provide more space for hemoglobin. The red blood cells without nuclei, called reticulocytes, go on to lose all other cellular organelles such as their mitochondria, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.\\r\\nThe spleen acts as a reservoir of red blood cells, but this effect is somewhat limited in humans. In some other mammals such as dogs and horses, the spleen sequesters large numbers of red blood cells which are dumped into the blood during times of exertion stress, yielding a higher oxygen transport capacity.\\r\\nA typical human red blood cell has a disk diameter of approximately 6.2ÿ8.2 m[17] and a thickness at the thickest point of 2ÿ2.5?m and a minimum thickness in the centre of 0.8ÿ1?m, being much smaller than most other human cells. These cells have an average volume of about 90 fL[18] with a surface of about 136 m2, and can swell up to a sphere shape containing 150 fL, without membrane distension.\\r\\nAdult humans have roughly 20ÿ30 trillion red blood cells at any given time, constituting approximately 70% of all cells by number.[19] Women have about 4ÿ5 million red blood cells per microliter (cubic millimeter) of blood and men about 5ÿ6 million; people living at high altitudes with low oxygen tension will have more. Red blood cells are thus much more common than the other blood particles: there are about 4,000ÿ11,000 white blood cells and about 150,000ÿ400,000 platelets per microliter.\\r\\nHuman red blood cells take on average 60 seconds to complete one cycle of circulation.[4][6][20]\\r\\nThe blood's red color is due to the spectral properties of the hemic iron ions in hemoglobin. Each human red blood cell contains approximately 270 million[citation needed] of these hemoglobin molecules. Each hemoglobin molecule carries four heme groups; hemoglobin constitutes about a third of the total cell volume. Hemoglobin is responsible for the transport of more than 98% of the oxygen in the body (the remaining oxygen is carried dissolved in the blood plasma). The red blood cells of an average adult human male store collectively about 2.5 grams of iron, representing about 65% of the total iron contained in the body.[21][22]\\r\\nRed blood cells in mammals anucleate when mature, meaning that they lack a cell nucleus. In comparison, the red blood cells of other vertebrates have nuclei; the only known exceptions are salamanders of the genus Batrachoseps and fish of the genus Maurolicus.[23][24]\\r\\nThe elimination of the nucleus in vertebrate red blood cells has been offered as an explanation for the subsequent accumulation of non-coding DNA in the genome.[25] The argument runs as follows: Efficient gas transport requires red blood cells to pass through very narrow capillaries, and this constrains their size. In the absence of nuclear elimination, the accumulation of repeat sequences is constrained by the volume occupied by the nucleus, which increases with genome size.\\r\\nNucleated red blood cells in mammals consist of two forms: normoblasts, which are normal erythropoietic precursors to mature red blood cells, and megaloblasts, which are abnormally large precursors that occur in megaloblastic anemias.\\r\\nRed blood cells are deformable, flexible, are able to adhere to other cells, and are able to interface with immune cells. Their membrane plays many roles in this. These functions are highly dependent on the membrane composition. The red blood cell membrane is composed of 3 layers: the glycocalyx on the exterior, which is rich in carbohydrates; the lipid bilayer which contains many transmembrane proteins, besides its lipidic main constituents; and the membrane skeleton, a structural network of proteins located on the inner surface of the lipid bilayer. Half of the membrane mass in human and most mammalian red blood cells are proteins. The other half are lipids, namely phospholipids and cholesterol.[26]\\r\\nThe red blood cell cell membrane comprises a typical lipid bilayer, similar to what can be found in virtually all human cells. Simply put, this lipid bilayer is composed of cholesterol and phospholipids in equal proportions by weight. The lipid composition is important as it defines many physical properties such as membrane permeability and fluidity. Additionally, the activity of many membrane proteins is regulated by interactions with lipids in the bilayer.\\r\\nUnlike cholesterol, which is evenly distributed between the inner and outer leaflets, the 5 major phospholipids are asymmetrically disposed, as shown below:\\r\\nOuter monolayer\\r\\nInner monolayer\\r\\nThis asymmetric phospholipid distribution among the bilayer is the result of the function of several energy-dependent and energy-independent phospholipid transport proteins. Proteins called Flippases move phospholipids from the outer to the inner monolayer, while others called floppases do the opposite operation, against a concentration gradient in an energy dependent manner. Additionally, there are also scramblase proteins that move phospholipids in both directions at the same time, down their concentration gradients in an energy independent manner. There is still considerable debate ongoing regarding the identity of these membrane maintenance proteins in the red cell membrane.\\r\\nThe maintenance of an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in the bilayer (such as an exclusive localization of PS and PIs in the inner monolayer) is critical for the cell integrity and function due to several reasons:\\r\\nThe presence of specialized structures named \\"lipid rafts\\" in the red blood cell membrane have been described by recent studies. These are structures enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids associated with specific membrane proteins, namely flotillins, stomatins (band 7), G-proteins, and -adrenergic receptors. Lipid rafts that have been implicated in cell signaling events in nonerythroid cells have been shown in erythroid cells to mediate 2-adregenic receptor signaling and increase cAMP levels, and thus regulating entry of malarial parasites into normal red cells.[27][28]\\r\\nThe proteins of the membrane skeleton are responsible for the deformability, flexibility and durability of the red blood cell, enabling it to squeeze through capillaries less than half the diameter of the red blood cell (7ÿ8 m) and recovering the discoid shape as soon as these cells stop receiving compressive forces, in a similar fashion to an object made of rubber.\\r\\nThere are currently more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can exist in a few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, as well as other currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis, hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.[26][27]\\r\\nThe red blood cell membrane proteins organized according to their function:\\r\\nTransport\\r\\nCell adhesion\\r\\nStructural role ÿ The following membrane proteins establish linkages with skeletal proteins and may play an important role in regulating cohesion between the lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, likely enabling the red cell to maintain its favorable membrane surface area by preventing the membrane from collapsing (vesiculating).\\r\\n[26][27]\\r\\nThe zeta potential is an electrochemical property of cell surfaces that is determined by the net electrical charge of molecules exposed at the surface of cell membranes of the cell. The normal zeta potential of the red blood cell is ?15.7?millivolts (mV).[32] Much of this potential appears to be contributed by the exposed sialic acid residues in the membrane: their removal results in zeta potential of ?6.06?mV.\\r\\nWhen red blood cells undergo shear stress in constricted vessels, they release ATP, which causes the vessel walls to relax and dilate so as to promote normal blood flow.[33]\\r\\nWhen their hemoglobin molecules are deoxygenated, red blood cells release S-nitrosothiols, which also act to dilate blood vessels,[34] thus directing more blood to areas of the body depleted of oxygen.\\r\\nRed blood cells can also synthesize nitric oxide enzymatically, using L-arginine as substrate, as do endothelial cells.[35] Exposure of red blood cells to physiological levels of shear stress activates nitric oxide synthase and export of nitric oxide,[36] which may contribute to the regulation of vascular tonus.\\r\\nRed blood cells can also produce hydrogen sulfide, a signalling gas that acts to relax vessel walls. It is believed that the cardioprotective effects of garlic are due to red blood cells converting its sulfur compounds into hydrogen sulfide.[37]\\r\\nRed blood cells also play a part in the body's immune response: when lysed by pathogens such as bacteria, their hemoglobin releases free radicals, which break down the pathogen's cell wall and membrane, killing it.[38][39]\\r\\nAs a result of not containing mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the energy carrier ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate.[40][41] Furthermore, the pentose phosphate pathway plays an important role in red blood cells; see glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency for more.\\r\\nAs red blood cells contain no nucleus, protein biosynthesis is currently assumed to be absent in these cells.\\r\\nBecause of the lack of nuclei and organelles, mature red blood cells do not contain DNA and cannot synthesize any RNA, and consequently cannot divide and have limited repair capabilities.[42] The inability to carry out protein synthesis means that no virus can evolve to target mammalian red blood cells.[43] However, infection with parvoviruses (such as human parvovirus B19) can affect erythroid precursors, as recognized by the presence of giant pronormoblasts with viral particles and inclusion bodies, thus temporarily depleting the blood of reticulocytes and causing anemia.[44]\\r\\nHuman red blood cells are produced through a process named erythropoiesis, developing from committed stem cells to mature red blood cells in about 7 days. When matured, in a healthy individual these cells live in blood circulation for about 100 to 120 days (and 80 to 90 days in a full term infant).[45] At the end of their lifespan, they are removed from circulation. In many chronic diseases, the lifespan of the red blood cells is reduced.\\r\\nErythropoiesis is the process by which new red blood cells are produced; it lasts about 7 days. Through this process red blood cells are continuously produced in the red bone marrow of large bones. (In the embryo, the liver is the main site of red blood cell production.) The production can be stimulated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), synthesised by the kidney. Just before and after leaving the bone marrow, the developing cells are known as reticulocytes; these constitute about 1% of circulating red blood cells.\\r\\nThe functional lifetime of an red blood cell is about 100ÿ120 days, during which time the red blood cells are continually moved by the blood flow push (in arteries), pull (in veins) and a combination of the two as they squeeze through microvessels such as capillaries. They are also recycled in the bone marrow.[46]\\r\\nThe aging red blood cell undergoes changes in its plasma membrane, making it susceptible to selective recognition by macrophages and subsequent phagocytosis in the mononuclear phagocyte system (spleen, liver and lymph nodes), thus removing old and defective cells and continually purging the blood. This process is termed eryptosis, red blood cell programmed cell death.[47] This process normally occurs at the same rate of production by erythropoiesis, balancing the total circulating red blood cell count. Eryptosis is increased in a wide variety of diseases including sepsis, haemolytic uremic syndrome, malaria, sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, phosphate depletion, iron deficiency and Wilson's disease. Eryptosis can be elicited by osmotic shock, oxidative stress, energy depletion as well as a wide variety of endogenous mediators and xenobiotics. Excessive eryptosis is observed in red blood cells lacking the cGMP-dependent protein kinase type I or the AMP-activated protein kinase AMPK. Inhibitors of eryptosis include erythropoietin, nitric oxide, catecholamines and high concentrations of urea.\\r\\nMuch of the resulting breakdown products are recirculated in the body. The heme constituent of hemoglobin are broken down into iron (Fe3+) and biliverdin. The biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin, which is released into the plasma and recirculated to the liver bound to albumin. The iron is released into the plasma to be recirculated by a carrier protein called transferrin. Almost all red blood cells are removed in this manner from the circulation before they are old enough to hemolyze. Hemolyzed hemoglobin is bound to a protein in plasma called haptoglobin, which is not excreted by the kidney.[48]\\r\\nBlood diseases involving the red blood cells include:\\r\\nRed blood cells may be given as part of a blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the recipient at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of blood-borne diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious Blood-borne diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.\\r\\nBlood is often transfused when there is known anaemia, active bleeding, or when there is an expectation of serious blood loss, such as prior to an operation. Before blood is given, a small sample of the recipient's blood is tested with the transfusion in a process known as cross-matching. In addition to the transmission of infection, certain types of transfusion reaction.\\r\\nIn 2008 it was reported that human embryonic stem cells had been successfully coaxed into becoming red blood cells in the lab. The difficult step was to induce the cells to eject their nucleus; this was achieved by growing the cells on stromal cells from the bone marrow. It is hoped that these artificial red blood cells can eventually be used for blood transfusions.[50]\\r\\nSeveral blood tests involve red blood cells. These include a RBC count (the number of red blood cells per volume of blood), calculation of the hematocrit (percentage of blood volume occupied by red blood cells), and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The blood type needs to be determined to prepare for a blood transfusion or an organ transplantation.\\r\\nMany diseases involving red blood cells are diagnosed with a blood film (or peripheral blood smear), where a thin layer of blood is smeared on a microscope slide. This may reveal abnormalities of red blood cell shape and form. When red blood cells sometimes occur as a stack, flat side next to flat side. This is known as rouleaux formation, and it occurs more often if the levels of certain serum proteins are elevated, as for instance during inflammation.\\r\\nRed blood cells can be obtained from whole blood by centrifugation, which separates the cells from the blood plasma in a process known as blood fractionation. Packed red blood cells, which are made in this way from whole blood with the plasma removed, are used in transfusion medicine.[51] During plasma donation, the red blood cells are pumped back into the body right away and only the plasma is collected.\\r\\nSome athletes have tried to improve their performance by blood doping: first about 1?litre of their blood is extracted, then the red blood cells are isolated, frozen and stored, to be reinjected shortly before the competition. (Red blood cells can be conserved for 5 weeks at ?79?C or ?110?F) This practice is hard to detect but may endanger the human cardiovascular system which is not equipped to deal with blood of the resulting higher viscosity. Another method of blood doping involves injection with erythropoietin in order to stimulate production of red blood cells. Both practices are banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\\r\\nThe first person to describe red blood cells was the young Dutch biologist Jan Swammerdam, who had used an early microscope in 1658 to study the blood of a frog.[52] Unaware of this work, Anton van Leeuwenhoek provided another microscopic description in 1674, this time providing a more precise description of red blood cells, even approximating their size, \\"25,000 times smaller than a fine grain of sand\\".\\r\\nIn 1901, Karl Landsteiner published his discovery of the three main blood groupsA, B, and C (which he later renamed to O). Landsteiner described the regular patterns in which reactions occurred when serum was mixed with red blood cells, thus identifying compatible and conflicting combinations between these blood groups. A year later Alfred von Decastello and Adriano Sturli, two colleagues of Landsteiner, identified a fourth blood groupAB.\\r\\nIn 1959, by use of X-ray crystallography, Dr. Max Perutz was able to unravel the structure of hemoglobin, the red blood cell protein that carries oxygen.[53]\\r\\nThe oldest intact red blood cells ever discovered were found in ?tzi the Iceman, a natural mummy of a man who died around 3255 BCE. These cells were discovered in May 2012.[54]","input":"How many red blood cells are in the body?"},{"output":"the Isthmus of Panama","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boundaries between the continents of Earth are generally a matter of geographical convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of continents is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the Americas and Afro-Eurasia are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an island cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three overland boundaries subject to definition:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the Suez and Panama canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the isthmus between the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European and African mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, Morocco and the European portion of Spain are separated by only 13 kilometres (8.1 miles).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the Azores is 1,368?km (850?mi) from Europe and 1,507?km (936?mi) from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the Canary and Madeira islands off the Atlantic coast of Morocco are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only 100?km (62?mi) from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is 520?km (320?mi) from Africa and 1,000?km (620?mi) from Europe).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mediterranean island nation of Malta is approximately 81?km (50?mi) from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the 288?km (179?mi) distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of Lampedusa is 207?km (129?mi) from Sicily while just 127?km (79?mi) from the African coast;  similarly, Pantelleria is 100?km (62?mi) from Sicily and just 71?km (44?mi) from the African coast.  All of these Mediterranean islands are actually located on the African plate, and may be considered part of the continent of Africa.[2][3] However, for political and historical reasons, maps generally display them as part of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early Greek geographers.\\r\\nIn the modern sense of the term \\"continent\\", Eurasia is more readily identifiable as a \\"continent\\", and Europe has occasionally been described as a subcontinent of Eurasia.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threefold division of the Old World into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to Greek geographers such as Anaximander and Hecataeus. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC.[5]\\r\\nAs geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the Hellenistic period,[6] this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius,[7] Strabo[8] and Ptolemy.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of Eurasia into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the Turkish Straits, the Black Sea, the Kerch Strait,  the Sea of Azov and the Don (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at Kalach-na-Donu (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the VolgaÿDon Canal), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilip Johan von Strahlenberg in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the Volga, following the Volga north until the Samara Bend, along Obshchy Syrt (the drainage divide between Volga and Ural) and then north along Ural Mountains.[10][11] The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The 1745 atlas published by the Russian Academy of Sciences has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as Serafimovich before cutting north towards Arkhangelsk, while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as John Cary followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the KumaÿManych Depression was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, Peter Simon Pallas, as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,[11][12] and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the VolgaÿDon Canal and the Volga, the other following the KumaÿManych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the Greater Caucasus watershed to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a \\"controversy\\" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with Douglas Freshfield advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the \\"best possible\\", citing support from various \\"modern geographers\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Russia and the Soviet Union, the boundary along the KumaÿManych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.[14] In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from Baydaratskaya Bay, on the Kara Sea, along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the Ural River until the Mugodzhar Hills, and then the Emba River; and KumaÿManych Depression,[15] thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.[16] However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest[17] and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the KumaÿManych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the Aegean Sea, the Dardanelles-Sea of Marmara-Bosphorus (together known as the Turkish Straits), the Black Sea, along the watershed of the Greater Caucasus, the northwestern portion of the Caspian Sea and along the Ural River and Ural Mountains to the Kara Sea, as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the National Geographic Society and as described in the World Factbook.[20][21] According to this definition, Georgia and Azerbaijan both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThough most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to Southwest or West Asia,[23] no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, Georgia and to a lesser extent Armenia and Azerbaijan are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with Iranian Azerbaijan as well as with the Turkic countries of Central Asia.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Turkish city Istanbul lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. Russia and Turkey are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of imperial conquests in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with imperial conquests in Europe. Kazakhstan is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its West Kazakhstan and Atyrau provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Ural River delineation is the only segment not to follow a major mountain range or wide water body, both of which often truly separate populations. However, the Ural River is the most common division used by authorities,[20][25][26] is the most prominent natural feature in the region, and is the \\"most satisfactory of those (options) proposed\\"[27] which include the Emba River, a much smaller stream cutting further into Central Asian Kazakhstan.  The Ural River bridge in Orenburg is even labeled with permanent monuments carved with the word \\"Europe\\" on one side, \\"Asia\\" on the other.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe KumaÿManych Depression (more precisely, the Manych River, the KumaÿManych Canal and the Kuma River) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.[29] This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  Stavropol, Krasnodar, and even areas just south of Rostov-on-Don in Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD):[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to UNSD, the aforementioned \\"assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories\\".[31] Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other United Nations organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization  and UNESCO include both countries in Europe.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Council of Europe includes the Eurasian countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Russia and Turkey.  It notes that \\"two Council of Europe member States, Turkey and Russia, belong geographically to both Europe and Asia and are therefore Eurasian. Strictly speaking, the three South Caucasus States, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are located in Asia, yet their membership of political Europe is no longer in doubt.\\" [34]\\r\\n\\r\\nCyprus is an island of the Mediterranean located close to Asia Minor, so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the Middle East, as in the World Factbook and the United Nations geoscheme, but the Republic of Cyprus was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek North Aegean Islands and the Dodecanese lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope and North America are separated by the North Atlantic.\\r\\nIn terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between Greenland and Iceland. The Norwegian islands of Jan Mayen and Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the Azores are protrusions of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the North American Plate.  (Definitions of \\"continents\\" are a physical and cultural construct dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of plate tectonics; thus, defining a \\"continent\\" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of geology.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geographical notion of a continent stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.[35]\\r\\nNevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.\\r\\nThis most notably includes the British Isles (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the island states of Iceland and Malta.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussia's Vaygach Island and Novaya Zemlya extend northward from the northern end of the Ural Mountains and are a continuation of that chain into the Arctic Ocean. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the Kara Sea. The Russian Arctic archipelago of Franz Josef Land farther north is also associated with Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope ends in the west at the Atlantic Ocean, although Iceland and the Azores archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian Svalbard archipelago in the Arctic Ocean. Greenland is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically in Greco-Roman geography, \\"Africa\\" meant Ancient Libya, and its eastern extent was taken to be around Marmarica, at the Catabathmus Magnus, placing Egypt in Asia entirely.\\r\\nThe idea of Egypt being an \\"African\\" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;[citation needed] the term  Africa was classically reserved for what is now known as the Maghreb, to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the exploration of Africa the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's \\"natural\\" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, William George Browne still titled his travelogue Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria. Similarly, James Bruce in 1835 published Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia. On the other hand,\\r\\nas early as 1670  John Ogilby under the title Africa published \\"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, ?thiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the Isthmus of Suez, the narrowest gap between the Mediterranean and Gulf of Suez, the route today followed by the Suez Canal. This makes the Sinai Peninsula geographically Asian, and Egypt a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an African country entirely and not partly Asian.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when discussing the geopolitical region of the Middle East and North Africa, Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the Middle East, while Egypt's western neighbor Libya is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the Maghreb. However, they are both members of the Arab League as well as the African Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seychelles, Mauritius, and Comoros are island nations in the Indian Ocean associated with Africa. The island of Socotra may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of Yemen, an Asian country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe border between North America and South America is at some point on the Isthmus of Panama. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the Darin Mountains watershed divide along the Colombia-Panama border where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within North America and/or Central America.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOften most of the Caribbean islands are considered part of North America, but Aruba, Bonaire, Cura?ao and Trinidad and Tobago lie on the continental shelf of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan Isla Aves and the Colombian San Andrs and Providencia lie on the North American shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bering Strait and Bering Sea separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the Diomede Islands in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The Aleutian Islands are an island chain extending westward from the Alaska Peninsula toward Russia's Komandorski Islands and Kamchatka Peninsula.

Despite its commitment to NPT, there are reports indicating that Muammar Gaddafi of Libya either made unsuccessful attempts to build or entered in an agreement to purchase a nuclear weapon from nuclear-armed nations. In the 1970sÿ80s, Gaddafi made numerous attempts to accelerate and push forward his ambitions for an active nuclear weapons program, using the nuclear black market sources. However, after the end of the Cold War in 1991, Gaddafi sought to resolve its nuclear crises with the United States aiming to uplift the sanctions against Libya, finally agreeing to authorize rolling back Libya's weapons of mass destruction program on December 2003.\\r\\nAs of 2013, over 800 tons of chemical weapons ingredients remained to be destroyed.[2] In February 2014, the new Libyan government announced that it had finished destroying old Libya's entire remaining stockpile of chemical weapons. Full destruction of chemical weapons ingredients was scheduled to be completed by 2016.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Clinton administration diplomat Martin Indyk, Muammar Gaddafi sought more respectability as early as the start of Bill Clinton's Presidency, in the early 1990s.[4] According to an article written by Indyk in 2004, by the 1990s, Gaddafi gave up on supporting various Pan-Arab and African movements and instead began focusing on getting sanctions on Libya removed.[4] Indyk stated that Gaddafi offered to give up his weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and open his facilities to inspection in 1999 in (then-)secret talks with the Bill Clinton administration.[4] According to Gaddafi's former Foreign Minister, Abdel Rahman Shalgham, the event which ultimately caused Gaddafi to give up his WMDs and nuclear weapons program was a reported 2001 message from U.S. President George W. Bush which told Gaddafi that either you get rid of your weapons of mass destruction or [the United States] will personally destroy them and destroy everything with no discussion.[5] Libyan officials began to meet covertly with British, Russian, and U.S. officials to officially dismantle the program. In March 2003, days before the invasion of Iraq, Gaddafi's personal envoys contacted U.S. President George W. Bush, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair about Libya's willingness to dismantle its nuclear program.[6] Subsequently, at Gaddafi's direction, Libyan officials provided British, Russian, and U.S. diplomats with documentation and additional details on Libya's chemical, biological, nuclear, and ballistic missile activities. Libya reportedly allowed Russian, U.S., and British officials to visit 10 previously secret sites and dozens of Libyan laboratories and military factories to search for evidence of nuclear fuel cycle-related activities, and for chemical and missile programs.\\r\\nIn October 2003, U.S. intelligence agencies raided a cargo ship and seized a consignment of centrifuge-related equipment bound for Libya in a northern Mediterranean port.[7] The U.S. investigations revealed that many of these components were manufactured by the Scomi Precision Engineering facility in Malaysia and were produced under the technical guidance of Dr. A.Q. Khan and various nationals from the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland.[7] After the news became public, Libyan nuclear ambitions were cooled and demoralized.[7]\\r\\nThe 2001 September 11 attacks in the United States were prudently denounced by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.[8] Following the U.S. military response in the Afghanistan war theater, Gaddafi increasingly sought to normalize relations with the United States, initially focusing on the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Libya. On 19 December 2003, Gaddafi made a surprise announcement of his intention to dismantle Libya's WMD programs.[9] Following the announcement, Libya agreed to the destruction of its chemical weapons and its nuclear and biological weapon programs.[10] The Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials were quoted \\"Libya had bought nuclear components from various black market dealers\\", and provided the various designs of centrifuges to U.S. officials and gave the name of its suppliers.\\r\\nAmong the list of suppliers included the revealing role of A.Q. Khan, a notable and famed scientist of Pakistan. Events in Libya led to the debriefing of A.Q. Khan in 2004 by the Government of Pakistan while the United States, aided by IAEA and Interpol, apprehended the former Libyan nuclear program's head and Swiss, Friedrich Tinner in Switzerland. On 22 January 2004, U.S. military transport planes carried around 55,000 pounds (25,000?kg) of documents and equipments related to Libya's nuclear and ballistic missile programs to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. On March 2004, over 1,000 additional centrifuge and missile parts were shipped out of Libya.\\r\\nAt the time of Libya's nuclear disarmament, its nuclear program was in the very initial stages of development.[11] The Director-General of the IAEA Mohamed ElBaradei stated to the media that it was his \\"gut feeling\\" that Libya was three to seven years from successfully building a nuclear weapon.[11]\\r\\nLibya's decision was praised by many in the West but criticized by many in the Arab world.[5] In 2004, Paula DeSutter, the-then United States Assistant Secretary of State for Verification and Compliance stated that we want to have lessons learned from [Libya's disarmament] because we want Libya to be a model for other countries.[5] Some prominent politicians and diplomats hoped that Iran, North Korea, and Syria would decide to follow the Libyan model of disarmament.[5] Gaddafi stated that the West asked him on several occasions to advise Iran and North Korea to give up their nuclear weapons programs.[5] In contrast, many participants on Al Jazeera TV criticized Gaddafi for agreeing to disarm just days after Gaddafi made his decision.[5] Gaddafi was criticized by some Arabs for giving Israel a stronger strategic edge in the region, giving legitimacy to the U.S. doctrine of preemptive war, and for not getting security concessions for Libya and the Arab world in exchange for his disarmament.[5]\\r\\nIn response, the Libyan government and its supporters stated that Libya returned to the international community, got a temporary United Nations Security Council seat, and saved some money due to it giving up its nuclear weapons program.[5] Likewise, in an Al-Sharq al-Awsat interview, Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam stated that the United States did offer security guarantees for Libya in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program and that he expected military and security cooperation agreements with the U.S. in the future.[5]\\r\\nEventually Gaddafi grew disillusioned with the things that the West offered Libya.[5] He considered it too small of a reward for Libya for giving up its nuclear weapons program.[5] Gaddafi was also dissatisfied at the United States' slowness in normalizing relations with Libya and in pressuring Israel to denuclearize.[5] According to Gaddafi's son Saif, this was one of the main reasons why Gaddafi temporarily suspended shipping Libya's enriched uranium abroad in 2009 like he promised he would in 2003.[5] Gaddafi wanted to use the remains of his nuclear weapons program to gain more leverage.[5]\\r\\nAs of September 2013, 1.6 metric tons of mustard blister agent loaded in artillery rounds, 2.5 metric tons of congealed mustard agent, and 846 metric tons of chemical weapons ingredients remained to be destroyed.[2] According to The New York Times, on February 2014, the remnants of Libya's chemical weapons had been discreetly destroyed by the United States and Libya, using a transportable oven technology to destroy hundreds of bombs and artillery rounds filled with deadly mustard agent.[12]\\r\\nOn May 2018, North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan rejected assertion by U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton's assertion that North Korean denuclearization should follow the Libyan disarmament model.[13]\\r\\nDuring the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya, Gaddafi tried using Libya's voluntary disarmament to convince NATO to cease its Libya operations.[5] At the same time, Gaddafi's son Saif and others in the Libyan government expressed their regret about Libya's previous disarmament.[5] It was speculated in the media (especially in the Middle Eastern media) that NATO's 2011 intervention in Libya (which led to Gaddafi's overthrow and killing at the hands of the Libyan rebels) would make Iran, North Korea, and possibly other countries more reluctant to give up their nuclear programs and/or nuclear weapons due to the risk of being weakened and/or double-crossed as a result.[5][14]\\r\\nOn 22 September 2011, near Sabha, Libya, toward the end of the Libyan Civil War, anti-Gaddafi forces discovered two warehouses containing thousands of blue barrels marked with tape reading \\"radioactive\\" and plastic bags of yellow powder sealed with the same tape.[15][16] The IAEA stated, \\"We can confirm that there is yellowcake stored in drums at a site near Sabha ... which Libya previously declared to the IAEA. ... The IAEA has tentatively scheduled safeguards activities at this location once the situation in the country stabilises.\\"[17]","input":"When did libya give up its nuclear weapons?"},{"output":"Major General Ulysses S. Grant","context":"F 63,000 (estimated):[7]\\r\\nThe Battle of Shiloh, also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was a major battle in the Western Theater of the American Civil War, fought April 6ÿ7, 1862, in southwestern Tennessee. A Union force known as the Army of the Tennessee under Major General Ulysses S. Grant had moved via the Tennessee River deep into Tennessee and was encamped principally at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee on the west bank of that river, where the Confederate Army of Mississippi, under General Albert Sidney Johnston and second-in-command P. G. T. Beauregard, launched a surprise attack on Grant's army from its base in Corinth, Mississippi. Johnston was mortally wounded during the fighting; Beauregard, who thus succeeded to command of the army, decided against pressing the attack late in the evening. Overnight Grant was reinforced by one of his own divisions stationed further north and was joined by three divisions from another Union army under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell. This allowed them to launch an unexpected counterattack the next morning which completely reversed the Confederate gains of the previous day.\\r\\nOn April 6, the first day of the battle, the Confederates struck with the intention of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west. Johnston hoped to defeat Grant's army before the anticipated arrival of General Buell's Army of the Ohio. The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fierce fighting, and Grant's men instead fell back to the northeast, in the direction of Pittsburg Landing. A Union position on a slightly sunken road, nicknamed the \\"Hornet's Nest,\\" defended by the men of Brig. Gens. Benjamin Prentiss's and William H. L. Wallace's divisions, provided critical time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries. Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed, while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered. General Johnston was shot in the leg and bled to death while personally leading an attack. Beauregard, his second in command, acknowledged how tired the army was from the day's exertions and decided against assaulting the final Union position that night.\\r\\nTired but unfought and well-organized men from Buell's army and a division of Grant's army arrived in the evening of April 6 and helped turn the tide the next morning, when the Union commanders launched a counterattack along the entire line. Confederate forces were forced to retreat from the area, ending their hopes of blocking the Union advance into northern Mississippi. The Battle of Shiloh was the bloodiest battle in American history up to that time. It was eventually superseded that coming September by the Battle of Antietam (an overall bloodier battle, and still the bloodiest single-day in American military history), then the next year by the Battle of Chancellorsville, and, soon after, the three-day Battle of Gettysburg, which would prove to be the bloodiest overall battle of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the losses of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, the site of a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points farther south via the Tennessee River.[17]\\r\\nIn early March, Union Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck, then commander of the Department of the Missouri, ordered Grant to remain at Fort Henry, and on March 4 turned field command of the expedition over to a subordinate, Brig. Gen. C. F. Smith, who had recently been nominated as a major general.[18] (Various writers assert that Halleck took this step because of professional and personal animosity toward Grant; however, Halleck shortly restored Grant to full command, perhaps influenced by an inquiry from President Abraham Lincoln.)[19] Smith's orders were to lead raids intended to capture or damage the railroads in southwestern Tennessee. Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's troops arrived from Paducah, Kentucky, to conduct a similar mission to break the railroads near Eastport, Mississippi.[20] Halleck also ordered Grant to advance his Army of West Tennessee (soon to be known by its more famous name, the Army of the Tennessee) on an invasion up the Tennessee River. Grant left Fort Henry and headed upriver (south), arriving at Savannah, Tennessee, on March 14, and established his headquarters on the east bank of the river. Grant's troops set up camp farther upriver: five divisions at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, and a sixth at Crump's Landing, four miles from Grant's headquarters.[21]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Halleck's command was enlarged through consolidation of Grant's and Buell's armies and renamed the Department of the Mississippi. With Buell's Army of the Ohio under his command, Halleck ordered Buell to concentrate with Grant at Savannah.[22] Buell began a march with much of his army from Nashville, Tennessee, and headed southwest toward Savannah. Halleck intended to take the field in person and lead both armies in an advance south to seize Corinth, Mississippi, where the Mobile and Ohio Railroad linking Mobile, Alabama, to the Ohio River intersected the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. The railroad was a vital supply line connecting the Mississippi River at Memphis, Tennessee to Richmond, Virginia.[23]\\r\\nMaj. Gen.\\r\\nUlysses S. Grant, USA\\r\\nMaj.

Grant's Army of the Tennessee of 44,895[9][24] men consisted of six divisions:\\r\\nOf the six divisions encamped on the western side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being more concerned with his own plans than with those of the enemy.[25] His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most consequential lack of such concernhis army was spread out in bivouac style, with many of his men surrounding a small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.\\r\\nIn his memoirs, Grant reacted to criticism of his lack of entrenchments: \\"Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill more than they did experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances I concluded that drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications.\\"[26] Lew Wallace's division was 5 miles (8.0?km) downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about 20 miles (32?km) to the south.[27]\\r\\nThe portion of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio that was engaged in the battle consisted of four divisions:\\r\\nOn April 5, the eve of battle, the first of Buell's divisions, under the command of Brig. Gen. William \\"Bull\\" Nelson, reached Savannah. Grant instructed Nelson to encamp there instead of immediately crossing the river. The remainder of Buell's army, still marching toward Savannah with only portions of four of his divisions, totaling 17,918[28] men, did not reach the area in time to have a significant role in the battle until its second day. Buell's three other divisions were led by Brig. Gens. Alexander M. McCook, Thomas L. Crittenden, and Thomas J. Wood. (Wood's division appeared too late even to be of much service on the second day.)[29]\\r\\nGen.\\r\\nAlbert Sidney Johnston, CSA\\r\\nGen.\\r\\nP. G. T. Beauregard, CSA\\r\\nMaj.

Johnston named his newly assembled force the Army of Mississippi.[6] Johnston was one of the most experienced officers at this point in the war, having participated in five different wars for three different nations during a military career that covered 34 years. Jefferson Davis once said \\"\\"If Johnston is not a general, then we have no general.\\"[30] He concentrated almost 55,000 men around Corinth, Mississippi, about 20 miles (32?km) southwest of Grant's troops at Pittsburg Landing. Of these men, 40,335[11][12] departed from Corinth on April 3, hoping to surprise Grant before Buell arrived to join forces. They were organized into four large corps, commanded by:\\r\\nOn the eve of battle, Grant's and Johnston's armies were of comparable size, but the Confederates were poorly armed with antique weapons, including shotguns, hunting rifles, pistols, flintlock muskets, and even a few pikes; however, some regiments, such as the 6th and 7th Kentucky Infantry, had Enfield rifles.[31] The troops approached the battle with very little combat experience; Braxton Bragg's men from Pensacola and Mobile were the best trained. Grant's army included 32 out of 62 infantry regiments who had combat experience at Fort Donelson. One half of his artillery batteries and most of his cavalry were also combat veterans.[32]\\r\\nJohnston's plan was to attack Grant's left, separate the Union army from its gunboat support and avenue of retreat on the Tennessee River, and drive it west into the swamps of Snake and Owl Creeks, where it could be destroyed. The attack on Grant was originally planned for April 4, but it was delayed forty-eight hours due to a heavy rain storm that turned roads into seas of mud, causing some units to get lost in the woods and others to grind to a halt faced with heavy traffic jams. It ended up taking Johnston 3 days to move his army just 23 miles.[34] This was a significant setback for the Confederate Army, as the originally scheduled attack would have commenced when Buell's Army of the Ohio was too far away to be of any aid to Grant. Instead, it would happen on the 6th with Buell's army close at hand and able to re-enforce Grant on the second day. Furthermore, the delay left the Confederate Army desperately short of rations. They had issued their troops 5 days of rations just before leaving Corinth, but failure to properly conserve their food intake and the 2-day delay left most troops completely out of rations by the time the battle commenced.[35]\\r\\nDuring the Confederate march, there were several minor skirmishes with Union scouts and both sides had taken prisoners.[36] Furthermore, many Confederate troops failed to maintain proper noise discipline as the army prepared for the attack. Positioned only a few miles from the Union Army, the rebel soldiers routinely played their bugles, pounded their drums, and even discharged their muskets hunting for game.[34] As a result, Johnston's second in command, P. G. T. Beauregard, feared that the element of surprise had been lost and recommended withdrawing to Corinth, believing that by the time the battle commenced, they would be facing an enemy \\"entrenched up to the eyes\\".[37] He was also concerned about the lack of rations, fearing that if the army got into prolonged engagement, their meager remaining food supplies would not be able to sustain them. But Johnston once more refused to consider retreat.[38]\\r\\nJohnston made the decision to attack, stating \\"I would fight them if they were a million.\\"[39] Despite Beauregard's well-founded concern, most of the Union forces did not hear the marching army approach and were unaware of the enemy camps less than 3 miles (4.8?km) away.[40]\\r\\nBefore 6?a.m. on Sunday, April 6, Johnston's army was deployed for battle, straddling the Corinth Road. The army had spent the entire night bivouacking in order of battle within 2 miles (3.2?km) of the Union camp near Sherman's headquarters at Shiloh Church.[41] Despite several contacts, a few minor skirmishes with Union forces, and the failure of the army to maintain proper noise discipline in the days leading up to the 6th, their approach and dawn assault achieved a strategic and tactical surprise. Grant wanted to avoid provoking any major battles until the linkup with Buell's Army of the Ohio was complete. Thus the Union army had sent out no scouts or regular patrols and did not have any vedettes in place for early warning, concerned that scouts and patrols might provoke a major battle before the Army of the Ohio finished crossing the river.[42] Grant telegraphed a message to Halleck on the night of April 5, \\"I have scarcely the faintest idea of an attack (general one) being made upon us, but will be prepared should such a thing take place.\\"[43] Grant's declaration proved to be overstated. Sherman, the informal camp commander at Pittsburg Landing, did not believe the Confederates had a major assault force nearby; he discounted the possibility of an attack from the south. Sherman expected that Johnston would eventually attack from the direction of Purdy, Tennessee, to the west. When Col. Jesse Appler, 53rd Ohio Infantry, warned Sherman that an attack was imminent, the general angrily replied, \\"Take your damned regiment back to Ohio. There are no Confederates closer than Corinth.\\"[43]\\r\\nAround 3?a.m., Col. Everett Peabody, commanding Brig. Gen. Benjamin Prentiss's 1st Brigade, sent a patrol of 250 infantry men from the 25th Missouri and the 12th Michigan out on reconnaissance patrol, convinced that the constant reports of Confederate contacts over the last few days meant there was a strong possibility of a large confederate force in the area. The patrol, under the command of Maj. James E. Powell, met fire from Confederates who then fled into the woods. A short time later, 5:15?a.m., they encountered Confederate outposts manned by the 3rd Mississippi Battalion, and a spirited fight lasted about an hour. Arriving messengers and sounds of gunfire from the skirmish alerted the nearest Union troops, who formed battle line positions before the Confederates were able to reach them;[44] however, the Union army command had not adequately prepared for an attack on their camps.[45] When Prentiss learned that Peabody had sent out a patrol without his authorization he was outraged and accused the Colonel of provoking a major engagement in violation of Grant's orders, but he soon realized he was facing an assault by an entire Confederate army and rushed to prepare his men for defense.[46] By 9?a.m. Union forces at Pittsburg Landing were either engaged or moving toward the front line.[47] Both Peabody and Powell were soon killed in the subsequent fighting.\\r\\nThe confusing alignment of the Confederate troops helped reduce the effectiveness of the attack, since Johnston and Beauregard had no unified battle plan. Earlier, Johnston had telegraphed Confederate President Jefferson Davis his plan for the attack: \\"Polk the left, Bragg the center, Hardee the right, Breckinridge in reserve.\\"[48] His strategy was to emphasize the attack on his right flank to prevent the Union army from reaching the Tennessee River, its supply line and avenue of retreat. Johnston instructed Beauregard to stay in the rear and direct men and supplies as needed, while he rode to the front to lead the men on the battle line. This effectively ceded control of the battle to Beauregard, who had a different concept, which was simply to attack in three waves and push the Union army eastward to the river.[49] The corps of Hardee and Bragg began the assault with their divisions in one line, nearly 3 miles (4.8?km) wide and about 2 miles (3.2?km) from its front to its rear column.[50][51] As these units advanced, they became intermingled and difficult to control. Corps commanders attacked in line without reserves, and artillery could not be concentrated to effect a breakthrough. At about 7:30?a.m., from his position in the rear, Beauregard ordered the corps of Polk and Breckinridge forward on the left and right of the line, diluting their effectiveness. The attack therefore went forward as a frontal assault conducted by a single linear formation, which lacked both the depth and weight needed for success. Units marching through rough uneven terrain were unable to maintain formation integrity and ended up mixing together with regiments from other commands. Generals ended up having to take command of zones of the battlefield rather than their own assigned divisions.[52] Command and control, in the modern sense, were lost from the onset of the first assault.[53]\\r\\nThe Confederate assault, despite its shortcomings, was ferocious, causing some of the numerous inexperienced Union soldiers in Grant's new army to flee to the river for safety. Others fought well, but were forced to withdraw under strong pressure from the Confederates, and attempted to form new defensive lines. Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent in preparing for an attack, became one of its most important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides. Sherman received two minor wounds and had three horses shot out from under him. Historian James M. McPherson cites the battle as the turning point of Sherman's life, helping him to become one of the North's premier generals.[54] Sherman's division bore the brunt of the initial attack. Despite heavy fire on their position and their left flank crumbling, Sherman's men fought stubbornly, but the Union troops slowly lost ground and fell back to a position behind Shiloh Church. McClernand's division temporarily stabilized the position. Overall, however, Johnston's forces made steady progress until noon, rolling up Union positions one by one.[55] As the Confederates advanced, many threw away their flintlock muskets and grabbed rifles dropped by the fleeing Union troops.[56]\\r\\nBy 11:00 am, the Confederate advance began to slow down, due to stiff Union resistance, but also due to disciplinary problems as the army overran the Federal camps. The sight of fresh food still burning on camp fires proved too tempting for many hungry Confederates, and many broke ranks to pillage and loot the camps, putting the army on hold until their officers could get them back into line.[57]\\r\\nGrant was about 10 miles (16?km) downriver at Savannah, Tennessee, when he heard the sound of artillery fire. (On April 4, he had been injured when his horse fell and pinned him underneath. He was convalescing and unable to move without crutches.)[58] Before leaving Savannah, Grant ordered Bull Nelson's division to march along the east side of the river, to a point opposite Pittsburg Landing, where it could be ferried over to the battlefield. Grant then took his steamboat, Tigress, to Crump's Landing, where he gave Lew Wallace his first orders, which were to wait in reserve and be ready to move.[59] Grant proceeded to Pittsburg Landing, arriving about 8:30?a.m.; most of the day went by before the first of these reinforcements arrived. (Nelson's division arrived around 5?p.m.; Wallace's appeared about 7?p.m.[60]) Wallace's slow movement to the battlefield would become particularly controversial.[61]\\r\\nOn the morning of April 6, around 8:00 or 8:30?a.m., Grant's flagship stopped alongside Wallace's boat moored at Crump's Landing and gave orders for the 3rd Division to be held ready to move in any direction. Wallace concentrated his troops at Stoney Lonesome, although his westernmost brigade remained at Adamsville. He then waited for further orders, which arrived between 11 and 11:30?a.m.[62] Grant ordered Wallace to move his unit up to join the Union right, a move that would have been in support of Sherman's 5th Division, which was encamped around Shiloh Church when the battle began. The written orders, transcribed from verbal orders that Grant gave to an aide, were lost during the battle and controversy remains over their wording.[63] Wallace maintained that he was not ordered to Pittsburg Landing, which was to the left rear of the army, or told which road to use. Grant later claimed that he ordered Wallace to Pittsburg Landing by way of the River Road (also called the HamburgÿSavannah Road).[64]\\r\\nAround noon, Wallace began the journey along the Shunpike, a route familiar to his men.[65] A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30?p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was and why he had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing.[66] If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have found himself in the rear of the advancing Confederate troops.[67]\\r\\nWallace had to make a choice: he could launch an attack and fight through the Confederate rear to reach Grant's forces closer to Pittsburg Landing, or reverse his direction and march toward Pittsburg Landing via a crossroads to the River Road. Wallace chose the second option.[67][68] (After the war, Wallace claimed that his division might have attacked and defeated the Confederates if his advance had not been interrupted,[69] but later conceded that the move would not have been successful.[68]) Rather than realign his troops so the rear guard would be in the front, Wallace made a controversial decision to countermarch his troops to maintain the original order, only facing in the other direction. The move further delayed Wallace's troops as they marched north along the Shunpike road, then took a crossover to reach the River Road to the east, and headed south toward the battlefield.[67]\\r\\nWallace's division began arriving at Grant's position about 6:30?p.m., after a march of about 14 miles (23?km) in seven hours over poor and muddy roads. It formed line on the battlefield about 7 p.m., when the fighting was nearly over for the day.[70] Although Grant showed no disapproval at the time, his later endorsement of Wallace's battle report was negative enough to severely damage Wallace's military career.[71] Today, Wallace is better remembered as the author of Ben-Hur.[72]\\r\\nOn the main Union defensive line, starting around 9?a.m., Prentiss's and W. H. L. Wallace's divisions established and held a position nicknamed the \\"Hornet's Nest\\", in a field along a road, now popularly called the \\"Sunken Road,\\" although there is little physical justification for that name.[73] The Confederates assaulted the position for several hours rather than simply bypassing it, and suffered heavy casualties. Historians' estimates of the number of separate charges range from 8 to 14.[74] The Union forces to the left and right of the Nest were forced back, making Prentiss's position a prominent point in the line. Coordination within the Nest was poor, and units withdrew based solely on their individual commanders' decisions. The pressure increased when W. H. L. Wallace, commander of the largest concentration of troops in the position, was mortally wounded while attempting to lead a breakout from the Confederate encirclement.[75] Union regiments became disorganized and companies disintegrated as the Confederates, led by Brig. Gen. Daniel Ruggles, assembled more than 50 cannons into \\"Ruggles's Battery\\",[76] the largest concentration of artillery ever assembled in North America,[77] to blast the line at close range. Confederates surrounded the Hornet's Nest, and it fell after holding out for seven hours. Prentiss surrendered himself and the remains of his division to the Confederates. A large portion of the Union survivors, an estimated 2,200 to 2,400 men, were captured, but their sacrifice bought time for Grant to establish a final defense line near Pittsburg Landing.[78]\\r\\nWhile dealing with the Hornet's Nest, the South suffered a serious setback with the death of their commanding general. Albert Sidney Johnston was mortally wounded at about 2:30?p.m. as he led attacks on the Union left through the Widow Bell's cotton field against the Peach Orchard, accompanied by Tennessee governor Isham Harris. Johnston was shot in his right leg, behind the knee.[79] Deeming the wound insignificant (possibly due to a wound he received 25 years earlier that had inflicted permanent nerve damage preventing him from feeling how bad his injury was), Johnston continued on leading the battle. Eventually, Johnston's staff members noticed him slumping in his saddle. Harris asked Johnston if he was wounded, and the general replied \\"Yes, and I fear seriously.\\"[80] Earlier in the battle, Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners, and there was no medical staff at his current location.[81] An aide helped him off his horse and laid him down under a tree, then went to fetch his surgeon, but did not apply a tourniquet to Johnston's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston bled to death from a torn popliteal artery that caused internal bleeding and blood to collect unnoticed in his riding boot.[82] Jefferson Davis considered Johnston to be the most effective general they had (this was two months before Robert E. Lee emerged as the preeminent Confederate general). Johnston was the highest-ranking officer from either side to be killed in combat during the Civil War. Beauregard assumed command, but his position in the rear, where he relied on field reports from his subordinates, may have given him only a vague idea of the disposition of forces at the front.[83][84] Beauregard ordered Johnston's body shrouded for secrecy to avoid lowering morale and resumed attacks against the Hornet's Nest. This was likely a tactical error, because the Union flanks were slowly pulling back to form a semicircular line around Pittsburg Landing. If Beauregard had concentrated his forces against the flanks, he might have defeated the Union army at the landing, and then reduced the Hornet's Nest position at his leisure.[85]\\r\\nThe Union flanks were being pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the direction of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. David Stuart and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates paused to regroup and recover from exhaustion and disorganization, then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5?km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers[86] who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. Jacob Ammen's brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line.[87] The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons[88] and naval guns from the river (the gunboats USS Lexington and USS Tyler).[89] A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break through the line but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set.[90] The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river, not forced him west into the swamps.[91]\\r\\nThe evening of April 6 was a dispiriting end to the first day of one of the bloodiest battles in American history. The cries of wounded and dying men on the fields between the armies could be heard in the Union and Confederate camps throughout the night. Exhausted Confederate soldiers bedded down in the abandoned Union camps. The Union troops were pushed back to the river and the junction of the River (HamburgÿSavannah Road) and the Corinth-Pittsburg Landing Roads.[92] Around 10 p.m. a thunderstorm passed through the area. Coupled with the continuous shelling from the Union gunboats Lexington and Tyler, it made the night a miserable experience for both sides.[68]\\r\\nA famous anecdote encapsulates Grant's unflinching attitude to temporary setbacks and his tendency for offensive action. Sometime after midnight, Sherman encountered Grant standing under a tree, sheltering himself from the pouring rain and smoking one of his cigars, while considering his losses and planning for the next day. Sherman remarked, \\"Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?\\" Grant looked up. \\"Yes,\\" he replied, followed by a puff. \\"Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though.\\"[93]\\r\\nBeauregard sent a telegram to President Davis announcing a complete victory. He later admitted, \\"I thought I had Grant just where I wanted him and could finish him up in the morning.\\"[95] Many of his men were jubilant, having overrun the Union camps and taken thousands of prisoners and tons of supplies. Grant still had reason to be optimistic: Lew Wallace's 5,800 men (minus the two regiments guarding the supplies at Crump's Landing) and 15,000 of Don Carlos Buell's army began to arrive that evening. Wallace's division took up a position on the right of the Union line and was in place by 1 a.m.;[96] Buell's men were fully on the scene by 4 a.m., in time to turn the tide the next day.[97]\\r\\nBeauregard caused considerable historical controversy with his decision to halt the assault at dusk. Braxton Bragg and Albert Sidney Johnston's son, Col. William Preston Johnston, were among those who bemoaned the so-called \\"lost opportunity at Shiloh.\\" Beauregard did not come to the front to inspect the strength of the Union lines; he remained at Shiloh Church. He also discounted intelligence reports from Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest (and bluster from prisoner of war General Prentiss[98]) that Buell's men were crossing the river to reinforce Grant. In defense of his decision, Beauregard's troops were simply exhausted, there was less than an hour of daylight left, and Grant's artillery advantage was formidable. In addition, he had received a dispatch from Brig. Gen. Benjamin Hardin Helm in northern Alabama that indicated Buell was marching toward Decatur and not Pittsburg Landing.[99]\\r\\nOn Monday morning, April 7, the combined Union armies numbered 45,000 men; the Confederates suffered as many as 8,500 casualties the first day and their commanders reported no more than 20,000 effectives due to stragglers and deserters. (Buell disputed that figure after the war, stating that there were 28,000). The Confederates had withdrawn south into Prentiss's and Sherman's former camps, while Polk's corps retired to the Confederate bivouac established on April 5, which was 4 miles (6.4?km) southwest of Pittsburg Landing. No line of battle was formed, and few if any commands were resupplied with ammunition. The soldiers were consumed by the need to locate food, water, and shelter for a much-needed night's rest.[100]\\r\\nBeauregard, unaware that he was now outnumbered, planned to continue the attack and drive Grant into the river. To his surprise, Union forces started moving forward in a massive counterattack at dawn. Grant and Buell launched their attacks separately; coordination occurred only at the division level. Lew Wallace's division was the first to see action, about 5:30?a.m., at the extreme right of the Union line.[101] Wallace continued the advance, crossing Tilghman Branch around 7 a.m. and met little resistance. Changing direction and moving to the southwest, Wallace's men drove back the brigade of Col. Preston Pond. On Wallace's left were the survivors of Sherman's division, then McClernand's, and W. H. L. Wallace's (now under the command of Col. James M. Tuttle). Buell's army continued to the left with Bull Nelson's, Crittenden's, and McCook's divisions. The Confederate defenders were so badly commingled that little unit cohesion existed above the brigade level. It required more than two hours to locate Gen. Polk and bring up his division from its bivouac to the southwest. By 10 a.m., Beauregard had stabilized his front with his corps commanders from left to right: Bragg, Polk, Breckinridge, and Hardee.[102] In a thicket near the Hamburg-Purdy Road, the fighting was so intense that Sherman described in his report of the battle \\"the severest musketry fire I ever heard.\\"[103]\\r\\nOn the Union left, Nelson's division led the advance, followed closely by Crittenden's and McCook's men, down the Corinth and Hamburg-Savannah roads. After heavy fighting, Crittenden's division recaptured the Hornet's Nest area by late morning, but the Crittenden and Nelson forces were repulsed by determined counterattacks from Breckinridge. Wallace's and Sherman's men on the Union right made steady progress, driving Bragg and Polk to the south. As Crittenden and McCook resumed their attacks, Breckinridge was forced to retire. By noon Beauregard's line paralleled the Hamburg-Purdy Road.[104]\\r\\nIn early afternoon, Beauregard launched a series of counterattacks from the Shiloh Church area, aiming to control the Corinth Road. The Union right was temporarily driven back by these assaults at Water Oaks Pond. Crittenden, reinforced by Tuttle, seized the junction of the Hamburg-Purdy and East Corinth roads, driving the Confederates into Prentiss's old camps. Nelson resumed his attack and seized the heights overlooking Locust Grove Branch by late afternoon. Beauregard's final counterattack was flanked and repulsed when Grant moved Col. James C. Veatch's brigade forward.[105]\\r\\nRealizing that he had lost the initiative, was low on ammunition and food, and had more than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an orderly withdrawal southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly 2 miles (3.2?km), but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark.[106] The battle was over.\\r\\nFor long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's decision not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the exhaustion of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act could have been the unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.[107]\\r\\nOn April 8, Grant sent Sherman south along the Corinth Road on a reconnaissance in force to confirm that the Confederates had retreated, or if they were regrouping to resume their attacks. Grant's army lacked the large organized cavalry units that would have been better suited for reconnaissance and vigorous pursuit of a retreating enemy. Sherman marched with two infantry brigades from his division, along with two battalions of cavalry, and met Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood's division of Buell's army. Six miles (10?km) southwest of Pittsburg Landing, Sherman's men came upon a clear field in which an extensive camp was erected, including a Confederate field hospital. The camp was protected by 300 troopers of Confederate cavalry, commanded by Col. Nathan Bedford Forrest. The road approaching the field was covered by fallen trees for more than 200 yards (180?m).[108]\\r\\nAs skirmishers from the 77th Ohio Infantry approached, having difficulty clearing the fallen timber, Forrest ordered a charge. The wild melee, with Confederate troops firing shotguns and revolvers and brandishing sabers, nearly resulted in Forrest's capture. As Col. Jesse Hildebrand's brigade began forming in line of battle, the Southern troopers started to retreat at the sight of the strong force, and Forrest, who was well in advance of his men, came within a few yards of the Union soldiers before realizing he was all alone. Sherman's men yelled out, \\"Kill him! Kill him and his horse!\\"[109] A Union soldier shoved his musket into Forrest's side and fired, striking him above the hip, penetrating to near the spine. Although he was seriously wounded, Forrest was able to stay on horseback and escape; he survived both the wound and the war. The Union lost about 100 men, most of them captured during Forrest's charge, in an incident that has been remembered with the name \\"Fallen Timbers\\". After capturing the Confederate field hospital, Sherman encountered the rear of Breckinridge's covering force, but determined the enemy was making no signs of renewing its attack and withdrew back to the Union camps.[110]\\r\\nIn his Memoirs Grant intimated that,\\r\\n\\"The battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg landing, has been perhaps less understood, or, to state the case more accurately, more persistently misunderstood, than any other engagement between National and Confederate troops during the entire rebellion. Correct reports of the battle have been published, notably by Sherman, Badeau and, in a speech before a meeting of veterans, by General Prentiss; but all of these appeared long subsequent to the close of the rebellion and after public opinion had been most erroneously formed\\"\\r\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the battle, Northern newspapers vilified Grant for his performance during the battle on April 6, especially for being surprised and unprepared. Reporters, many far from the battle, spread the story that Grant had been drunk, falsely alleging that this had resulted in many of his men being bayoneted in their tents because of a lack of defensive preparedness. Despite the Union victory, Grant's reputation suffered in Northern public opinion. Many credited Buell with taking control of the broken Union forces and leading them to victory on April 7. Calls for Grant's removal overwhelmed the White House. President Lincoln replied with one of his most famous quotations about Grant: \\"I can't spare this man; he fights.\\"[113] Although all of the Union division commanders fought well, Sherman emerged as an immediate hero after Grant and Halleck commended him especially. His steadfastness under fire and amid chaos atoned for his previous melancholy and his defensive lapses preceding the battle.[114]\\r\\nArmy officers that were with Grant gave a starkly different account of his capacity, and performance, than those of enterprising newspaper reporters far away from Grant during the battle. One such officer, Colonel William R. Rowley, answering a letter of inquiry about allegations aimed at Grant, maintained:\\r\\n\\"I pronounce it an unmitigated slander. I have been on his Staff ever since the Donelson affair (and saw him frequently during that) and necessary in close contact with him every day, and I have never seen him take even a glass of liquor more than two or three times in my life and then only a single at a time. And I have never seen him intoxicated or even approximate to it. As to the story that he was intoxicated at the Battle of Pittsburg, I have only to say that the man who fabricated the story is an infamous liar, and you are at liberty to say to him that I say so. ...\\"\\r\\nIn retrospect, however, Grant is recognized positively for the clear judgment he was able to retain under the strenuous circumstances, and his ability to perceive the larger tactical picture that ultimately resulted in victory on the second day.[114]\\r\\nNevertheless, Grant's career suffered temporarily in the aftermath of Shiloh. Halleck combined and reorganized his armies, relegating Grant to the powerless position of second-in-command. Meanwhile, Beauregard remained in command of the Army of Mississippi and led it back to Corinth. In late April and May, the Union armies, under Halleck's personal command, advanced slowly toward Corinth and captured it, while an amphibious force on the Mississippi River destroyed the Confederates' River Defense Fleet and captured Memphis, Tennessee. Halleck was promoted to be general in chief of all the Union armies. With Halleck's departure to the East, Grant was restored to command and eventually pushed down the Mississippi River to besiege Vicksburg, Mississippi. After the surrender of Vicksburg and the fall of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, the Mississippi River was under Union control and the Confederacy was cut in two.\\r\\nDavis was outraged at Beauregard for withdrawing from Corinth without a fight, even though he faced an army nearly twice his size and his water supplies in the city had become contaminated. Shortly after the fall of Corinth, Beauregard took medical leave without receiving authorization from Davis. This was the final straw for Davis, who quickly reassigned him to oversee the coastal defenses in South Carolina. Command of the Army of Mississippi fell to Braxton Bragg, who was promoted to full general on April 6, and during the fall of 1862, he led it on an unsuccessful invasion of Kentucky, culminating in his retreat from the Battle of Perryville.[116]\\r\\nUnion General Lew Wallace was heavily criticized for failing to get his division into the battle until 1830 hours, near the end of combat on the first day. He was removed from the Army of the Tennessee and would never again get a front line command or take part in a major offensive operation, though his backwater assignments would still place him in important battles. Shortly after Shiloh, he was sent to the War Department in Ohio where he led the successful Defense of Cincinnati during Bragg's invasion of Kentucky. In 1864, at the Battle of Monocacy, Wallace commanded a 5,800 man force tasked with opposing Jubal Early's 14,000 man invasion of Maryland. Faced against an army more than twice his size, Wallace was eventually forced to retreat to Baltimore, but his men delayed Early's advance for a full day, enabling Union re-enforcement to be brought up to secure Washington D. C. from Early's further incursion. Despite this success, and later fame for writing the book Ben Hur, criticism of Wallace's conduct at Shiloh would haunt him for the rest of his life and he would spend much of it trying to defend his actions there.\\r\\nThe two-day battle of Shiloh, the costliest in American history up to that time,[117] resulted in the defeat of the Confederate army and frustration of Johnston's plans to prevent the two Union armies in Tennessee from joining together. Union casualties were 13,047 (1,754 killed, 8,408 wounded, and 2,885 missing); Grant's army bore the brunt of the fighting over the two days, with casualties of 1,513 killed, 6,601 wounded, and 2,830 missing or captured. Confederate casualties were 10,699 (1,728 killed, 8,012 wounded, and 959 missing or captured).[118] The dead included the Confederate army's commander, Albert Sidney Johnston, as well as Brigadier General Adley H. Gladden. The highest ranking Union general killed was W. H. L. Wallace. Union Colonel Everett Peabody, whose decision to send out a patrol the morning of the battle may have saved the Union from disaster, was also among the dead. Both sides were shocked at the carnage, which resulted more than four times as many casualties as the Battle of Bull Run that had horrified the nation 10 months earlier.\\r\\n\\"I saw an open field, in our possession on the second day, over which the Confederates had made repeated charges the day before, so covered with dead that it would have been possible to walk across the clearing, in any direction, stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.\\"\\r\\nThree more years of such bloodshed remained and eight larger and bloodier battles were yet to come.[119] Grant later came to realize that his prediction of one great battle bringing the war to a close would probably not occur. The war would continue, at great cost in casualties and resources, until the Confederacy succumbed or the Union was divided. Grant also learned a valuable personal lesson on preparedness that (mostly) served him well for the rest of the war.[120]\\r\\nThe loss of Albert Johnston was a particularly severe blow to the Confederacy. President Jefferson Davis called it \\"the turning point of our fate.\\"[121] For the remainder of the war, the Confederate armies in the West would go through a long string of commanders, much like the Union in the east, as Davis searched for a leader who was the caliber of Robert E. Lee.\\r\\nIn addition to those already mentioned, several other famous people participated in the Battle of Shiloh\\r\\nShiloh's importance as a Civil War battle, coupled with the lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development as one of the first five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 acres at Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved.[122] Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The Civil War Trust became the primary agent of these efforts, preserving 1,158 acres at Shiloh since its inception.[123] The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank on day one and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.[124]\\r\\nShiloh National Military Park is managed by the National Park Service.\\r\\nThe United States Postal Service released a commemorative stamp on the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Shiloh, first issued through the Shiloh, Tennessee, Post Office on April 7, 1962. It was the second in a series of five stamps marking the Civil War Centennial.[125]\\r\\nThe writer Ambrose Bierce was at Shiloh as a First Lieutenant on Gen. William B. Hazen's staff, serving as a topographical engineer. He recalled his experiences in the short story \\"What I Saw of Shiloh\\", written in 1874 and twice revised in the following 35 years. He describes Pittsburg Landing as follows: \\"Here in 1862 were some fields and a house or two; now there are a national cemetery and other improvements.\\" Some scholars think 'What I Saw of Shiloh' is Bierce's best work.[126][127][128]\\r\\nThe song \\"Shiloh's Hill\\" was written shortly after the battle and soon became a popular civil war tune.[129]\\r\\nThe Battle of Shiloh was depicted in the 1962 film How the West Was Won, directed by John Ford.\\r\\nShel Silverstein wrote \\"In the Hills of Shiloh\\", a poignant song about widowed bride forever awaiting the return of a man killed in the battle of Shiloh. The song was recorded by The New Christy Minstrels, Judy Collins, and others.\\r\\nBobbie Ann Mason's short story \\"Shiloh\\", which appeared in The New Yorker on October 20, 1980, describes a visit to the site of the battle by a modern couple whose marriage is about to collapse.

In January 2012, Heigl reported that she would like to return to Grey's Anatomy to give closure to her character, however, Rhimes confirmed that there were no plans to have the character return at that time and has since stated that she has no plans to ever re-approach Izzie's storyline again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIzzie appears in the first episode of Grey's Anatomy, meeting fellow interns Meredith Grey, Cristina Yang, Alex Karev, and George O'Malley.[1] She and George move in with Meredith and become best friends.[2] Izzie's boyfriend, hockey player Hank (Jonathan Scarfe), struggles to accept her new role as a surgeon, and the two break up.[3] Izzie is hurt when Alex exposes her past as a lingerie model.[4] However, the two later go on to begin a friendship and then a romance.[5] Alex experiences sexual dysfunction with Izzie and cheats on her with nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback).[6] When Izzie finds out, she breaks up with him, though they briefly reunite following a bomb incident at the hospital.[7] Izzie reveals while treating a pregnant teenager that she had a daughter at the age of 16 and gave her up for adoption. Izzie falls in love with cardiothoracic patient Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and the two become engaged. When Denny's condition deteriorates, Izzie deliberately worsens his health further by cutting his LVAD wire to move him up the donor register.[8] Although Denny receives a new heart, he has a stroke hours later and dies.[9] Izzie is the sole beneficiary of Denny's will, inheriting $8.7?million.[10] She uses the money to open a free clinic at the hospital: the Denny Duquette Memorial Clinic.[11]\\r\\nIzzie disapproves of George's relationship and marriage to orthopedic resident Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).[12] She and George sleep together, and attempt to keep their liaison a secret.[13] George and resident Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) are the only people aware that Izzie gave birth to a daughter at the age of sixteen; ultimately the child was given up for adoption. He supports Izzie when her daughter Hannah (Liv Hutchings), diagnosed with leukemia, arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital in need of a bone marrow transplant from Izzie.[14] Izzie's feelings for George grow, and she reveals that she has fallen in love with him.[15] When Callie discovers George has been unfaithful, the two separate,[16] and George and Izzie embark on a short-lived relationship, only to discover there is no real chemistry between them.[17]\\r\\nIzzie supports Alex when he discovers his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces him to have her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities.[18] Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny.[19] She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%.[20] She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain.[21] Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry in front of all their friends.[22] The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining.[23] Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.[24]\\r\\nIzzie makes a treatment error that endangers the life of a patient, and is fired from the hospital's surgical program. Believing Alex is partially to blame, she writes him a Dear John letter and leaves.[25] Izzie later learns that Alex was not responsible for her lost job, and returns to make amends with him, but Meredith informs her that Alex is moving on. Izzie informs Alex that she no longer has cancer. Although he is pleased, Alex officially breaks up with Izzie, telling her that he loves her but deserves better. She leaves Seattle to start fresh.[26] Several episodes later, Alex informs Meredith that Izzie sent divorce papers, which he signs in the episode \\"How Insensitive\\".[27] In the sixth-season finale, Alex is shot and asks for Izzie. Imagining that Meredith's half-sister Lexie (Chyler Leigh) is Izzie, he apologizes and asks her never to leave him again.[28] In the 300th episode, Alex reveals he never found out what happened to Izzie, but envisions a perfect, happy life for her, always smiling, now that he has moved on.\\r\\nIzzie was created by Grey's Anatomy producer Shonda Rhimes, with actress Katherine Heigl cast in the role. Heigl originally wanted to play Izzie as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blond for the part.[29] Heigl's comprehension of medical procedures and terminology is slight; the actress explained that while she has an admiration for doctors, she is not as fascinated by medicine as other cast members.[30] When Kate Walsh's character Addison Montgomery left Grey's Anatomy to launch the spin-off show Private Practice, Heigl disclosed that she had hoped for a spin-off for Izzie.[31]\\r\\nHeigl declined to put her name forward for consideration at the 2008 Emmy Awards, claiming that she had been given insufficient material on the series to warrant a nomination.[32] Following Heigl's statement, speculation arose that her character would suffer a brain tumor and be killed off Grey's Anatomy, substantiated by the announcement Jeffrey Dean Morgan would return to the series as Denny, who died at the end of season two.[33] ABC's entertainment president Steve McPherson denied the rumor, stating: \\"There is an unbelievable storyline for her this year, which is really central to everything that's going to go on this season\\".[34]\\r\\nSpeculation resumed, however, when Dean Morgan returned to the show for a second time in its fifth season.[35] Cast member James Pickens, Jr. announced that both Heigl and T.R. Knight were set to depart from the show,[36] but he later retracted his comment.[37] During the course of the fifth season, Izzie was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which spread to her liver, skin and brain. Following the show's one-hundredth episode wrap party, Heigl revealed she did not know if Izzie would survive, as no one on the production team would disclose her character's fate to her.[38] It was confirmed in June 2009 that Heigl would return as Izzie for the show's sixth season.[39] Heigl's appearances in the season were sporadic, seeing Izzie depart and return twice.[40] Although she was scheduled to appear in the final five episodes of the season, Heigl requested that she be released from her contract 18?months early, and made her final appearance on January 21, 2010.[41] Heigl explained that she wanted to spend more time with her family, and did not think it would be respectful to Grey's Anatomy viewers to have Izzie return and depart yet again.[40] Michael Ausiello spoke further on Katherine Heigl's perspective on Izzie's departure. He said, \\"[Katherine] thinks her Jan. 21 farewell - while not originally intended to be her last episode - oddly works as a bookend to Izzie's story. \\"Even though there's a part of me that would like to go back and do the quick Izzie farewell, \\" she says, \\"I also think that my last scene - where Meredith says to Izzie, 'Don't go, we're your family,' and Izzie's response was, 'No you're not, you're just a bunch of people I worked with, and I can find that anywhere' - was kind of tragic and appropriate all at the same time. When I was playing the scene I was really trying to convey that, for Izzie, that was a lie that she had to tell herself to have the courage to have to move on.\\"[42]\\r\\nIn August 2010, Rhimes stated that she did not feel Izzie's character arcspecifically her relationship with Alexhad fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season.[43] She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: \\"I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [Katherine] were to come back, we would be thrilled to [wrap up her story]. But if she doesn't, we'll just move on.\\"[44] Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character returning to show looks bleak because, \\"that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard.\\" She also felt that Izzie coming back to the show would, \\"just feel manipulative.\\"[45]\\r\\nHowever, in January 2012, Heigl stated in an interview that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: \\"I've told them I want to [return],\\" she said. \\"I really, really, really want to see where [Izzie] is. I just want to know what happened to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back.\\"[46] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, \\"Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... you grow up together, in a way,\\" and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, \\"I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there.\\"[47] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, \\"I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now.\\"[48] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, Im done with that story. Ive turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I dont think so.[49]\\r\\nHeigl believes that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a \\"super moral\\" version of herself.[50] Episode \\"Bring the Pain\\", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended to be the final episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came \\"full circle\\" from her role in the pilot: \\"Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in \\"Bring the Pain\\".\\"[51] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is \\"immensely kind\\" and patient.[29] When Denny died in the season two episode \\"Losing My Religion\\", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine.[52] In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor.[50] Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature,[50] and Heigl affirmed that \\"At the beginning of the [third] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people.\\"[50] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: \\"I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing and that made me overjoyed because thats the kind of thing people do.\\"[53]\\r\\nDiscussing Izzie's relationship with Alex in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that \\"Even when Alex was a complete dirtbag to her [Izzie], she forgave him and gave him another chance. And he really screwed her over. [...] To go for a guy like that is to say I want to be damaged.'\\"[29] Writer Stacy McKee deemed Izzie's moving on from Alex to patient Denny Duquette \\"karma\\", as Alex previously treated Izzie badly, yet as he begins to realize his true feelings, he is forced to watch her embark on a romance with \\"the undeniably handsome - and totally charming\\" Denny.[54] Series writer Blythe Robe commented on Izzie and Denny: \\"I love the way Izzie lights up when she's around him. I love their relationship because it's so pure and honest and completely game free.\\"[55] Writer Elizabeth Klaviter noted at this time the way Izzie \\"seems to be sacrificing her reputation because of her feelings for Denny.\\"[56] When Izzie deliberately worsened Denny's condition to move him up the transplant list, series writer Mark Wilding questioned the morality of the actions, asking: \\"is Izzie bad for doing it? Is she tremendously irresponsible? She cut the LVAD wire for love so does that make her action understandable?\\"[57]\\r\\nRhimes discussed costuming choices in the scene which saw the interns gather around Denny's deathbed, explaining: \\"Meredith and George and Cristina and Callie and Alex are all dressed, not for a prom, but for a funeral. Everyone in dark colors, everyone dressed somberly. As if they were in mourning. Only Izzie is in happy pink. Only Izzie looks like she didnt know this was coming.\\"[52] Following Denny's death, Heigl approached Rhimes to ask when her character would next have a romantic liaison. Rhimes explained that \\"Izzie doesn't sleep around\\".[50] Heigl expressed a desire for Izzie to reunite with Alex, explaining: \\"I believe on some level, there's a connection between Izzie and Alex. He can do honorable things even though he's cutting and sarcastic. I would like to ultimately see them together, if not this season, then next.\\"[50]\\r\\nYahoo! Voices wrote that Stevens in the third season \\"has become more condescending and passive aggressive herself, more than anyone else.\\"[59] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed \\"a ratings ploy\\".[58] Heigl explained: \\"They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot.\\"[58] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that:\\r\\nPeople who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend to be the first to slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because whats interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.[60]\\r\\nHeigl was nominated for the \\"Best Supporting Actress in a TV Series\\" award at the 2007 and 2008 Golden Globe Awards for her role as Izzie.[61] She was named \\"Favorite Female TV Star\\" at the 34th People's Choice Awards,[62] and awarded \\"Outstanding Supporting Actress In A Drama Series\\" at the 2007 Emmy Awards.[63] Prior to the ceremony, considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Variety's Stuart Levine assessed of her performance: \\"Heigl has little difficulty reaching Izzie's highest highs and lowest lows. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes puts a lot of pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge.\\"[64] Levine also noted, however: \\"There are times when Izzie becomes completely irrational during crisis situations, which may bother some.\\"[64] Fox News included Izzie in its list of \\"The Best TV Doctors For Surgeon General\\".[65] The character was listed in Wetpaint's \\"10 Hottest Female Doctors on TV\\" and in BuzzFeed's \\"16 Hottest Doctors On Television\\".[66][67]\\r\\nDuring the show's third season, the New York Post's Robert Rorke deemed Izzie to be \\"the heart and soul\\" of Grey's Anatomy. He deemed her the show's heroine, and wrote that: \\"Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette. [...] Besides the formidable Dr. Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Izzie seems to be the only adult intern at Seattle Grace; the character has achieved a depth lacking in her fellow interns.\\"[50] Eyder Peralta of The Houston Chronicle was critical of Izzie's ethics in cutting Denny's LVAD wire, writing that she \\"should not be practising medicine\\" and stating: \\"That's the reason I don't watch Grey's Anatomy, anymore, because the super hot blond chick can make an earth-shattering, fatal decision and she doesn't get canned.\\"[68]\\r\\nThe season four romance between Izzie and George proved unpopular with viewers, and resulted in a fan backlash among Alex and Izzie fans.[69] The return of Izzie's deceased fianc Denny and the resumption of their romance during the show's fifth season also proved unpopular with fans,[70] and was deemed \\"the world's worst storyline\\" by Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times.[71] McNamara was also critical of the episode \\"Now or Never\\", which saw Izzie flatline following neurosurgery, opining that Izzie ought to die.[71] The episode in which Izzie married long-term love Alex received 15.3 million viewers, the largest television audience of the night.[72]\\r\\nIzzie's cancer storyline received a mixed response from the medical community. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society, commented that Izzie's treatment options were unrealistic. Whereas in the show she was offered the drug interleukin-2, in reality the drug is never recommended to patients when melanoma has spread to the brain, as it can cause bleeding and strokes. Brawley explained that such patients would instead be offered radiosurgery.[73] Conversely however, Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, praised Grey's Anatomy for bringing about greater public awareness of melanoma, stating: \\"We welcome the national spotlight Grey's Anatomy has created for melanoma and its efforts to encourage viewers to learn more about the importance of prevention, early detection and research.\\"[74]\\r\\nSpecific\\r\\nGeneral","input":"What season does izzie stevens leave grey's anatomy?"},{"output":"Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala","context":"Executive:\\r\\n\\r\\nFederal Parliament:\\r\\n\\r\\nJudiciary:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position of Prime Minister of Nepal (Nepali: ??????? ?????????????; Nplak pradhnamantrؐ) in modern form was called by different names at different times of Nepalese history. At the time of the Shah dynasty, the Mulkajis (Chief Kajis) served the function of Prime Ministers. In 1806, the position of Mukhtiyar was created by Rana Bahadur Shah which carried executive powers of nation.[3] Mukhtiyar is formed from two words: Mukhya and Akhtiyar. Mukhya means Chief[4] and Akhtiyar means Authority.[5] Altogether it means the \\"Executive Head of the State\\". Mukhtiyar held the position of Executive Head till adoption of title of Prime Minister on 1843 A.D.[6] During the Rana dynasty, the position of Prime Minister was hereditary and the officeholder held additional titles  Maharaja of Lambjang and Kaski, Supreme Commander-in-Chief of Nepal and Grand Master of the Royal Orders of Nepal. The Prime Minister of Nepal does not have a term limit. \\r\\n\\r\\nMukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa was the first person to be referred to as Prime Minister by the British. However, the first Mukhtiyar to title himself as Prime Minister, as per the British convention, was Bhimsen's nephew, Mathabar Singh Thapa.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nFew of Nepalese Prime Ministers have carried a democratic mandate. The first elected Prime Minister was Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, in 1959. After he was deposed and imprisoned in 1960, the King established the Panchayat system and Nepal did not have a democratic government until 1990, when the country became a constitutional monarchy after the Jana Andolan movement. The monarchy was abolished on 28 May 2008 by the 1st Constituent Assembly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Prime Minister is Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, since 15 February 2018.[7] The residence of Prime Minister of Nepal is in Baluwatar, Kathmandu.[1][8] The seat of the Prime Minister is Singha Darbar since the time of Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana.[9] The basic monthly salary of Prime Minister of Nepal is NPR 77,280.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of government in Kingdom of Nepal was driven from consultative state organ of the previous Gorkha hill principality, known as Bharadar.[10][note 1] These Bharadars were drawn from high caste and politically influential families. For instance; Thar Ghar in previous Gorkha hill principality. The nobility of Gorkha were mainly based from Chhetri families and they had a strong presence in civil administration affairs.[11] All of the Prime Minister of Nepal between 1768 to 1950 were Chhetris with the exception of Ranga Nath Poudyal, being a Brahmin.[12] Bharadars formed consultative body in the kingdom for the most important functions of the state as Councellors, Ministers and Diplomats.[10] There was no single successful coalition government as court politics were driven from large factional rivalries, consecutive conspiracies and ostracization of opponent Bharadar families through assassination rather than legal expulsion.[10] Another reason was the minority of the reigning King between 1777 to 1847 that led to establishment of anarchial rule.[13] The government was stated to have controlled by regents, Mukhtiyars and alliance of political faction with strong fundamental support.[13] In the end of the 18th century, the central politics was regularly dominated by two notable political factions; Thapas and Pandes.[13] Per historians and contemporary writer Francis Hamilton, the government of Nepal[note 2] comprised \\r\\n\\r\\nPer historian Dilli Raman Regmi, the states the government of Nepal were\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1794, King Rana Bahadur Shah came of age and his first act was to re-constitute the government such that his uncle, Prince Bahadur Shah of Nepal, had no official part to play.[14][15] Rana Bahadur appointed Kirtiman Singh Basnyat as Chief (Mul) Kaji among the newly appointed four Kajis though Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji.[15] Kirtiman had succeeded Abhiman Singh Basnyat as Chief Kaji[16] while Prince Bahadur Shah was succeeded as Chief (Mul) Chautariya by Prince Ranodyot Shah, then heir apparent of King Rana Bahadur Shah by a Chhetri Queen Subarna Prabha Devi.[15] Kajis had held the administrative and executive powers of nation after the fall of Chief Chautariya Prince Bahadur Shah in 1794. Later, Kirtiman Singh was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Raj Rajeshwari Devi[17] and his brother Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, was then given the post of Chief (Mul) Kaji.[18] During Bakhtawar's tenure as the Mul Kaji, on 28 October 1801, a Treaty of Commerce and Alliance was signed between Nepal and East India Company.[19] Queen Rajrajeshwari was restored as regent of Nepal in 17 December 1802.[20][21] On subsequent February, Damodar Pande was appointed by Queen Rajrajeshwari as Mulkaji (Chief Kaji)[22] as a reward for establishing her regency.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nHead of state of Nepal (1. 15 January 2007-23 July 2008(2.

The explosion and subsequent fire resulted in the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon and the deaths of 11 workers; 17 others were injured. The same blowout that caused the explosion also caused a massive offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, considered the largest accidental marine oil spill in the world, and the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history.[2][3][4]\\r\\nThe $560 million platform was built by Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea and completed in 2001.[6] It was owned by Transocean, operated under the Marshalese flag of convenience, and was under lease to BP until September 2013.[7] At the time of the explosion, the Deepwater Horizon was on Mississippi Canyon Block 252, referred to as the Macondo Prospect, in the United States sector of the Gulf of Mexico, about 41 miles (66?km) off the Louisiana coast.[8][9][10] In March 2008, the mineral rights to drill for oil on the Macondo Prospect were purchased by BP at the Minerals Management Service's lease sale.[11] The platform commenced drilling in February 2010 at a water depth of approximately 5,000 feet (1,500?m).[12] At the time of the explosion the rig was drilling an exploratory well.[13] The planned well was to be drilled to 18,360 feet (5,600?m) below sea level, and was to be plugged and suspended for subsequent completion as a subsea producer.[12] Production casing was being run and cemented at the time of the accident. Once the cementing was complete, it was due to be tested for integrity and a cement plug set to temporarily abandon the well.[14]\\r\\nThe rig owner, Transocean, had a \\"strong overall\\" safety record with no major incidents for 7 years.[15] However an analysts' review \\"painted a more equivocal picture\\" with Transocean rigs being disproportionately responsible for safety related incidents in the Gulf and industry surveys reporting concerns over falling quality and performance. In the 3 years 2005 to 2007, Transocean was the owner of 30% of oil rigs active in the Gulf, and 33% of incidents that triggered a Minerals Management Service (MMS) investigation were on Transocean rigs. However, in the 3 years from 2008 to February 15, 2010, it owned 42% of rigs but was the owner for 73% of incidents. Industry surveys saw this as an effect of its November 2007 merger with rival GlobalSantaFe. Transocean \\"has had problems\\" previously with both cement seals (2005) and blowout preventers (2006), which are the suspected cause of the Deepwater Horizon loss, although Transocean states that cementing is a third party task and that it has \\"a strong maintenance program to keep blowout preventers working\\".[15] According to the Wall Street Journal online:\\r\\nIn February 2009, BP filed a 52-page exploration and environmental impact plan for the Macondo well with the Minerals Management Service (MMS), an arm of the United States Department of the Interior that oversees offshore drilling. The plan stated that it was \\"unlikely that an accidental surface or subsurface oil spill would occur from the proposed activities\\".[16] In the event an accident did take place, the plan stated that due to the well being 48 miles (77?km) from shore and the response capabilities that would be implemented, no significant adverse impacts would be expected.[16] The Department of the Interior exempted BP's Gulf of Mexico drilling operation from a detailed environmental impact study after concluding that a massive oil spill was unlikely.[17][18] In addition, following a loosening of regulations in 2008, BP was not required to file a detailed blowout plan.[19]\\r\\nThe BP wellhead had been fitted with a blowout preventer (BOP), but it was fitted with remote-control or acoustically activated triggers for use in case of an emergency requiring a platform to be evacuated. It did have a dead man's switch designed to automatically cut the pipe and seal the well if communication from the platform is lost, but it was unknown whether the switch was activated.[20] Documents discussed during congressional hearings June 17, 2010 indicated that Transocean previously made modifications to the BOP for the Macondo site which increased the risk of BOP failure, in spite of warnings from their contractor to that effect. Regulators in both Norway and Brazil generally require acoustically activated triggers on all offshore platforms, but when the Minerals Management Service considered requiring the remote device, a report commissioned by the agency as well as drilling companies questioned its cost and effectiveness.[20] In 2003, the agency determined that the device would not be required because drilling rigs had other back-up systems to cut off a well.[20][21]\\r\\nThe US Coast Guard had issued pollution citations for Deepwater Horizon 18?times between 2000 and 2010, and had investigated 16?fires and other incidents. These incidents were considered typical for a Gulf platform and were not connected to the April 2010 explosion and spill.[22] The Deepwater Horizon had other serious incidents, including one in 2008 in which 77 people were evacuated from the platform when it tilted and began to sink after a section of pipe was incorrectly removed from the platform's ballast system.[23]\\r\\nThe American Bureau of Shipping last inspected the rig's failed blowout preventer in 2005.[24]\\r\\nInternal BP documents show that BP engineers had concerns as early as 2009 that the metal casing that BP wanted to use might collapse under high pressure.[25] According to a number of rig workers, it was understood that workers could get fired for raising safety concerns that might delay drilling.[26]\\r\\nIn March 2010, the rig experienced problems that included drilling mud falling into the undersea oil formation, sudden gas releases, a pipe falling into the well and at least three occasions of the blowout preventer leaking fluid.[25] The rig's mechanic stated that the well had problems for months and that the drill repeatedly kicked due to resistance from high gas pressure.[26] On March 10, a BP executive e-mailed the Minerals Management Service about a stuck pipe and well control situation at the drilling site, and stated that BP would have to plugback the well.[27] A confidential survey commissioned by Transocean weeks before the explosion stated that workers were concerned about safety practices and feared reprisals if they reported mistakes or other problems.[28] The survey raised concerns \\"about poor equipment reliability, which they believed was a result of drilling priorities taking precedence over maintenance.\\" The survey found that \\"many workers entered fake data to try to circumvent the system. As a result, the company's perception of safety on the rig was distorted\\".[29]\\r\\nThe blowout preventer was damaged in a previously unreported accident in late March.[30][31] According to Transocean, workers had been performing standard routines and had no indication of any problems prior to the explosion.[32]\\r\\nBy April 20, the operation was running five weeks late.[26]\\r\\nAn April draft of a BP memo warned that the cementing of the casing was unlikely to be successful.[25] Halliburton has said that it had finished cementing 20?hours before the blowout, but had not yet set the final cement plug.[22][33] A nitrogen-foamed cement was used which is more difficult to handle than standard cement.[34]\\r\\nBP Vice President of drilling, Patrick O'Bryan, was on the platform two hours prior to the explosion[35] to celebrate seven years without a \\"lost-time incident\\" with the rig's crew.[36] A BP official on board the rig directed the crew to replace the drilling mud with lighter seawater even though the rig's chief driller protested.[26]\\r\\nPreliminary findings from BP's internal investigation indicated several serious warning signs in the hours prior to the blowout.[37][38] Equipment readings indicated gas bubbling into the well, which could signal an impending blowout.[25] The heavy drilling mud in the pipes initially held down the gas.[34] A House Energy and Commerce Committee statement in June 2010 noted that in a number of cases leading up to the explosion, BP appears to have chosen riskier procedures to save time or money, sometimes against the advice of its staff or contractors.[39]\\r\\nThe fire aboard the Deepwater Horizon reportedly started at 9:56 p.m. CDT on April 20.[26] At the time, 126 crew were on board: 7 employees of BP, 79 of Transocean, and employees of other companies, including Anadarko, Halliburton and M-I Swaco.[40]\\r\\nTransocean employees on the vessel stated that the electric lights flickered, followed by two strong vibrations. Jim Ingram stated that \\"on the second [thud], we knew something was wrong.\\"[41] After the explosion, Adrian Rose stated that abnormal pressure had accumulated inside the marine riser and as it came up it \\"expanded rapidly and ignited.\\"[14] According to BP's internal investigation, a bubble of methane gas escaped from the well and shot up the drill column, expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding.[42] Rose said the event was basically a blowout.[14] Survivors described the incident as a sudden explosion that gave them less than five minutes to escape as the alarm went off.[43]\\r\\nThe explosion was followed by a fire that engulfed the platform. After burning for more than a day, Deepwater Horizon sank on April 22.[44] The Coast Guard stated on April 22 that they received word of the sinking at approximately 10:21 am.[45]\\r\\nOn September 8, BP published a report that suggested that the ignition source was the released gas entering the air intakes of the diesel generators, and engulfing the deck area where the exhaust outlets for the main generators were emitting hot exhaust gas.[46]\\r\\nAccording to officials, 126?people were on board, of whom 79 were Transocean employees, seven were from BP, and 40 were contracted; several of the BP and Transocean executives were on board for a tour of the rig, maintenance planning, annual goals review, a \\"Drops\\" safety campaign, and to congratulate the senior staff of the rig for 7 years of operations without a lost time incident.[32][47]\\r\\nA total of 115 people were evacuated.[48][49] Lifeboats took 94?workers to the Tidewater-owned supply boat Damon Bankston, with no major injuries, four were transported to another vessel, and 17 were evacuated by helicopter to trauma centers in Mobile, Alabama and Marrero, Louisiana.[32] Most were soon released.[32][50][51]\\r\\nThe Coast Guard interviewed the uninjured workers on the Damon Bankston for several hours and then transferred them to another rig; the workers arrived in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, more than 24 hours later. The workers were transported to a hotel in Kenner, Louisiana, where they were provided with food, medical attention, and rooms with showers, and asked to fill out incident response forms. An attorney for a worker who brought suit against Transocean claimed that once the workers got to shore, \\"they were zipped into private buses, there was security there, there was no press, no lawyers allowed, nothing, no family members\\" and were coerced into signing the forms before being released.[52][53] Transocean responded, in part, as follows:\\r\\n\\"Upon arrival at Port Fourchon, crew members were given an opportunity to leave, however, were encouraged to accept transportation to the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Kenner, Louisiana.\\r\\nCrew members were offered medical care, rooms and opportunity to go home upon arrival at hotel... . Upon arriving at the hotel, crew members were offered the opportunity to meet with qualified medical professionals, to retire to private rooms where they could eat, shower and sleep, or go home. Only then did Transocean and its representatives present crew members with a standard one-page document that asked them to describe where they were at the time of the incident, what they were doing, and to affirm, if true, that they were not a witness and/or that they were not injured. They were free to complete the form at their leisure, or not at all. Some crew members even took the forms home and returned them more than seven days after the incident.\\" [54]\\r\\nInitial reports indicated that between 12 and 15?workers were missing;[55] reports soon narrowed the number of missing to nine crew members on the platform floor and two engineers.[42] The United States Coast Guard immediately launched a rescue operation involving two Coast Guard cutters, four helicopters, and a rescue plane.[56][57] Two of the cutters continued searching through the night. By the morning of April 22, the Coast Guard had surveyed nearly 1,940 square miles (5,000?km2).[48] On April 23, the Coast Guard called off the search for the 11 missing persons, concluding that \\"reasonable expectations of survival\\" had passed.[51][58] Officials concluded that the missing workers may have been near the blast and unable to escape the sudden explosion.[59]\\r\\nThe following eleven individuals died:[60]\\r\\nOn the morning of April 22, Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashley Butler stated that \\"oil was leaking from the rig at the rate of about 8,000 barrels (340,000 US gallons; 1,300,000 litres) of crude per day.\\"[61] That afternoon Coast Guard Senior Chief Petty Officer Michael O'Berry used the same figure. Two remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) were unsuccessfully sent down to attempt to cap the well.[45] Butler warned of a leak of up to 700,000 US gallons (17,000?bbl) of diesel fuel, and BP Vice President David Rainey termed the incident as being a potential \\"major spill.\\"[45] On April 23 a ROV reportedly found no oil leaking from the sunken rig and no oil flowing from the well.[62] Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry expressed cautious optimism of zero environmental impact, stating that no oil was emanating from either the wellhead or the broken pipes and that oil spilled from the explosion and sinking was being contained.[63][64][65][66] On April 24 Landry announced that a damaged wellhead was indeed leaking oil into the Gulf and described it as \\"a very serious spill\\".[67]\\r\\nIn June, the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said BP should have tested cement at the well, which would have cost $128,000 and taken 8ÿ12 hours.\\r\\nOn September 8, 2010, BP released a 193-page report on its web site. The report says BP employees and those of Transocean did not correctly interpret a pressure test, and both companies neglected ominous signs such as a riser pipe losing fluid. It also says that while BP did not listen to recommendations by Halliburton for more centralizers (devices to keep the casing from contacting the bore hole[68]), the lack of centralizers probably did not affect the cement. BP also said the crew should have redirected the flow of flammable gases. The blowout preventer, removed on September 4, had not reached a NASA facility in time for it to be part of the report. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed \\"BP's fatally flawed well design.\\"[69]\\r\\nOn November 8, 2010, the inquiry by the Oil Spill Commission revealed its findings that BP had not sacrificed safety in attempts to make money, but that some decisions had increased risks on the rig.[70] However, the panel said a day later that there had been \\"a rush to completion\\" on the well, criticizing poor management decisions. \\"There was not a culture of safety on that rig,\\" co-chair Bill Reilly said.[71] One of the decisions that met with tough questions was that BP refuted the findings of advanced modelling software that had ascertained over three times as many centralizers were needed on the rig. It also decided not to rerun the software when it stuck with only six centralizers, and ignored or misread warnings from other key tests, the panel revealed.[72]\\r\\nA slide briefly appeared on the Oil Spill Commissions website which enumerated eight risky and unnecessary steps that BP was deemed to have taken. The New York Times newspaper has published a screenshot of the slide here.[73][74]\\r\\nA review of seven reports[which?] on the causes of the blowout indicates that six operations, tests, or equipment functions went wrong in the final 32 hours:\\r\\n1. Small diameter hole obstructed dirt circulation. The 18,300-foot, 400-ton casing string had a 5,800-foot lower portion with a 7-inch diameter. Most of the hole over this portion of casing had a 9.875 inch diameter. However, the lowest 180 feet of 7-inch casing with 4 equally spaced centralizers were squeezed into an 8.5-inch hole with only 56 feet of rathole clearance (space between the lower end of the casing string and the bottom of the drilled hole). Compressed sediment and granular infill in the 0.75-inch wide annulus (Halliburtons best practices document recommends 1.5 to 2-inch annular gap tolerance) most probably explains the need for a much-higher-than-normal pressure of 3142 psi to liquefy it (on the ninth attempt) and allow mud to circulate. The unexpectedly high pressure and subsequent lower-than-specified mud flow led to problems 2 and 3.\\r\\n2. Valves to prevent cement backflow did not close. Weatherfords Auto-Fill float collar, which includes two flapper-type check valves, was installed at Macondo 180?ft above the reamer shoe at casing bottom. The valves are held open by a 2-inch diameter auto-fill tube to allow the casing to fill with mud while it is lowered down the well. BPs casing installation procedure stated: \\"slowly increase (mud) pump rates greater than 8 bpm to convert the float equipment (~ 500 ÿ 700 psi) per Weatherford recommendation\\".[75] As the flow rate drag force during circulation and cementing was only around 30% of that required, the auto-fill tube was almost certainly not ejected and the flapper valves never closed. Some evidence suggests that personnel on the Deepwater Horizon mistakenly believed that the high pressure needed to establish mud circulation had converted the float collar.\\r\\n3. Cementing inadequate. Cementing proceeded a) without flushing the annulus around the shoe track at sufficiently high rate and duration to ensure full circumferential removal of compressed sediment and good distribution of cement, and b) without converting the float collar to activate its two check valves to prevent cement backflow. Cement quality and strength may have been reduced by contamination on its way down the casing, or by mixing with lower density mud in the rathole. There was no cementing evaluation log at Macondo, which may have shown it to be inadequate.\\r\\n4. Pressure test wrongly interpreted. Drill pipe was run to 8,367?ft ready for mud displacement. During the \\"negative pressure test\\", for which there was no detailed procedure, no flow from the kill line was accepted and 1,400 psi on the drill pipe was ignored.\\r\\n5. Rising oil and gas not monitored. While displacing the mud with seawater, reservoir fluids rising up the casing should have been detected by water inflow and mud outflow monitoring before arrival of hydrocarbons at the rig floor, but no reasonably accurate outflow versus inflow observations were made.\\r\\n6. Fail-safe on seabed wellhead was unable to close. After uncontrolled arrival of oil and gas at the rig floor, the blind-shear rams in the BOP stack failed to close due to the presence of off-center drill pipe.\\r\\nOn April 21, 2011, BP filed $40 billion worth of lawsuits against rig owner Transocean, cementer Halliburton and blowout-preventer manufacturer Cameron. The oil firm alleged that failed safety systems and irresponsible behaviour of contractors had led to the explosion, including claims that Halliburton \\"negligently\\" failed to use cement-modelling software OptiCem properly to analyze safe well requirements. Part of the modelling concern was about the number of stabilising devices, known as centralisers, the well required: 21 called for v. 6 used.[76]\\r\\nIn May 2011, MOEX Offshore, which owned a 10% stake in the well through a subsidiary and which in turn itself was majority-owned by Mitsui & Co., agreed to pay US$1.07 billion to settle BP claims against it over the accident. Some analysts had thought BP would realize a larger settlement from MOEX but there was also relief to have a first step toward resolving the multiple claims. BPs most recent estimate at the time was that the spill would cost $41.3 billion. Anadarko Petroleum held a 25% stake in the Macondo well and was an immediate focus of attention with MOEX's agreement. Also the Department of Justice was still at the time investigating whether BP was \\"grossly negligent\\" in the spill. Such a determination could lead to a \\"much larger liability under the Clean Water Act, a financial analyst said. With MOEX agreeing to share in the financial burdenthough \\"the agreement isnt an admission of liability by either party\\"the possibility of such a ruling by the Department of Justice seemed to some to be perhaps lessened.[77]\\r\\nIn June 2011, supplier Weatherford International settled with BP for $75 million.[78]\\r\\nIn October 2011, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation agreed to pay BP $4 billion and the two companies settled all claims between them.[79] Anadarko yielded its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo) to BP in the agreement and BP will indemnify Anadarko for damage claims arising under the U.S. Oil Pollution Act, among other costs.[80]\\r\\nIn December 2011, Cameron International agreed to pay a $250 million settlement to BP PLC to settle all claims related to the Deepwater Horizon with neither party admitting responsibility. \\"BP still has not reached a settlement with Transocean ... nor Halliburton.... A trial date over lawsuits related to the accident awaits BP in February (2013)\\", the update continued.[81]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against it over the Deepwater spill by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years.[82]\\r\\nOn September 4, 2014, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct under the Clean Water Act (CWA). He described BP's actions as \\"reckless,\\" while he said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were \\"negligent.\\" He apportioned 67% of the blame for the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton. Fines would be apportioned commensurate with the degree of negligence of the parties, measured against the number of barrels of oil spilled. Under the Clean Water Act fines can be based on a cost per barrel of up to $4,300, at the discretion of the judge. The number of barrels was in dispute at the conclusion of the trial with BP arguing 2.5 million barrels were spilled over the 87 days the spill lasted, while the court found that 4.2 million barrels were spilled. BP issued a statement disagreeing with the finding, and saying the court's decision would be appealed.[83]\\r\\nIn July 2015 BP reached an $18.7bn settlement with the US government, the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, as well as 400 local authorities. To date BPs cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54bn.[84]\\r\\nDeepwater Horizon is a 2016 film based on the explosion directed by Peter Berg and starring Mark Wahlberg.[85] The event was also featured on the 24 June 2012 pilot episode of the HBO television series The Newsroom.","input":"What was the cause of the deepwater horizon oil spill?"},{"output":"Gloucester House, Piccadilly, London","context":"Hard Rock Cafe Inc. is a chain of theme restaurants founded in 1971 by Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton in London. In 1979, the cafe began covering its walls with rock and roll memorabilia, a tradition which expanded to others in the chain. In 2007, Hard Rock was sold to the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and since then it is headquartered in Orlando, Florida.[1][2] As of December 2015, there were 191 Hard Rock locations in 59 countries, including 168 cafes, 23 hotels, and 11 casinos.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) opened on June 14, 1971 at Gloucester House, Piccadilly, London, under the ownership of young Americans Peter Morton and Isaac Tigrett. Hard Rock initially had an eclectic decor but it later started to display memorabilia.\\r\\nThe chain began to expand worldwide in 1982 with locations in (among others) Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Paris, and Berlin.[4] Hard Rock Cafe locations in the United States vary from smaller, more tourist driven markets (Biloxi, Pigeon Forge, Key West, etc.) to large metropolises (Houston, Philadelphia, New York City, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, etc.). Hard Rock Cafe typically does not franchise cafe locations in the United States. All US cafes are corporate owned and operated, except for cafes in Tampa and Four Winds New Buffalo casino.[5] However, in the transition of the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel property originally owned and then later sold to Rank by founder Peter Morton. Morton retained hotel naming rights west of the Mississippi. When Morton sold his Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel to the Morgans Hotel Group, he also sold those naming rights, which then gave rise to two US franchised hotels (without cafes) in Albuquerque and Tulsa. The Albuquerque hotel no longer pays for the Hard Rock rights and reverted to its former name in June 2013. More hotels franchised from Morgan's are planned for Sioux City and Vancouver.\\r\\nIn 1990, The Rank Group, a London-based leisure company, acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory. Rank went on to purchase Hard Rock America from Peter Morton as well as Hard Rock Canada from Nick Bitove. After the completion of these acquisitions, Rank gained worldwide control of the brand. In March 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired Hard Rock Cafe International, Inc. and other related entities from Rank for US$965 million.[1] In 2008, anonymous members of the wait staff criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK, with the business allocating tips to staff to bring their salaries within the law. Most customers, it was argued, do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip.[6]\\r\\nHRC is known for its collection of rock and roll memorabilia. The cafes solicit donations of music memorabilia but also purchase a number of items at auctions around the world, including autographed guitars, costumes from world tours and rare photographs; these are often to be found mounted on cafe walls. The collection began in 1979 with an un-signed Red Fender Lead II guitar from Eric Clapton, who was a regular at the first restaurant in London. Clapton wanted management to hang the guitar over his regular seat in order to lay claim to that spot, and they obliged. This prompted Pete Townshend of The Who to give one of his guitars, also un-signed with the note \\"Mine's as good as his! Love, Pete.\\"[7] Hard Rock's archive includes over 80,000 items,[8] and is the largest private collection of Rock and Roll memorabilia in the world. Marquee pieces from the collection were briefly displayed in a Hard Rock museum named \\"The Vault\\" in Orlando, Florida from January 2003 until September 2004. After the closure, items were disbursed to various restaurant locations.[9] The London Vault remains open and free to visitors, located in the retail Rock Shop of the original cafe.[10]\\r\\nThe Hard Rock Caf is also in possession of a Bedford VAL 6 axle coach used in the 1967 film The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour. The vehicle was completely refurbished after filming. It is currently displayed in the US, but makes regular appearances in events in the UK, especially at the original Hard Rock Cafe in London. In 2001, a competition was run to win the actual bus, but it was never given away and remained with the cafe.\\r\\nIn 1995, Peter Morton spent $80 million to open the Hard Rock Hotel near the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. A subsequent $100 million expansion in 1999 nearly doubled the hotel's capacity.[11]\\r\\nIn May 2006, Morton sold the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas to Morgans Hotel Group for $770 million, including the rights to the Hard Rock Hotel brand west of the Mississippi, including Texas, California, Australia, and Vancouver, British Columbia.[12] The hotel began another expansion in 2007 at a cost of $750 million. The project added 875 rooms in two towers and expanded meeting space.[13] In March 2011, Morgans surrendered control of the property to partner Brookfield Asset Management, citing the high debt on the property in the face of the economic downturn.[14]\\r\\nToday, the Seminole Tribe of Florida owns and operates all units except the Las Vegas, Tulsa, Sioux City, and Vancouver properties. In 2004, Hard Rock International and Sol Melia Hotels and Resorts launched Lifestar Hoteles Espa?a SL, a joint venture that intended to manage Europe's first Hard Rock Hotel in Madrid, but it was never opened as a Hard Rock property upon the dissolution of the joint venture in 2007.[15] The other joint venture hotels are in Chicago, New York and San Diego (the San Diego property includes Hard Rock condominiums). Hard Rock also operates hotels and resorts in Orlando, Florida (a joint venture with Loews Hotels); Bali, Indonesia; and Pattaya, Thailand, (a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited). Hard Rock International continues to expand internationally (including hotels, casinos, resorts, and condominiums) through several joint ventures (Becker Ventures, Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited and Loews Hotels), including hotels in Chicago, Bali, Orlando, Penang, San Diego, Singapore, and planned openings in Abu Dhabi, Cancun, Dubai, Hungary, Panama, Punta Cana and Vallarta[16] - as well as hotel-casinos in Hollywood, Florida; Tampa, Florida; Biloxi, Mississippi; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Tulsa Catoosa, Oklahoma.[17]\\r\\nThe Hotel Zoso in Palm Springs, California was converted into a 160-room Hard Rock Hotel and opened in 2014.[18][19] A location in Atlantic City, New Jersey was planned but canceled.[20] All-inclusive resorts operate under the Hard Rock brand in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In 2013, the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park, opened as joint slot machine and track venture. The Rocksino is located near Cleveland.\\r\\nIn 2015 Hard Rock announced the opening of a new and Inclusive Hotel located in Bogot, Colombia, who will start the construction in 2018 and opens in 2019, the company had its plans to open in the biggest financial district in Colombia, the Centro Internacional, but finally and with all the plans the Hotel will be located in the exclusive zone of Zona Rosa de Bogot, home of boutiques from Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana, Versace among others, the Hotel will be located in the Heart of the zone, In the top floor of the exclusive mall, El Retiro Shopping Mall with exclusive brands including Swarovski, Mango, Maybelline and one of the most expensive restaurants in Colombia, The Andrs D.C..\\r\\nOn March 1, 2017, Hard Rock announced plans to spend $300 million to purchase and renovate the closed Trump Taj Mahal resort for a summer 2018 re-opening as the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City.[21]\\r\\nInternational locations include\\r\\nIn March 2006, Hard Rock Cafe International announced that it had licensed the \\"Hard Rock\\" name to HRP Myrtle Beach Operations, LLC, to design, build, and operate a $400 million 150-acre (0.61?km2) theme park called Hard Rock Park. Hard Rock Park opened on April 15, 2008 in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The park was expected to draw an estimated 30,000 visitors per day, promised to create more than 3,000 jobs, and was billed as the largest single investment in South Carolina's history. It planned to feature a large concert arena and six zones with more than 40 attractions. HRP Myrtle Beach Operations, LLC, filed for Chapter 11 on September 25, 2008. The company hoped to re-open in 2009 after restructuring.[22] On January 2, 2009 after failing to attract a buyer with a minimum $35 million bid for over two months, Hard Rock Park asked a Delaware Bankruptcy Court to convert the filing to Chapter 7, triggering immediate liquidation of assets to pay off creditors, and closing the park.[23]\\r\\nNew owners renamed the venue Freestyle Music Park and planned to reopen retaining a music-theme but, without the Hard Rock name by Memorial Day, 2009. The park only operated one additional year and never reopened due to poor attendance.[24]\\r\\nIn August 2016, it has been reported that the NFL will announce the Miami Dolphins' stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida will be renamed Hard Rock Stadium;[25] ironically, the stadium's other high-profile tenant, the University of Miami's football team, has no greater rival than Florida State, whose athletic teams are, with the tribe's blessing, known as the \\"Seminoles\\".\\r\\nOn December 7, 2006, Rank sold its Hard Rock business to the Seminole Tribe of Florida for $965 million. Included in the deal were 124 Hard Rock Cafes, four Hard Rock Hotels, two Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hotels, two Hard Rock Live! concert venues, and stakes in three unbranded hotels. Rank retained the Hard Rock Casino in London, and rebranded it the G Casino Piccadilly. The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas was also not part of the deal, as it was sold by Peter Morton to Morgans Hotel Group in May 2006.[26] The final takeover was mired in controversy, due to a payment clause in a contract with one casino developer, Power Plant Entertainment. Power Plant and the Seminoles announced a settlement in April 2007 which both sides called equitable.[27] On January 8, 2007, Rank shareholders approved the Seminoles' $965 million offer. The Tribe announced it had finalized the deal on March 11, 2007.[28]\\r\\nOn June 22, 2008, the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Hollywood began \\"Vegas-style\\" table gambling in addition to the Class II slots already in operation. To win approval for the table games, which were barred under Florida law, the Seminole Tribe paid the State of Florida $100 million as part of a 25-year pact signed by Governor Charlie Crist. On July 3, 2008, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the governor's agreement was unconstitutional, but table games continue to operate because the Federal Department of the Interior approved the now-invalid pact with the state.[29]\\r\\n Media related to Hard Rock Cafe at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Where was the first hard rock cafe established?"},{"output":"10 December 1948","context":"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document that was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at its third session on?10 December 1948 as Resolution 217 at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, France. Of the then 58 members of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained, and two did not vote.\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of 30 articles affirming an individual's rights which, although not legally binding in themselves, have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, economic transfers, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The Declaration was the first step in the process of formulating the International Bill of Human Rights, which was completed in 1966, and came into force in 1976, after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them.\\r\\nSome legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the Declaration for more than 50 years, it has become binding as a part of customary international law.[1][2] However, in the United States, the Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain (2004), concluded that the Declaration \\"does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law.\\"[3] Courts of other countries have also concluded that the Declaration is not in and of itself part of domestic law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underlying structure of the Universal Declaration was introduced in its second draft, which was prepared by Ren Cassin. Cassin worked from a first draft, which was prepared by John Peters Humphrey. The structure was influenced by the Code Napolon, including a preamble and introductory general principles.[4] Cassin compared the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a pediment.\\r\\nThe Declaration consists of a preamble and thirty articles:\\r\\nThese articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.[6]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the Allies adopted the Four Freedomsfreedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from fear, and freedom from wantas their basic war aims.[7][8] The United Nations Charter \\"reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights, and dignity and worth of the human person\\" and committed all member states to promote \\"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\\".[9]\\r\\nWhen the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany became fully apparent after World War II, the consensus within the world community was that the United Nations Charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred.[10][11] A universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the Charter's provisions on human rights.[12]\\r\\nIn June 1946, the UN Economic and Social Council established the Commission on Human Rights, comprising 18 members from various nationalities and political backgrounds. The Commission, a standing body of the United Nations, was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an International Bill of Rights.[13]\\r\\nThe Commission established a special Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, to write the articles of the Declaration. The Committee met in two sessions over the course of two years.\\r\\nCanadian John Peters Humphrey, Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat, was called upon by the United Nations Secretary-General to work on the project and became the Declaration's principal drafter.[14] At the time, Humphrey was newly appointed as Director of the Division of Human Rights within the United Nations Secretariat.[15]\\r\\nOther well-known members of the drafting committee included Ren Cassin of France, Charles Malik of Lebanon, and P. C. Chang of the Republic of China (Taiwan).[16] Humphrey provided the initial draft which became the working text of the Commission.\\r\\nAccording to Allan Carlson, the Declaration's pro-family phrases were the result of the Christian Democratic movement's influence on Cassin and Malik.[17]\\r\\nOnce the Committee finished its work in May 1948, the draft was further discussed by the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council, the Third Committee of the General Assembly before being put to vote in December 1948. During these discussions many amendments and propositions were made by UN Member States.[18]\\r\\nBritish representatives were extremely frustrated that the proposal had moral but no legal obligation.[19] (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.)\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration was adopted by the General Assembly as Resolution 217 on 10?December 1948. Of the then 58 members[20] of the United Nations, 48 voted in favor, none against, eight abstained[21][22] and Honduras and Yemen failed to vote or abstain.[23]\\r\\nThe meeting record[24] provides firsthand insight into the debate. South Africa's position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid, which clearly violated several articles in the Declaration.[21] The Saudi Arabian delegation's abstention was prompted primarily by two of the Declaration's articles: Article 18, which states that everyone has the right \\"to change his religion or belief\\"; and Article 16, on equal marriage rights.[21] The six communist countries abstentions centred around the view that the Declaration did not go far enough in condemning fascism and Nazism.[25] Eleanor Roosevelt attributed the abstention of Soviet bloc countries to Article 13, which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries.[26]\\r\\nThe 48 countries which voted in favour of the Declaration are:[27]\\r\\n8 countries abstained:[27]\\r\\nOther countries only gained sovereignty and joined the United Nations later,[29] which explains the relatively small number of states entitled to the historical vote, and in no way reflects opposition to the universal principles.\\r\\nThe Declaration of Human Rights Day is commemorated every year on?December 10, the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration, and is known as Human Rights Day or International Human Rights Day. The commemoration is observed by individuals, community and religious groups, human rights organizations, parliaments, governments, and the United Nations. Decadal commemorations are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the Declaration and human rights. 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the Declaration, and was accompanied by year-long activities around the theme \\"Dignity and justice for all of us\\".[30]\\r\\nIn 1948, the UN Resolution A/RES/217(III)[A] adopted the Declaration on a bilingual document in English and French, and official translations in Chinese, Russian and Spanish.[31] In 2009, the Guinness Book of Records described the Declaration as the world's \\"Most Translated Document\\" (370 different languages and dialects).[32][33] The Unicode Consortium stores 431[34] of the 503[35] official translations available at the OHCHR (as of June?2017[update]).\\r\\nIn its preamble, governments commit themselves and their people to progressive measures which secure the universal and effective recognition and observance of the human rights set out in the Declaration. Eleanor Roosevelt supported the adoption of the Declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the United States Declaration of Independence had within the United States.[citation needed] In this, she proved to be correct. Even though it is not legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or has influenced most national constitutions since 1948. It has also served as the foundation for a growing number of national laws, international laws, and treaties, as well as for a growing number of regional, sub national, and national institutions protecting and promoting human rights.\\r\\nFor the first time in international law, the term the rule of law was used in the preamble of the Declaration. The third paragraph of the preamble of the Declaration reads as follows: \\"Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\\"[36]\\r\\nWhile not a treaty itself, the Declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words \\"fundamental freedoms\\" and \\"human rights\\" appearing in the United Nations Charter, which is binding on all member states. For this reason, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a fundamental constitutive document of the United Nations. In addition, many international lawyers[37][38][39][40] believe that the Declaration forms part of customary international law[41] and is a powerful tool in applying diplomatic and moral pressure to governments that violate any of its articles. The 1968 United Nations International Conference on Human Rights advised that the Declaration \\"constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community\\" to all persons. The Declaration has served as the foundation for two binding UN human rights covenants: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The principles of the Declaration are elaborated in international treaties such as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and many more. The Declaration continues to be widely cited by governments, academics, advocates, and constitutional courts, and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights.\\r\\nThe Universal Declaration has received praise from a number of notable people. The Lebanese philosopher and diplomat Charles Malik called it \\"an international document of the first order of importance\\",[42] while Eleanor Rooseveltfirst chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) that drafted the Declarationstated that it \\"may well become the international Magna Carta of all men everywhere.\\"[43] In a speech on 5 October 1995, Pope John Paul II called the Declaration \\"one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time\\" but the Vatican never adopted the Declaration.[44] In a statement on 10 December 2003 on behalf of the European Union, Marcello Spatafora said that the Declaration \\"placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the international community.\\"[45]\\r\\nTurkey which was a secular state with an overwhelmingly Muslim populationsigned the Declaration in 1948.[46] However, the same year, Saudi Arabia abstained from the ratification vote on the Declaration, claiming that it violated Sharia law.[47] Pakistanwhich had signed the declarationdisagreed and critiqued the Saudi position.[48] Pakistani minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan strongly argued in favor of including freedom of religion.[49] In 1982, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, said that the Declaration was \\"a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition\\" which could not be implemented by Muslims without conflict with Sharia.[50] On 30 June 2000, members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam,[51] an alternative document that says people have \\"freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari'ah\\", without any discrimination on grounds of \\"race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations\\".\\r\\nSome Muslim diplomats would go on later to help draft other UN human rights treaties. For example, Iraqi diplomat Bedia Afnan's insistence on wording that recognized gender equality resulted in Article 3 within the ICCPR and ICESCR. Pakistani diplomat Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah also spoke in favor of recognizing women's rights.[49]\\r\\nA number of scholars in different fields have expressed concerns with the Declaration's alleged Western bias. These include Irene Oh, Abdulaziz Sachedina, Riffat Hassan, and Faisal Kutty. Hassan has argued:\\r\\nWhat needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be the highest, or sole, model, of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings, is that given the Western origin and orientation of this Declaration, the \\"universality\\" of the assumptions on which it is based is?ÿ at the very least?ÿ problematic and subject to questioning. Furthermore, the alleged incompatibility between the concept of human rights and religion in general, or particular religions such as Islam, needs to be examined in an unbiased way.[52]\\r\\nIrene Oh argues that one solution is to approach the issue from the perspective of comparative (descriptive) ethics.[53]\\r\\nKutty writes: \\"A strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home ... It is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conceptions of human rights.\\"[54]\\r\\nIronically, a number of Islamic countries that as of 2014[update] are among the most resistant to UN intervention in domestic affairs, played an invaluable role in the creation of the Declaration, with countries such as Syria and Egypt having been strong proponents of the universality of human rights and the right of countries to self-determination.[55]\\r\\nGroups such as Amnesty International[56] and War Resisters International[57] have advocated for \\"The Right to Refuse to Kill\\" to be added to the Universal Declaration. War Resisters International has stated that the right to conscientious objection to military service is primarily derived frombut not yet explicit inArticle 18 of the UDHR: the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.[57]\\r\\nSteps have been taken within the United Nations to make this right more explicit, butto date (2017)[update]those steps have been limited to less significant United Nations documents. Sean MacBrideAssistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and Nobel Peace Prize laureatehas said: \\"To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is 'The Right to Refuse to Kill'.\\"[58]\\r\\nThe American Anthropological Association criticized the UDHR while it was in its drafting process. The AAA warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a Western paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope. They further argued that the West's history of colonialism and evangelism made them a problematic moral representative for the rest of the world. They proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of cultural relativism: \\"1. The individual realizes his personality through his culture, hence respect for individual differences entails a respect for cultural differences\\", \\"2. Respect for differences between cultures is validated by the scientific fact that no technique of qualitatively evaluating cultures has been discovered\\", and \\"3. Standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formulate postulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent detract from the applicability of any Declaration of Human Rights to mankind as a whole.\\"[59]\\r\\nDuring the lead up to the World Conference on Human Rights held in 1993, ministers from Asian states adopted the Bangkok Declaration, reaffirming their governments' commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They stated their view of the interdependence and indivisibility of human rights and stressed the need for universality, objectivity, and non-selectivity of human rights. However, at the same time, they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and non-interference, calling for greater emphasis on economic, social, and cultural rightsin particular, the right to economic development over civil and political rights. The Bangkok Declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the Asian values perspective, which offers an extended critique of human rights universalism.[60]\\r\\nThe International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) is nonpartisan, nonsectarian, and independent of any government, and its core mandate is to promote respect for all the rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.[61][62]\\r\\nIn 1988, director Stephen R. Johnson and 41 international animators, musicians, and producers created a 20-minute video for Amnesty International to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration. The video was to bring to life the Declaration's 30 articles.[63]\\r\\nAmnesty International celebrated Human Rights Day and the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration all over the world by organizing the \\"Fire Up!\\" event.[64]\\r\\nThe Unitarian Universalist Service Committee (UUSC) is a non-profit, nonsectarian organization whose work around the world is guided by the values of Unitarian Universalism and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It works to provide disaster relief and promote human rights and social justice around the world.\\r\\nThe Quaker United Nations Office and the American Friends Service Committee work on many human rights issues, including improving education on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They have developed a Curriculum to help introduce High School students to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[65][66]\\r\\nIn 1997, the council of the American Library Association (ALA) endorsed Article 19 from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.[67] Along with Article 19, Article 18 and 20 are also fundamentally tied to the ALA Universal Right to Free Expression and the Library Bill of Rights.[68] Censorship, the invasion of privacy, and interference of opinions are human rights violations according to the ALA.\\r\\nIn response to violations of human rights, the ALA asserts the following principles:\\r\\nThe American Library Association condemns any governmental effort to involve libraries and librarians in restrictions on the right of any individual to hold opinions without interference, and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. Such restrictions, whether enforced by statutes or regulations, contractual stipulations, or voluntary agreements, pervert the function of the library and violate the professional responsibilities of librarians.\\r\\nThe American Library Association rejects censorship in any form. Any action that denies the inalienable human rights of individuals only damages the will to resist oppression, strengthens the hand of the oppressor, and undermines the cause of justice.\\r\\nThe American Library Association will not abrogate these principles. We believe that censorship corrupts the cause of justice, and contributes to the demise of freedom.\\r\\n[69]\\r\\nYouth for Human Rights International (YHRI) is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 by Mary Shuttleworth, an educator born and raised in apartheid South Africa, where she witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of discrimination and the lack of basic human rights. The purpose of YHRI is to teach youth about human rights, specifically the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and inspire them to become advocates for tolerance and peace. YHRI has now grown into a global movement, including hundreds of groups, clubs and chapters around the world.[70]","input":"When was universal declaration of human rights adopted?"},{"output":"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se?ora la Reina de los ngeles","context":"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se?ora la Reina de los ngeles (the Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels) was the Spanish civilian pueblo founded in 1781, which by the 20th century became the American metropolis of Los Angeles.\\r\\nOfficial settlements in Alta California were of three types: presidio (military), mission (religious) and pueblo (civil). The Pueblo de los ngeles was the second pueblo (town) created during the Spanish colonization of California (the first was San Jose, in 1777). El Pueblo de la Reina de los ngeles'The Town of the Queen of Angels'[1] was founded twelve years after the first presidio and mission, the Presidio of San Diego and the Mission San Diego de Alcal (1769). The original settlement consisted of forty-four people in eleven families, recruited mostly from Estado de Occidente. As new settlers arrived and soldiers retired to civilian life in Los Angeles, the town became the principal urban center of southern Alta California, whose social and economic life revolved around the raising of livestock on the expansive ranchos.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1542 Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo, with a commission from Viceroy Antonio de Mendoza, was the first European to sail along and explore the California coast. Although he claimed all he saw as territory of the Spanish Empire, no efforts at colonization were made for over two hundred years. Concerned about colonizing efforts by the Russians and French, Spain set plans in motion in the 1760s to establish a presence and defend its claim to the territory.\\r\\nThe Spanish settlement did not reach Alta California until 1769, when explorer Gaspar de Portol reached the San Diego area via the first land route from Mexico. Accompanying him were two Franciscan Padres, Junpero Serra and Juan Cresp, who recorded the expedition. As they came through today's Elysian Park, they were awed by a river that flowed from the northwest, past their point and on southward. Cresp named the river El Ro de Nuestra Se?ora la Reina de los ngeles de Porci~ncula, meaning, in Spanish, \\"the River of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of Porciuncula\\".[2] The name derives from Santa Maria degli Angeli (Italian: \\"St. Mary of the Angels\\") which is the name of the small town in Italy housing the Porciuncula, the church where St. Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan order, carried out his religious life. The river that was called the Porciuncula is today's Los Angeles River. Because the future town's name was a take on this \\"Queen of Heaven\\" Marian title, various versions of Cresp's formula would be used for the town, including the exceedingly long El Pueblo de Nuestra Se?ora la Reina de los ngeles sobre el Ro Porci~ncula.[3]\\r\\nDuring the expedition, Father Cresp observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the Mission San Gabriel Arcngel-San Gabriel Mission near the present day Whittier Narrows section of the San Gabriel River. The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Cresp's location on the Ro Porci~ncula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San Jos de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \\"Nueva California.\\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.\\r\\nGovernor de Neve took his assignment seriously and had a complete set of maps and plans drawn up by May 1780 for the layout and settlement of the new pueblo, including the placement of government houses, town houses, the church, the fields, the farms, and access to the river ÿ the Instrucci܇n and the Reglamento para el gobierno de la Provincia de Californias.[4] But gathering the pobladores-settlers was a little more difficult. After failing to recruit the target number of families in Sonora, he had to go as far as Sinaloa to finally end up with 11 families, that is, 11 men, 11 women, and 22 children of various Spanish American castes: Criollo, Mulatto and Negro.[5]\\r\\nAs local lore tells it, on September 4, 1781 the 44 pobladores gathered at San Gabriel Mission and, escorted by a military detachment and two priests from the Mission, set out for the site that Cresp had chosen. In reality, several of the families were probably already working on their plots of land as early as late July.[6] Governor de Neve gave the new town the name El Pueblo de la Reina de los ngeles-The Town of the Queen of the Angels. Per the Laws of the Indies and Reglamento the new towns in Alta California were to have four square leagues of land; that is a distance marked by one league in each cardinal direction from the town center.[7] The streets, however, were laid out at forty-five degrees from the cardinal directions, a plan which is still preserved in Downtown Los Angeles.[8] The old town limits are still marked by Hoover and Indiana Streets in the west and east respectively. In 1784 an asistencia or sub-mission of the San Gabriel Mission was established on the central plaza, to provide religious services to the settlers.\\r\\nThe pueblo came under the jurisdiction of the Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. As a pueblo, Los Angeles was granted a cabildo (town council). The first municipal officers, the regidores (council members) and alcalde (municipal magistrate), were appointed by Governor de Neve. Subsequent ones were elected annually by the settlers, the vecinos pobladores. Since the government of Las Californias had a strong military orientation in this early phase of colonization, the civilian cabildo was originally supervised by a commisionado (commissioner) appointed by the comandante (commander) of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, who was charged with making sure the alcalde and regidores carried out their duties correctly. The first commisionado was Jos Vicente Feliz, one of the soldiers who accompanied the original 44 settlers to the pueblo.[9] The first recorded alcalde was Jos Vanegas, who served in 1786 and 1796. Vanegas was first listed as an Indian in the original 1781 padr܇n (register) but then as a Mestizo in the 1790 census.[10] The next few alcaldes reflected the mixed population of the small settlement: Jos Sinova, a Criollo, 1789; Mariano de la Luz Verdugo, a Criollo, 1790; and Juan Francisco Reyes, a Mulatto, 1793. Among the first regidores were Felipe Santiago Garca (a Criollo) and Manuel Camero (a Mulatto in the 1781 padr܇n, and a Mestizo in 1790 census). In judicial affairs, both military and civil cases were appealed to the Audiencia of Guadalajara.[11]\\r\\nOn August 18, 1814 Fray Luis Gl y Taboada placed the cornerstone of a new Franciscan church amidst the ruins of the original asistencia. The completed structure was dedicated on December 8, 1822.[12] A replacement chapel, named La Iglesia de Nuestra Se?ora de los ngeles (The Church of Our Lady of the Angels) was rebuilt utilizing materials of the original church in 1861. The term Reina (queen) was added later to reconcile the church's name with that of the town.[13] The small chapel, also called \\"La Placita\\" and \\"the Plaza Church,\\" served the total Californio and immigrant Roman Catholic community as the only church in the vicinity of the City of Los Angeles until the 1876 construction of the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana. Saint Vibiana Cathedral became the English-speaking parish and La Placita became the Spanish-speaking parish.[14] \\"The Plaza Church\\" still stands today, exhibiting Spanish Colonial and Carpenter Gothic architectural styles.\\r\\nThe Los Angeles parish was under the Diocese of Sonora until 1840, when a new Diocese of the Two Californias was established to serve the Baja California Peninsula and Alta California. Both the dioceses of Sonara and the Two Californias were suffragan of the Archdiocese of Mexico.\\r\\nAfter Mexico's War of Independence (1810ÿ1821) from Spain was won, life began to change in Los Angeles and Alta California . With the secularization of the missions, their land was distributed for the establishment of many more ranchos. The Native population was displaced or absorbed into the Hispanic population.\\r\\nBeginning about 1827, Los Angeles, now the largest pueblo of the territory, became a rival of Monterey for the honor of being the capital of California; was the seat of conspiracies to overthrow the Mexican authority; and the stronghold of the South California party in the bickering and struggles that lasted down to the American occupation.\\r\\nIn about 1834, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. visited San Pedro Harbor as a sailor. His book, Two Years Before the Mast, includes a brief depiction of the pueblo and area, then dependent on the export of cattle hides and tallow. In 1835 it was made a city by the Mexican Congress, and declared the capital, but the last provision was not enforced and was soon recalled. In 1836ÿ1838, it was the headquarters of Carlos Antonio Carrillo, a legally named but never de facto governor of California, whose jurisdiction was never recognized in the north; and, in 1845ÿ1847, it was the actual capital.\\r\\nIn 1842, a sheep rancher, pausing under an oak tree, discovered gold in Placerita Canyon in Rancho San Francisco, just north of the city sparking a minor gold rush. In subsequent decades local mining employed hard rock and placer techniques. Land however turned out to be the more \\"profitable gold\\", as ranching and development expanded as the town and region grew.\\r\\nManifest Destiny reached California at the time of the Mexican-American War (1846ÿ1848). On June 18, 1846 a small group of Yankees raised the California Bear Flag and declared independence from Mexico in the Bear Flag Revolt in Northern California. United States troops then took control of the presidios at Monterey and San Francisco, and proclaimed the invading \\"conquest\\" complete. In Southern California, the Mexican citizens repelled American troops for 5 months, utilizing about 160 vaqueros against about 700 American forces.\\r\\nLos Angeles initially surrendered to the surprise invasion by United States forces. The small Mexican forces of Los Angeles fled at the approach of US troops, and August 13, 1846 the American flag was raised over the city. A garrison of fifty US Marines under Archibald Gillespie was left in control. The city's population had been rent by factional quarrels when war broke out between Mexico and the United States, but the occupation caused both factions to unite against the invading Americans. Gillespie's garrison was compelled to withdraw in October when the residents, Californio Lancers, vaqueros on horseback without firearms, only lances, revolted and chased the US occupying force back to the San Pedro Harbor. Los Angeles was not retaken until Commodore Stockton again captured the city on January 10, 1847, after the battles at the Siege of Los Angeles, Battle of Dominguez Rancho, Battle of San Pasqual, Battle of Rio San Gabriel and the Battle of La Mesa. These battles, in which the Californios were greatly outmanned and outgunned, represented the important overt resistance to the establishment of the American regime in the Los Angeles Basin. Lieutenant-Colonel Frmont and Governor of Alta California Andrs Pico signed the Treaty of Cahuenga, an informal agreement to cease fighting in California at the Campo de Cahuenga in the San Fernando Valley in January 1847. Under the later comprehensive 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico formally ceded nearly half its nation's total territory, including Alta California, to the United States.\\r\\nLocated on the coastal plains surrounding the Los Angeles River, the town became a cattle ranching center, expanding on the role during the California Gold Rush. It was the center for the Alta California ranchos in the surrounding regions, further developing shipping ability from San Pedro Bay. In the latter 19th century the development of Los Angeles shifted the business district and cultural center of town to the south, present day Downtown Los Angeles, leaving the Pueblo district to decline, and by 1900 it was a less favored area, with the Chinatown district and other ethnic \\"ghettos\\", and the blight of new railroad adjacent industrial areas.\\r\\nA 1920s restoration drive led by Christine Sterling began a restoration of the historic area, starting with Olvera Street. Today the Pueblo's original outline is preserved by the El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic Monument. Among its saved and restored buildings is the oldest standing residence in Los Angeles City, the 1818 Avila Adobe built by Francisco Avila who owned Rancho Las Cienegas -\\"mid Wishire area\\" and a successful cattle enterprise.[15] Across Olvera Street stands the 1887 Eloisa Martinez de Sepulveda House, that now is the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District Visitors Center. The 1939 construction of the significant transit hub and architectural landmark, the Los Angeles Union Station east of the old Plaza, added to the Pueblo area's reinvigoration.\\r\\nOf archaeological interest is the discovery of sections of the original brick lined Zanja Madre-the Mother Ditch, which was a \\"surface and underground\\" gravity fed canal and aqueduct, that brought water from the Rio Porciuncula-Los Angeles River near the Arroyo Seco confluence, to the colonial pueblo and later the American city into the latter 19th century.\\r\\n?This article?incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain:?Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

Although it can be performed with any grip, in recent years some have used the term to refer more specifically to a pull-up performed with a palms-forward position.\\r\\nThe term chin-up, traditionally referring to a pull-up with the chin brought over top of a bar, was used in the 1980s to refer to a palms-away (overhand/pronated) grip, with a palms-toward (underhand/supinated) grip being called a \\"reverse-grip\\" chin-up. [1][2][3][4]\\r\\nIn later decades, this usage has inverted, with some using \\"chin\\" to refer to a pull-up done with a palms-backward position. In spite of this, \\"chin\\" is still regularly used refer to overhand-grip.[5][6][7]\\r\\nThe most popular current meaning refers to a closed-chain body-weight movement where the body is suspended by the arms, gripping something, and pulls up. As this happens, the wrists remain in neutral (straight, neither flexed nor extended) position, the elbows flex and the shoulder adducts and/or extends to bring the elbows to or sometimes behind the torso. The knees may be bent by choice or if the bar is not high enough. Bending the knees or holding your legs out in front slightly may help to reduce swinging.\\r\\nA traditional pull-up relies on upper body strength with no swinging or \\"kipping\\" (using a forceful initial movement of the legs in order to gain momentum). The exercise mostly targets the latissimus dorsi muscle of the back along with other assisting muscles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn past decades, a pull-up also included open-chain pulling exercises done with a barbell.[8] These exercises are now more popularly known as the bent-over row (in the 50s[8]) and upright row (in the 70s[9])\\r\\nThe name refers to pulling up one's body. It can be done with the hands facing any directions, from prone to supine.\\r\\nSome have associated a \\"pull-up\\" with utilizing an overhand (pronated; palms facing away) grip. This includes by the Boy Scouts of America,[10] Guinness World Records[11] \\"makes a difference between\\" pull-ups and chin-ups according to grip. Organizations such as the United States Marine Corps however, see pull-ups including both the overhand and underhand grips.[12]\\r\\nA \\"chin up\\" is bringing the chin up to touch the bar or go over the bar, with a supinated palms-facing grip.\\r\\nVariations of pull ups, beyond being named for their grip, can also be named based on how high the body rises, by naming it after the body part that either comes into contact with or passes over the top of the bar. A \\"chest-up\\" or \\"sternum-up\\" for example, indicates that the chest or sternum meets the bar, requiring extra scapular adduction and depression.\\r\\nPull ups are a common way to measure the upper body strength of the \\"pulling muscles\\". They are used by the United States Marine Corps as a part of the Physical Fitness Test, although marines may also choose to substitute push-ups.[13]\\r\\nPull ups were also used as part of military test in Singapore, where the IPPT for National-Service men is used. It is also used in the NAPFA test for male students above the age of 14. It was then removed in 2014 with the announcement of a new IPPT format.[14]\\r\\nPull-ups (including chins) can be done with a supinated, neutral or pronated grip (often called \\"chin-ups\\", \\"hammer grip pull-ups\\", and \\"pull-ups\\", in order). Grips may match each other or be different (mixed grip). Grips may also rotate throughout the movement, such as by doing them on rings, rotating handles (false grip) or pull up handles. The range of motion used by trainers can vary. The fullest possible range is with straight arms overhead (elbow directly above shoulder), to pulling when the arms are at the sides (elbow directly below shoulder). People sometimes only train portions, such as avoiding locking out the arms at the bottom, or stopping when the head/chin/neck touch the bar. Positions within the range are also trained isometrically, as in flexed-arm and straight-arm hangs for time.\\r\\nThe width of the grip may also differ. When grabbing and holding the bar during the pull-up, the hands can be apart at shoulder-width, or wider, or narrower enough to touch each other. This may make the pull-up more difficult and may limit the range of motion compared to the shoulder-width grip.\\r\\nPull-ups also work the brachialis and brachioradialis in the arms. These muscles are located near the elbow, and help move the forearm. The biceps brachii, or simply biceps, cross the elbow and shoulder joints and work to flex the elbow joint during the exercise. They are involved more with an underhand (supine) grip.[15] The long head of the triceps also crosses the shoulder joint and assists in shoulder adduction.\\r\\nPull-ups use the teres major, a small muscle at the back of the shoulder blade. The nearby rhomboids, which connect the spine to the shoulder blade, play a part too. Pull-ups also use the trapezius[16] along the spine and shoulder, and the levator scapulae[16] along the side of the neck. These muscles work to elevate and depress the shoulder blade, and are sometimes called the \\"shrugging muscles.\\"\\r\\nThe deltoid muscles,[17] specifically the posterior deltoids[18] also assist.\\r\\nMuscles that attach to and depress the scapulae include the lower trapezius muscle and the pectoralis minor. The pec minor also works in conjunction with the rhomboid muscle and levator scapulae to perform downward rotation of the scapulae.\\r\\nMuscles which attach to the scapulae that adduct and extend the arm include the posterior deltoid muscles, the teres major, and minor stabilizing contribution from some rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus and teres minor as lateral rotators, subscapularis as medial rotators).\\r\\nThe abdominal muscles stabilize the torso by connecting the rib cage to the pelvis. The rectus abdominis (along with hip flexors) can generate force to lift the lower body up during kipping, but can also stabilize the front of the pelvis from drifting away from the sternum, just as the erector spinae help to keep the vertebrae from drifting apart in the back. The external and internal obliques perform similar roles on another plane, able to generate or prevent twisting or side-bending, and may help reduce body swinging. The transverse abdominis helps to prevent movement in all directions, encouraging a neutral position.\\r\\nPelvic floor muscles hold the organs up and stabilize the pelvis.[19]\\r\\nThe muscles of the forearm are also worked by holding the overall body weight, improving the strength of the fingers and the forearms muscles creating a strong isometric contraction in these muscle groups.\\r\\nOrganizations like the American Council on Exercise give advice such as \\"care should be taken not to unduly put stress on your shoulder during this exercise.\\"[20] Elbow pain due to tendonitis, bursitis, and ulnar nerve entrapment can occur as a result of excessive pull ups and improper technique.\\r\\nStandard\\r\\nStandard dead-hang pull up is grasped with an overhand/underhand/alternative-hand grip. Then the body is pulled up until the chin clears the bar, and finished by lowering the body until arms and shoulders are fully extended. Stricter standards would only consider a full repetition to be one in which the elbows pass behind the coronal plane.\\r\\nWeighted\\r\\nWeight is added using a dipping belt, or grasping a dumbbell with the feet, or weight vest/shorts\\r\\nBehind-the-neck pull-up\\r\\nThe chin is dropped forward through cervical flexion. The goal of the pull-up is to touch the bar with the back of the neck.\\r\\nMixed grip\\r\\nOne hand is placed in the overhand (pronated) position and the other is placed in the underhand (supinated) position to provide variation on the elbow flexors used.\\r\\nCommando pullup\\r\\nAlso called the cliffhanger pullup, the body is held sideways to the bar, hands right next to each other, one hand pronated and the other supinated, and the body is raised as far as possible (until one shoulder touches the bar). This variation emphasizes one arm, and can be used as a progression towards the one arm pullup.\\r\\nOne arm\\r\\nA one arm pull-up is performed by grasping the bar with only one hand while pulling up. This is difficult due to the considerable strength required.[21]\\r\\nOne hand\\r\\nAn easier version of the one arm pull-up: a pull-up where one hand grips the other arm just below the wrist.\\r\\nClimber's chin-up\\r\\nA pull-up staying as close as possible to one side; typically the arm doing the majority of the work is alternated each repetition. In the most advanced version of this, one arm is kept totally straight; this is called the archer pullup. In an alternative version called the typewriter pullup or around the world pullup, the trainee comes up on one side, moves horizontally across to the other side while holding at the top, and then down on that side.\\r\\nKipping\\r\\nAn easier version in which the body is bent dynamically to help propel the athlete upward. The hips swing first forward and then back as the legs swing forward. Finally, the legs swing downward again, pushing the torso upward. The fastest version where the head follows an elliptical path, moving backward at the bottom of the motion and forward at the top, is sometimes called a butterfly pull-up.[22]\\r\\nSternum chins\\r\\nA pull-up with a longer range of motion, finishing with the bar touching the sternum.\\r\\nMuscle-up\\r\\nA pull-up with a maximal range of motion, transitioning to a dip. Generally the initial pull-up uses an overhand grip to make the switch easier and is more explosive in order to take advantage of momentum from the first half of the exercise to aid in the second half.\\r\\nExtended-leg pull-up\\r\\nAssisted Pull-Up\\r\\nA pull-up band is a large rubber band that is tied around the pull-up bar, then you place either a foot or a knee in the open \\"loop\\" hanging from the bar as you do your pull-ups. The band will assist you by taking on some of the bodyweight load and allowing your muscles to complete the pull up movement at a more manageable weight.\\r\\nSupine row\\r\\nSometimes called an \\"Australian pull-up\\", \\"reverse push-up\\", \\"inclined pull-up\\" or \\"inverted row\\", this is performed with the bar 2 to 3 feet off the floor. The trainee lies on the ground under the bar, face-up, and grasps the bar with extended arms. The exercise is performed by pulling the chest up to the bar. The body is held in a rigid plank position while the heels remain on the floor. \\"Supine\\" refers to the body being face-up, not to the grip: supine rows can be done with prone, neutral or supinated hands.\\r\\nBodyweight:\\r\\nBodyweight (variations):\\r\\nWeighted:\\r\\nAs of January 2015 the most repetitions within a given time period:[38]\\r\\nWorld pull-up organization will organize the first world pull-up championships in the summer of 2019 in Finland. The games will feature two individual disciplines: The pull-up repetitions and the weighted pull-up in several different weight class for both male and female. The competitor may use whatever grip he/she likes (underhand/supinated, overhand/pronated, mixed).[41]","input":"What muscles does close grip pull ups work?"},{"output":"Harrisburg","context":"","input":"Cual es la capital de pensilvania estados unidos?"},{"output":"20 July 1969","context":"??Luna programme (USSR)\\r\\n??Chang'e 3 (China)\\r\\n??Surveyor program (USA)\\r\\n??Apollo program (USA)\\r\\nA Moon landing is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both manned and unmanned (robotic) missions. The first human-made object to reach the surface of the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 mission, on 13 September 1959.[3]\\r\\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first manned mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There have been six manned U.S. landings (between 1969 and 1972) and numerous unmanned landings, with no soft landings happening from 22 August 1976 until 14 December 2013.\\r\\nTo date, the United States is the only country to have successfully conducted manned missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the unsuccessful attempt by the Luna 1 to land on the moon in 1959, the Soviet Union performed the first hard (unpowered) moon landing later that same year with the Luna 2 spacecraft, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. Since then, twelve Soviet and U.S. spacecraft have used braking rockets to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface, between 1966 and 1976. In 1966 the USSR accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five unmanned Surveyor soft landings.\\r\\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first unmanned lunar soil sample return with the Luna 16 probe on 24 September 1970. This was followed by Luna 20 and Luna 24 in 1972 and 1976, respectively. Following the failure at launch in 1969 of the first Lunokhod, Luna E-8 No.201, the Luna 17 and Luna 21 were successful unmanned lunar rover missions in 1970 and 1973.\\r\\nMany missions were failures at launch. In addition, several unmanned landing missions achieved the Lunar surface but were unsuccessful, including: Luna 15, Luna 18, and Luna 23 all crashed on landing; and the U.S. Surveyor 4 lost all radio contact only moments before its landing.\\r\\nMore recently, other nations have crashed spacecraft on the surface of the Moon at speeds of around 8,000 kilometres per hour (5,000?mph), often at precise, planned locations. These have generally been end-of-life lunar orbiters that, because of system degradations, could no longer overcome perturbations from lunar mass concentrations (\\"masscons\\") to maintain their orbit. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006.\\r\\nIndian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The MIP was an ejected probe from the Indian Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface.\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009. The rover mission Chang'e 3 was launched on 1 December 2013 and soft-landed on 14 December.\\r\\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting on 20 July 1969 UTC, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 UTC with Gene Cernan and Jack Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last to step off the lunar surface.\\r\\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the Command Module. The last three missions had a rover for increased mobility.\\r\\nIn order to go to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave the gravity well of the Earth. The only practical way of accomplishing this currently is with a rocket. Unlike other airborne vehicles such as balloons or jets, a rocket is the only known form of propulsion which can continue to increase its speed at high altitudes in the vacuum outside the Earth's atmosphere.\\r\\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99?mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \\"hard landing\\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \\"soft landing\\" (which is the only viable option with human occupants). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[5] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first unmanned soft lunar landing by the U.S.\\r\\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48?mi/s).[6] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the Huygens probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\\r\\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[7] Crash landings[8] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V moon rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the lunar module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\\r\\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing.[citation needed] These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\\r\\nThe intense efforts devoted in the 1960s to achieving first an unmanned and then ultimately a manned moon landing become easier to understand in the political context of its historical era. World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\\r\\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \\"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\\".[9] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[citation needed] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard Sputnik 1 as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[citation needed] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2 and Luna 3 spacecraft.\\r\\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\\r\\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[citation needed] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\\r\\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \\"Luna\\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \\"Sputnik\\" or \\"Cosmos\\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\\r\\nIn contrast to Soviet lunar exploration triumphs in 1959, success eluded initial U.S. efforts to reach the Moon with the Pioneer and Ranger programs. Fifteen consecutive U.S. unmanned lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[10][11] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[12][13]\\r\\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[5][12][14] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600?km/h).[15][16][17]\\r\\nThree different designs of Pioneer lunar probes were flown on three different modified ICBMs. Those flown on the Thor booster modified with an Able upper stage carried an infrared image scanning television system with a resolution of 1 milliradian to study the Moon's surface, an ionization chamber to measure radiation in space, a diaphragm/microphone assembly to detect micrometeorites, a magnetometer, and temperature-variable resistors to monitor spacecraft internal thermal conditions. The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900?mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000?mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\\r\\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Mller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000?mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\\r\\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \\"paddlewheel\\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body that was equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\\r\\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an unmanned spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\\r\\nThe Ranger 1 and 2 Block I missions were virtually identical.[18][19] Spacecraft experiments included a Lyman-alpha telescope, a rubidium-vapor magnetometer, electrostatic analyzers, medium-energy-range particle detectors, two triple coincidence telescopes, a cosmic-ray integrating ionization chamber, cosmic dust detectors, and scintillation counters. The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000?mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000?mi).[18]\\r\\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\\r\\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[5][12][14] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1?m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650?mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5?kN),[12] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5?m in diameter. This lander (code-named Tonto) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42?kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98?ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere[citation needed].\\r\\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer that was designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5?lb (2.3?kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\\r\\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10?ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera which was to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[12] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37?mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took picture (which may be viewed here).\\r\\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080?ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface[citation needed].\\r\\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[citation needed]\\r\\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[citation needed] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo manned Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\\r\\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo manned Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\\r\\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218?lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54?km/h).[20] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[21]\\r\\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[22] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\\r\\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\\"Moonwalker\\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5?km (Lunokhod 1) and 37?km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\\r\\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful unmanned Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\\r\\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with unmanned spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming manned landers with their much greater weight.\\r\\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50 kilometres (31?mi)-per-hour ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160 kilometres (99?mi)-per-hour impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a manned flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\\r\\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before manned spacecraft could follow unmanned ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all utilized flight paths from Earth that traveled directly to the lunar surface without first placing the spacecraft in a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for unmanned spacecraft on a one-way trip.\\r\\nIn contrast, manned vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions which featured lunar orbit operations as a necessary prerequisite to a manned Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial unmanned orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of manned landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\\r\\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\\"mascons\\") can send a manned mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\\r\\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume that would be detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor ÿ currently the only human remains on the Moon.\\r\\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\\r\\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so that it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a manned circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges above and beyond those found in a manned low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a manned Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\\r\\nManned Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 17,000 miles per hour (27,000?km/h; 7,600?m/s). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 25,000 miles per hour (40,000?km/h; 11,000?m/s). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\\r\\nAchieving a manned circumlunar loop flight prior to a manned lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were unmanned planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate manned program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a manned circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\\r\\nInitial manned spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove critical techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking that were crucial to a manned lunar landing mission profile.\\r\\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviets Union began flying their second-generation Zond manned spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet manned Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a manned Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. manned lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\\r\\nLike Zond, Apollo Moon flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop in the event that a Service Module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit as planned. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only manned circumlunar loop mission flown to date.\\r\\nZond 5 was the first spacecraft to carry life from Earth to the vicinity of the Moon and return, initiating the final lap of the Space Race with its payload of turtles, insects, plants and bacteria. Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both of these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to human crewmembers had they been aboard.\\r\\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue unmanned Zond tests until their reliability to support manned flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet manned circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\\r\\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first manned trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a manned Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another unmanned test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\\r\\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first manned trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for manned use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a manned Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4?km) altitude above the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module that was too overweight to allow a successful landing. With the failure of the unmanned Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\\r\\nPlans for manned Moon exploration originated during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in Collier's magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a manned expedition to the Moon to establish a lunar base. A manned Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the United States Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\\r\\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a US project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the United States, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\\r\\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads, and consequently, rockets with smaller payload capacities. By comparison, Soviet nuclear weapons were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest potential missions such as flying around the Moon without landing or establishing a space lab in orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun) were determined to offer too much advantage to the Soviets, since the US would have to develop a heavy rocket to match the Soviets. A Moon landing, however, would capture world imagination while functioning as propaganda.\\r\\nJohnson had championed the US manned space program ever since the Sputnik scare, sponsoring the legislation which created NASA when he was in the Senate in 1958. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best manned space achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating the USSR to a manned lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. This last dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\\r\\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record of zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures, in thirteen launches.\\r\\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians on the left, who wanted more money spent on social programs, and on those on the right, who favored a more military project. By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy planned.\\r\\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 that the USSR was \\"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year would the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\\r\\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Sergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a manned Moon landing.\\r\\nKhrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a manned cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all manned projects under his direction.\\r\\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, the co-ordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for the mission that would have placed Aleksei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a manned landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\\r\\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of manned Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[23]\\r\\nUnlike other international rivalries, the Space Race has remained unaffected in a direct way regarding the desire for territorial expansion. After the successful landings on the Moon, the U.S. explicitly disclaimed the right to ownership of any part of the Moon.\\r\\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in the event that Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[24]\\r\\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that man would reach the Moon by 1978.[25]\\r\\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported that the SSTV tapes were found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[26]\\r\\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[27] Using LROC images, five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[28] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[28]\\r\\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[29]\\r\\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[30]\\r\\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2?km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[31]\\r\\nSELENE or Kaguya was launched on 14 September 2007. After successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[32]\\r\\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, launched 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission.[33]\\r\\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC. The impactor, the Moon Impact Probe, impacted near Shackleton Crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST.[34] Chandrayaan-2 is scheduled for launch in 2018.\\r\\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[35] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[36]\\r\\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (Ebb), and GRAIL B (Flow). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[37][38] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[39] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[40]\\r\\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[41] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[42][43] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[44][45]\\r\\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[46] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was the first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[47]\\r\\nProgress in space exploration has recently broadened the phrase moon landing to include other moons in the Solar System as well. The Huygens probe of the CassiniÿHuygens mission to Saturn performed a successful unmanned moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120?mi (190?km) of performing an unmanned moon landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\\"grunt\\" means \\"soil\\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future moon landing on Jupiter's Europa moon to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.\\r\\nChina is planning to land another rover and collect samples in the Chang'e 4 mission and return lunar soil samples by 2018 in the Chang'e 5 mission.[48]\\r\\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, is planning a second version of Chandrayaan named Chandrayaan 2. According to former ISRO Chairman G. Madhavan Nair, \\"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) hopes to land two rovers ÿ one Indian and another Russian ÿ on the Moon in 2018, as a part of its second Chandrayaan mission. The rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface, pick up samples of soil or rocks, do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the mother-spacecraft Chandrayaan II, which will be orbiting above. Chandrayaan II will transmit the data to Earth.\\" The payloads have already been finalized.[49][50] ISRO has mentioned that due to weight restrictions it will not be carrying any overseas payloads on this mission. The lander weight is projected to be 1,250?kg, and the spacecraft will be launched by the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle.\\r\\nRussia's Luna-Glob 1 is expected to be launched in 2018.[51] In 2007 the head of the Russian Space Agency announced plans to send cosmonauts to the Moon by 2025 and establish a permanent robotically operated base there in 2027ÿ2032.[52] In 2015, Roscosmos stated that Russia plans to place a cosmonaut on the Moon by 2030, leaving Mars to NASA. The purpose is to work jointly with NASA and avoid another Space Race.[53]\\r\\nThe Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a program of robotic spacecraft missions which NASA will use to prepare for future Moon landings.[54] Three orbiters have been launched in the program, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), launched in 2013, but no Moon landings are scheduled yet.\\r\\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition offers a $20?million award for the first privately funded team to land a robotic probe on the Moon. Like the Ansari X Prize before it, the competition aims to advance the state of the art in private space exploration.[55] Of the several competing teams, Puli Space Technologies at one time (2012) planned to launch in 2014[56][needs update] and Astrobotic Technology plans to launch in the second half of 2016 with their own rover plus another team's lunar rovers from Hakuto.[57][58]\\r\\nMany conspiracy theorists hold that the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax;[59] however, empirical evidence is readily available to show that manned moon landings did indeed occur. Anyone on Earth with an appropriate laser and telescope system can bounce laser beams off three retroreflector arrays left on the Moon by Apollo 11,[60] 14 and 15, verifying deployment of the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment at historically documented Apollo Moon landing sites and so proving equipment constructed on Earth was successfully transported to the surface of the Moon. In addition, in August 2009 NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter began to send back high resolution photos of the Apollo landing sites. These photos show not only the large Descent Stages of the lunar landers left behind but also tracks of the astronauts' walking paths in the lunar dust.[61]","input":"When did america first land on the moon?"},{"output":"B.

He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Private First Class Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying them one by one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On 2 May, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and two days later he treated four men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making four separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On 5 May, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small-arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Private First Class Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On 21 May, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited five hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Private First Class Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, this time suffering a compound fracture of one arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Private First Class Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty.\\r\\n\\r\\nOctober 12, 1945\\r\\nTHE WHITE HOUSE[22]\\r\\nOn February 18, 1959, Doss appeared on the Ralph Edwards NBC TV show This Is Your Life.[34]\\r\\nDoss is the subject of The Conscientious Objector, an award-winning documentary by Terry Benedict in 2004.[35]\\r\\nThe feature film Hacksaw Ridge, based on his life, was produced by Terry Benedict and directed by Mel Gibson.

In the context of currency trading, it is often informally called the \\"Kiwi\\",[2] since New Zealand is commonly associated with the indigenous bird and the one-dollar coin depicts a kiwi.\\r\\nIntroduced in 1967, the dollar is subdivided into 100 cents. Altogether there are ten denominationsfive coins and five banknoteswith the smallest being the 10-cent coin. Formerly there were lower denominations, but those were discontinued due to inflation and production costs.\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar is consistently one of the 10 most-traded currencies in the world, being approximately 2.0% of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2013.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of the New Zealand dollar in 1967, the New Zealand pound was the currency of New Zealand, which had been distinct from the pound sterling since 1933. The pound used the Ssd system, in which the pound was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence, which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome.\\r\\nSwitching to decimal currency had been proposed in New Zealand since the 1930s, although only in the 1950s did any plans come to fruition. In 1957, a committee was set up by the Government to investigate decimal currency. The idea fell on fertile ground, and in 1963, the Government decided to decimalise New Zealand currency.[4] The Decimal Currency Act was passed in 1964, setting the date of transition to 10 July 1967.[5] Words such as \\"fern\\", \\"kiwi\\" and \\"zeal\\" were proposed to avoid confusion with the word \\"dollar\\", which many people at the time associated with the United States dollar.[6][7] In the end, the word \\"dollar\\" was chosen anyway, and an anthropomorphic dollar note cartoon character called \\"Mr. Dollar\\" became the symbol of transition in a huge publicity campaign.[8]\\r\\nOn Monday 10 July 1967 (\\"Decimal Currency Day\\"), the New Zealand dollar was introduced to replace the pound at a rate of two dollars to one pound (one dollar to ten shillings, ten cents to one shilling, ?5?6 cent to a penny).[9] Some 27 million new banknotes were printed and 165 million new coins were minted for the changeover.[6]\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar was initially pegged to the US dollar at US$1.43 = NZ$1. This rate changed on 21 November of the same year to US$1.12 = NZ$1 after the devaluation of the British pound (see Bretton Woods system), although New Zealand devalued more than the UK.[10]\\r\\nIn 1971 the US devalued its dollar relative to gold, leading New Zealand on 23 December to peg its dollar at US$1.216 with a 4.5% fluctuation range, keeping the same gold value. From 9 July 1973 to 4 March 1985 the dollar's value was determined from a trade-weighted basket of currencies.\\r\\nThe NZ$ was floated on 4 March 1985 at the initial rate of US$0.4444. Since then the dollar's value has been determined by the financial markets, and has been in the range of about US$0.39 to 0.88.\\r\\nThe dollar's post-float low was US$0.3922 on 22 November 2000, and it reached a post-float high on 9 July 2014 of US$0.8821. Much of this medium-term variation in the exchange rate has been attributed to differences in interest rates.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar's value is often strongly affected by currency trading,[citation needed] and is among the 10 most-traded currencies.[11]\\r\\nOn 11 June 2007 the Reserve Bank sold an unknown worth of New Zealand dollars for nine billion USD in an attempt to drive down its value. This is the first intervention in the markets by the Bank since the float in 1985.\\r\\nTwo suspected interventions followed, but they were not as successful as the first: the first appeared to be initially effective, with the dollar dropping to approximately US$0.7490 from near US$0.7620. However, within little more than a month it had risen to new post-float highs, reaching US$0.8103 on 23 July 2007.\\r\\nAfter reaching its post-float record high in early 2008, the value of the NZ$ plummeted throughout much of the 2nd half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 as a response to the global economic downturn and flight by investors away from \\"riskier\\" currencies such as the NZ$. The NZ$ bottomed out at approximately US$0.50 on 6 March 2009.[12] However, it rebounded strongly as the year progressed, reaching the US$0.75 range by November 2009.[12]\\r\\nBy late 2012, the dollar was holding above 80 US cents, occasionally reaching 85c, prompting calls from the Green Party for quantitative easing.[13][14] Unions also called on the Government and the Reserve Bank to take action, but as of February 2013 both had declined.[15]\\r\\nAs of early June, 2017, the NZD was trading at approximately US$0.71.[16]\\r\\nOn the introduction of the dollar, coins came in denominations of 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c, 20c, and 50c. The 1c and 2c coins were bronze, the others were cupro-nickel.[17] To ease transition, the 5c, 10c and 20c were the same size as the sixpence, shilling and florin that they respectively replaced. Until 1970 the 10c coin bore the additional legend \\"One Shilling\\". The obverse designs of all the coins featured Arnold Machin's portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, with the legend ELIZABETH II NEW ZEALAND [date]. The reverse sides of coins introduced in 1967 did not follow the designs that were originally intended for them. Those modern art and sculpture themed designs were leaked to a newspaper and met a very negative public reaction. The final releases were given more conservative designs in line with public expectations.\\r\\nIn 1986, New Zealand adopted Raphael Maklouf's new portrait of the Queen. The 1c and 2c coins were last minted for circulation in 1987, with collector coins being made for 1988. The coins were demonetised on 30 April 1990.[17] The lack of 1c and 2c coins meant that cash transactions were normally rounded to the nearest 5c (10c from 2006), a process known as Swedish rounding.\\r\\nOn 11 February 1991, aluminium-bronze $1 and $2 coins were introduced to replace existing $1 and $2 notes.[17] In 1999, Ian Rank-Broadley's portrait of the Queen was introduced and the legend rearranged to read NEW ZEALAND ELIZABETH II.\\r\\nOn 11 November 2004 the Reserve Bank announced that it proposed to take the 5c coin out of circulation and to make the 50c, 20c and 10c coins smaller and use plated steel to make them lighter. After a three-month public submission period that ended on 4 February 2005, the Reserve Bank announced on 31 March that it would go ahead with the proposed changes. The changeover period started on 31 July 2006, with the old coins usable until 31 October 2006.[17] The old 50c, 20c, 10c and 5c pieces are now no longer legal tender, but are still redeemable at the Reserve Bank. Prior to the change over these coins were similar, save for the legend and reverse artwork, to international (mainly Commonwealth) coins of the same British-derived sizes, which led to coins from other currencies, particularly older coins, being accepted by vending machines and many retailers.\\r\\nIn 1967, notes were introduced in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $100, with all except the $5 replacing their pound predecessors. The original series of dollar notes featured on the obverse a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II wearing Queen Alexandra's Kokoshnik tiara, King George's VI festoon necklace, and Queen Mary's floret earrings, while the reverse featured native birds and plants.[19] The notes were changed slightly in 1981 due to a change of printer (from De La Rue to Bradbury, Wilkinson & Co.) - the most noticeable difference being the portrait based upon a photograph by Peter Grugeon, in which Queen Elizabeth II is wearing Grand Duchess Vladimir's tiara and Queen Victoria's golden jubilee necklace.[19] The $50 note was added in 1983 to fill the long gap between the $20 and the $100 notes. $1 and $2 notes were discontinued in 1991 after being replaced with coins.\\r\\nA new series of notes was introduced in 1992. The obverse of each note featured a notable New Zealander, while the reverse featured a native New Zealand bird and New Zealand scenery. In 1999, polymer notes replaced the paper notes. The designs remained much the same, but were changed slightly to accommodate new security features, with the most obvious changes being the two transparent windows.\\r\\nNew banknotes are being printed in New Zealand at the moment. The new notes are the same sizes and denominations as the older banknotes, and they will continue to be made of the same flexible plastic material. The themes of the notes remain the same, with the same respected New Zealanders, the Queen, and flora and fauna remaining central to the designs. The $5 and $10 notes were released in October 2015, with the $20, $50 and $100 notes set to release in April 2016. The old New Zealand banknotes and the new 'Brighter Money' banknotes can be used interchangeably for the time being.[20]\\r\\nSince the older banknotes were first issued in 1999, security features and the technology for designing and printing banknotes have all advanced considerably. And while counterfeiting rates in New Zealand are low compared to the rest of the world, the New Zealand public and government agree that it is in the best interest to \\"stay one step ahead of the game\\", hence the new notes.[20]\\r\\nNew Zealand $5 Note (sixth-issue)\\r\\nNew Zealand $10 Note (sixth-issue)\\r\\nNew Zealand $20 Note (sixth-issue)\\r\\nNew Zealand $50 Note (sixth-issue)\\r\\nNew Zealand $100 Note (sixth-issue)\\r\\nNew Zealands five-dollar note has been named the banknote of the year for 2015, a clear winner among nearly 40 eligible designs from a record 20 countries. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand released the new $5 and $10 notes in October as part of its Brighter Money range. The $5 shows mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary facing the South Islands Aoraki/Mount Cook, and, on the other side, a rare yellow-eyed penguin and local flora.\\r\\nWith the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, both Australia and New Zealand converted the mostly-fixed foreign exchange regimes to a moving peg against the US dollar.\\r\\nIn September 1974, Australia moved to a peg against a basket of currencies called the trade weighted index (TWI) in an effort to reduce fluctuations associated with its peg to the US dollar. The peg to the TWI was changed to a moving peg in November 1976, causing the actual value of the peg to be periodically adjusted.\\r\\nSince the late 1990s, and certainly since the end of the Cold War the US dollar has had less and less overall influence over the value of both the NZ$ and A$ against other currencies.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe New Zealand dollar contributes greatly to the total global exchange market - far in excess of New Zealand's relative share of population or global GDP.\\r\\nAccording to the Bank for International Settlements, the New Zealand dollar's share of global foreign exchange market daily turnover in 2016 was 2.1% (up from 1.6% in 2010) giving it a rank of 11th.[3] Trading in the currency has climbed steadily since the same survey in 1998 when the NZD's ranking was 17th and the share of turnover was just 0.2%.","input":"What is the currency in new zealand called?"},{"output":"August 11, 1991","context":"Rugrats is an American animated television series created by Arlene Klasky, Gbor Csup܇ and Paul Germain for Nickelodeon. The show focuses on a group of toddlers, most prominently Tommy, Chuckie, twins Phil and Lil, and Angelica, and their day-to-day lives, usually involving common life experiences that become adventures in the babies' imaginations.[3][4] Adults in the series are almost always unaware of what the children are up to.\\r\\nThe series premiered on Sunday, August 11, 1991, as the second Nicktoon after Doug and preceding The Ren & Stimpy Show. Production was initially halted in 1995 after 65 episodes, with the last episode airing on May 22, 1994. From 1995 to 1996, the only new episodes broadcast were \\"A Rugrats Passover\\" and \\"A Rugrats Chanukah\\", two Jewish-themed episodes that received critical acclaim; during this time, well after the end of the show's production run, Rugrats began to receive a boost in ratings and popularity, due to constant reruns on Nickelodeon. In 1996, Klasky Csupo Animation began producing new episodes, and the show's fourth season began airing in 1997. As a result of the show's popularity, a series of theatrical films were released; The Rugrats Movie, which introduced Tommy's younger brother Dil, was released in 1998, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, which introduced Kimi and Kira, released in 2000, and Rugrats Go Wild, a crossover film with fellow Klasky Csupo series The Wild Thornberrys, released in 2003. The final episode aired on August 1, 2004,[5] bringing the series to a total of 172 episodes and 9 seasons during a 13-year run, tying \\"Rugrats\\" with King of the Hill as the eighth longest-running American animated television series. The series continued to air in reruns on Nickelodeon until December 31, 2007,[6] although the Christmas special \\"Babies in Toyland\\" continued to air every Christmas through 2012. The series returned to Nick from December 27, 2010 until mid 2011, and again for a one off marathon coinciding with the Super Bowl in February 2013.\\r\\nOn July 21, 2001, Nickelodeon broadcast the made-for-TV special \\"All Growed Up\\" in celebration of the series' 10th anniversary. The special acted as a pilot for the Rugrats spin-off series All Grown Up!, which chronicles the lives of the babies and their parents after aging 10 years. Another spin-off series, Rugrats Pre-School Daze, was considered, but only four episodes were produced. Two direct-to-video specials were released in 2005 and 2006, under the title Rugrats Tales from the Crib. Tie-in media for the series include video games, comics, toys and various other merchandise.\\r\\nRugrats gained over 20 awards during its 13-year run, including 4 Daytime Emmy Awards, 6 Kids' Choice Awards, and its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The series garnered high ratings on Nickelodeon and was the network's top-rated show from 1995 to 2000. It was Nickelodeon's longest-running cartoon until 2012, when SpongeBob SquarePants aired its 173rd episode with the episode \\"Squiditis/Demolition Doofus.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRugrats was formed by the then-husband-and-wife duo of Gbor Csup܇ and Arlene Klasky, along with Paul Germain in 1989. Klasky Csupo had a major animation firm at the time which also provided services for commercials and music videos. Klasky, Csup܇, and Germain were also animating The Simpsons at the time, which they would continue to do until 1992. The trio decided to create their own series in reaction to a proclamation by the children's cable network Nickelodeon that they were to launch their own line of animated shows, which would be later called Nicktoons. With the comedic stimulation branching from the antics of Klasky and Csup܇'s infant children and also pulling inspiration from The Beatles, the 6?1?2ÿminute pilot episode, \\"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\\" (never to be aired), went into production.\\r\\nPeter Chung, along with Klasky and Csup܇, co-designed the characters and directed the series pilot, \\"Tommy Pickles and the Great White Thing\\", as well as the opening sequence. In a Decider article, Chung said, \\"He [Gbor] wanted the babies to be 'strange' instead of 'cute.'\\"[7] The production was completed in 1990 and they submitted it to Nickelodeon, who tested it with an audience of children. The feedback for the pilot episode was primarily positive. With that, the series went into production. Chuckie and Angelica were added as characters.\\r\\nPaul Germain felt that the series needed a bully. Angelica was based on a bully in Germain's childhood, who was a girl. In addition to that, it was Germain who decided that Angelica would be a spoiled brat. Klasky initially did not like Angelica Pickles and also protested the character's actions in episodes like \\"Barbecue Story\\", where she throws Tommy's ball over the fence.\\r\\nIn a New Yorker article, Klasky said, \\"I think she's a bully. I never liked Angelica.\\" She never fully approved of Angelica's character development. Her bullying caused Klasky to disdain her. Angelica started to become a problem for some of the Rugrats staff. In some instances, her voice actress, Cheryl Chase, had trouble portraying a mean Angelica. To help Chase out, Steve Viksen, one of the writers, would mention that Angelica was the series' J. R. Ewing.\\r\\nAfter the episode \\"The Trial\\", Klasky complained that the Rugrats were starting to act too old for their age. Csup܇ often acted as a mediator in arguments between Klasky and the writers, with the writers often winning. Some of the offscreen tensions ultimately found their way into the scripts and, naturally, into the show. In 1994, before Nick premiered the last of the original 65, production of new episodes went on hiatus, and most of the Rugrats writing team left Klasky-Csupo. After the first-run days were over, Nickelodeon had enough episodes to show every day, and did just that, scheduling the show in the early evening, when both kids and parents would be watching, among multiple other times in the day; in 1996, Rugrats episodes had aired 655 times over the course of the calendar year, and despite (or perhaps because of) the saturation it remained one of cable television's most watched series that year.[8] The show resumed production in 1997. However, the tensions between Klasky-Csupo and their former writers still existed.\\r\\nAfter The Rugrats Movie and seeing the \\"new\\" Angelica in the film, Klasky changed her tune: \\"I think she's great for the show; I love Angelica.\\"[9]\\r\\nRugrats was Nickelodeon's second Nicktoon, debuting on the same day as Doug (which premiered before it) and The Ren & Stimpy Show (which debuted after). The first run of the series was produced from 1991 to 1994 before production went on a hiatus (episodes that had not yet been released at that point continued to be released through 1995). Between 1995 and 1996, only two Jewish-themed specials were aired, and the rest of the series aired in reruns. Production on new episodes restarted in 1997, and the show aired in Nickelodeon's SNICK block from 1997 to 2000. From 1994 until 2012, Rugrats was Nickelodeon's longest-running Nicktoon, with 172 episodes produced across its thirteen-year run. It was surpassed in 2012 by SpongeBob SquarePants with the episode \\"Squiditis/Demolition Doofus\\" that year.[10]\\r\\nOn July 21, 2001, Rugrats celebrated its 10-year anniversary. The special/TV movie \\"All Growed Up\\" was produced for the occasion. After the show, a special retrospective lookback aired, entitled \\"Rugrats: Still Babies After All These Years\\". It was narrated by Amanda Bynes. Nickelodeon approved of its ratings and popularity so much, they eventually commissioned a full series, All Grown Up, which ran from 2003 to 2008.\\r\\nRugrats ended in 2004, along with fellow Nicktoon Hey Arnold! After the run, two fairytale-themed direct-to-video films based on the original series, under the title Rugrats: Tales from the Crib, were produced and then released separately in 2005 and 2006.\\r\\nThrough its full run, Rugrats occupied several main voice actors. E.G. Daily provided the voice of Tommy Pickles, except in the unaired pilot where Tami Holbrook provided the voice; Christine Cavanaugh was the original voice of Chuckie Finster, but left the show for personal reasons and was subsequently replaced by Nancy Cartwright (voice of Bart Simpson and others on FOX's The Simpsons) in 2002. The fraternal twins, Phil and Lil (as well as their mother, Betty) were voiced by Kath Soucie; Dil Pickles and Timmy McNulty were voiced by Tara Strong. Cheryl Chase initially auditioned for the role of Tommy, but was passed up. When the show came to series, she was brought on board to be cast as the voice of Angelica Pickles. Dionne Quan was the voice of Kimi Finster, however as she is legally blind, in order to do the voice, the producers had to transliterate the scripts into Braille. Susie was primarily voiced by Cree Summer, though in two episodes where she could not be in attendance E.G. Daily filled in.[11] Other regular voice actors included Melanie Chartoff as Didi Pickles, Jack Riley as Stu Pickles, Tress MacNeille as Charlotte Pickles, and Michael Bell as Drew Pickles and Chas Finster. David Doyle provided the voice of Grandpa Lou Pickles until his death in 1997,[12] when Joe Alaskey took over until the end of the series. In 2000, Debbie Reynolds joined the cast as Lulu Pickles, Lou's second wife, and remained until the series' end.\\r\\nWith Rugrats it usually took a few months to make an episode. First the story had to get written, and then approved. The next phase consisted of voice recording, storyboarding, pre-eliminating animation, overseas production and delivery, followed by editing and polishing. All of that had to happen even before Klasky-Csupo sent the master tapes to Nick. In addition, fine animation took time to make. During the first six seasons of Rugrats, shows were primarily divided into two eleven-minute episodes. After the second movie, during season seven, Rugrats made a change with a different format that consisted of three episodes per show, though it returned to its original two-episode-per-show format in the final two seasons.[13]\\r\\nThe series focuses on the experiences of a courageous, adventurous one-year-old baby named Tommy Pickles and his group of playmates?ÿ several other infants and toddlers, some of whom debuted later in the series. Chuckie, Tommy's bespectacled, red-headed, insecure cowardly two-year-old best friend; the twins Phil and Lil, noted for their revolting eccentricities and love of digging for and eating insects and earthworms; Tommy's baby brother Dil (who was born in The Rugrats Movie); Angelica, Tommy and Dil's three-year-old outrageously spoiled, selfish cousin who is a \\"rival\\" of his friends and the main antagonist of the program; Kimi, Chuckie's adventurous, playful stepsister (introduced in Rugrats in Paris); and Susie, a good-hearted neighbor of the Pickles family, Angelica's schoolmate, friend and \\"rival\\", who is better liked by the younger children and far more reliable than Angelica.\\r\\nThe other characters depicted in Rugrats include the babies' parents, who are portrayed as often being easily distracted, leaving their young children free to emancipate themselves from restraints such as playpens or strollers and venture out to explore. Such adult figures include Didi and Stu Pickles, Tommy and Dil's mother and father. Didi is a sweet, educated, loving mother who decides to return to college in one episode. Stu is an often-feckless toy inventor whose designs have been known to either fail or break. Other parents include Chas Finster, Chuckie's stereotypically nerdy, mild-mannered father, a widower who later remarries; Kira, Chuckie's sweet-natured, kind, and understanding stepmother whom Chas marries in Rugrats in Paris; Drew Pickles, Angelica's indulgent, doting father who pampers his daughter to a ridiculous degree; Charlotte Pickles, Angelica's workaholic mother who overindulges her daughter equally, if often seen talking on her cell phone with an employee of hers named Jonathan; Betty DeVille, Phil and Lil's kind but boisterous feminist mother; and Howard DeVille, the twins' mild-mannered, soft-spoken father.\\r\\nSusie's parents and elder siblings also make appearances in some episodes, and another major adult character includes Lou Pickles, Drew and Stu's father and Tommy, Angelica, and Dil's grandfather; an elderly widower who later remarries with an active woman named Lulu. Didi's parents, Jewish immigrants named Boris and Minka, also appear numerous times and serve as important characters and are often seen bickering. Rugrats also has animal characters, including the Pickles family dog, Spike, who has played important roles in some episodes, and Angelica's pet cat Fluffy.\\r\\nThe show functions under a translation convention for baby talk, which is presented as essentially a separate language which only other babies can understand. The babies' dialogue is almost universally translated for viewers into comprehensible English dialogue, but adults in the series cannot understand them. One example of this dissonance is when Tommy says \\"Reptar!\\", (the title character of a popular in-show children's franchise) but his mother then responds that she heard him say \\"riff raff\\", and that she hopes he's getting close to speaking full words, indicating that adult characters still hear the dialogue of baby characters as babbling. The translated dialogue of the babies is still presented as infantile English, reflecting their limited understanding of the world. Another major point of this plot convention is that toddlers who have learned to speak adult language can still understand baby talk, because they are at a transitional age between the two. Angelica and Susie can understand what the baby characters are saying but can also communicate with adults, though they never outright reveal to the adults that they can comprehend complex messages from the babies. Very young newborns, such as Tommy's little brother, cannot yet communicate even with baby talk, although Dil has a very limited vocabulary consisting of the words \\"poopy\\" and \\"mine\\" which are perhaps the only words he is capable of saying. The older babies, such as Tommy and Chuckie, are able to interpret what Dil is trying to communicate although, due to their own age, it is difficult. When the older babies do figure out what Dil wants or needs, it usually involves changing his diaper or giving him an object to play with, or just to experience the joy of holding it.\\r\\nMany of the adventures the babies find themselves in take place at Tommy's house; the parents usually rely on Didi, Stu, or Grandpa Lou to babysit the kids while they run errands. Their address is revealed on an invoice in \\"Tommy's First Birthday\\" (season one, 1991) as 1258 N. Highland, the original address of Klasky Csupo in Los Angeles.[14] However, a specific city or state is never mentioned in the show. Several indicators, such as a state flag at a post office, license plate designs on the vehicles, and various trips to the Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, and the beach, place the characters somewhere in southern California.[15][16][17] The location is also hinted at during \\"Little Dude\\" (season one, 1991) when Didi, who is a teacher, takes Tommy to her class at Eucaipah High School, referencing the city of Yucaipa, California.[18] It has been implied that this ambiguity was done intentionally to help give the impression of seeing the world through the eyes of the babies, who wouldn't understand the concept of location. The DeVilles live next door to the Pickles and, early in the series, the Carmichaels move in across the street.[19][20]\\r\\nRugrats visualizes ordinary, everyday activities through the eyes of a group of toddlers. Using their imaginations, the babies transform routine tasks into surprising adventures. The show plays with baby talk, having the group constantly mispronounce words and use improper grammar. Challenges often emerge because the babies misinterpret the adults, usually caused by Angelica's deceptive translations. The grown-ups of Rugrats are simultaneously quirky, over-cautious, and oblivious. The series portrays adults as mysterious eccentrics. Episodes usually center on a moral lesson that the babies learn during their imaginative explorations.\\r\\nNickelodeon and Amazon.com have struck a deal to produce DVDs of new and old Nickelodeon shows, through the CreateSpace service. Using a concept similar to print on demand, Amazon made the discs, cover art, and disc art itself. The first and second seasons of Rugrats were released on June 2, 2009, along with The Fairly OddParents first and second seasons (although the second Rugrats set contains only the first half of the Season 2 episodes).[21] Season 3 and 4 were released on September 23, 2011, through the CreateSpace program.[22] Season 5 was released shortly after on October 4.[23] On October 6, 2011, the complete Seasons 6ÿ8 were released through CreateSpace, and Season 9 was released in a \\"Best of\\" collection.[24] Amazon re-released seasons 2 & 9 as complete seasons on May 9, 2014.[25] As of February 2017, the Amazon.com releases have been discontinued. In 2017, tvshowsondvd.com reported that Paramount Home Media Distribution will be releasing seasons 1 and 2 in stores in May 2017.[26]\\r\\nIn Australia, all seasons have been released by Beyond Home Entertainment.\\r\\nSince its debut in 1991, Rugrats generally received positive reviews from critics and fans. In a 1995 interview, Steven Spielberg (who, at the time, was producing several competing animated series for Warner Bros.) referred to the show as one of several shows that were the best children's programming at the time. Spielberg described Rugrats as \\"sort of a TV Peanuts of our time\\".[30] It was named the 92nd-best animated series by IGN.[31] Rugrats was also considered a strong point in Nickelodeon's rise in the 1990s.[32][33][34][35] In a press release celebrating the show's 10th anniversary, Cyma Zarghami stated, \\"During the past decade, 'Rugrats' has evolved from a ratings powerhouse, being the number one children's show on TV, to pop icon status. It has secured a place in the hearts of both kids and adults, who see it from their own point of view\\".[36] According to Nickelodeon producers, this show made them the number-one channel in the 1990s.[37] Jeff Jarvis reviewed Rugrats and stated, \\"When The Simpsons was a segment on The Tracey Ullman Show, it was just a belch joke with hip pretensions. As a series, it grew flesh and guts. It was my favorite cartoon... until I discovered Nickelodeon's Rugrats, a sardonic, sly, kid's eye view of the world that skewers thirty-something parents and Cosby kids.\\"[38] In 2017, James Charisma of Paste (magazine) ranked the show's opening sequence #11 on a list of The 75 Best TV Title Sequences of All Time.[39]\\r\\nRugrats, which at the time had moderately high ratings, was scheduled to air 65 episodes as Nickelodeon felt that it had enough reruns for a few years, putting production on a hiatus in 1994. Production of Rugrats resumed in 1996 with three specials, and followed with new episodes airing by 1997.[40]\\r\\nWhen Rugrats debuted in 1991, it was not as popular as it would later become. When production went on a hiatus in 1994, Nick began showing Rugrats repeats every day. More people began to take notice of the show, with ratings and popularity for Rugrats and Nick rising. From 1995 to 2000, it was the highest-rated show on Nickelodeon and the highest rated kids' show. The show experienced a wide diverse audience consisting of kids, teenagers and adults alike. Rugrats was successful in receiving an average of 26.7 million viewers every week: 14.7 million kids, 3.2 million teens, and 8.8 million adults. In addition, Rugrats was seen internationally in over 76 countries.[36] It was the only one of the three original Nicktoons that continued in the 2000s and had its own spin-off. While the other Nicktoons were popular during their run, Doug would later slip out of Nick's hands and into Disney's; and Ren and Stimpy would crash and burn in a creative rights dispute (only to return several years later in a much raunchier version on another network). During its run, Rugrats was enjoyed by a number of famous stars including Alexa Vega, Daryl Sabara, Amanda Bynes, Aaron Carter, Ray Romano, Nivea and Bow Wow.[41]\\r\\nRugrats was noteworthy among contemporary children's television for depicting observant, identifiable Jewish families.[42] Jewish and Christian religion groups gave the show high praises for their special holiday episodes. Nonetheless, at one point the Anti-Defamation League and The Washington Post editorial page castigated the series for its depiction of Tommy Pickles' maternal grandparents, accusing their character designs of resembling Nazi-era depictions of Jews.[42]\\r\\nOn June 28, 2001, in commemoration of their tenth anniversary, Rugrats received a star on the fabled Hollywood Walk of Fame, making it Nickelodeon's first (and to date, only) series to receive a star. It was placed at 6600 W. Hollywood Blvd., near Cherokee Ave., outside a toy and costume shop.[46]\\r\\nIn the October 2001 issue of Wizard Magazine, a leading magazine for comic book fans, they released the results of the \\"100 Greatest Toons ever\\", as selected by their readers; Rugrats ranked at No. 35. Three other NicktoonsSpongeBob SquarePants, Invader Zim, and Ren and Stimpyalso placed on the list.[47]\\r\\nIn a list of TV Land's \\"The 2000 Best Things About Television\\", ranking the all-time TV shows, channels, commercials, people, catch phrases, etc., Rugrats is ranked #699.[48]\\r\\nAngelica Pickles placed seventh in TV Guide's list of \\"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time\\" in 2002.[49]\\r\\nOn September 24, 2013, in honor of TV Guide's 60th anniversary, Rugrats earned a spot on their \\"60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time\\" list.[50]\\r\\nIn 1998, The Rugrats Movie was released, which introduced baby Dil, Tommy's little brother, onto the show. It grossed in worldwide results, $140,894,675, making it a very large box office success, considering its modest $24 million budget, though it also received mixed reviews from critics. In 2000 a sequel, Rugrats in Paris: The Movie, was released, with three new characters introduced, Kimi, Kira, and Fifi. Kimi would become Chuckie's sister and Kira would become his new mother, after marrying his father. Fifi would become Spike's new mate and Chuckie's new dog. It too was a box office success and also received a more positive critical reception. In 2003, Rugrats Go Wild was released. It was a crossover between the Rugrats and The Wild Thornberrys.[51] It was the least successful Rugrats film both critically and commercially. The Rugrats will appear in an upcoming Nicktoons film.[52] The rugrats film trilogy has grossed $299.6 million making it the 25th highest-grossing animated film series of all time.\\r\\nFrom 1998 to 2003, Nick produced a Rugrats comic strip, which was distributed through Creators Syndicate. Initially written by show-writer Scott Gray and drawn by comic book artist Steve Crespo, with Rob Armstrong as editor. Will Blyberg came on board shortly after as inker. By the end of '98, Lee Nordling, who had joined as a contributing gag writer, took over as editor. Nordling hired extra writers, including Gordon Kent, Scott Roberts, Chuck Kim, J. Torres, Marc Bilgrey, and John Zakour, as well new artists including Gary Fields, Tim Harkins, Vince Giaranno, and Scott Roberts. Stu Chaifetz colored the Sunday strips. The Rugrats strip started out in many papers, but as often happens with spin-off strips, soon slowed down. It is still seen in some papers in re-runs. Two paperback collections were published by Andrews McMeel It's a Jungle-Gym Out There and A Baby's Work Is Never Done.\\r\\nDuring this time, Nickelodeon also published 30 issues of an all Rugrats comic magazine. Most of these were edited by Frank Pittarese and Dave Roman, and featured stories and art by the comic strip creators and others. The last nine issues featured cover art by Scott Roberts, who wrote and drew many of the stories. Other writers included Roman, Chris Duffy, Patrick M. O'Connell, Joyce Mann, and Jim Spivey. Other artists included Joe Staton and Ernie Col܇n. The magazine also included short stories, many by Pittarese, and games, as well as reprints from an earlier, UK produced Rugrats comic.\\r\\nFinally, Nick produced a special, 50-page comic magazine retelling of the film Rugrats in Paris, edited by Pittarese and Roman, with script by Scott Gray, pencils by Scott Roberts, and inks by Adam DeKraker.\\r\\nNineteen video games based on the series have been released: Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt for Nintendo 64; Rugrats: Search for Reptar and Rugrats: Studio Tour for PlayStation, Rugrats: Totally Angelica for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color; Rugrats: Time Travelers and The Rugrats Movie for Game Boy Color; Rugrats in Paris: The Movie for Nintendo 64, PlayStation, Game Boy Color, and PC CD Rom; Rugrats: Royal Ransom for PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube; Rugrats: Totally Angelica Boredom Busters, All Growed Up, Rugrats Activity Challenge, Rugrats Adventure Game, Rugrats Munchin Land, and The Rugrats Mystery Adventures for PC CD Rom; Rugrats Go Wild for PC CD Rom and Game Boy Advance; Rugrats: I Gotta Go Party, Rugrats: Castle Capers, and All Grown Up!: Express Yourself for Game Boy Advance; and Rugrats Food Fight for Mobile phone. Tommy and Angelica appear as guest characters in Rocket Power: Team Rocket Rescue. They appear again as playable characters in Nickelodeon Party Blast and Nicktoons Racing. Tommy later appears in Nicktoons Basketball in his All Grown Up! form. Rugrats characters make non-playable appearances in Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots and Nicktoons MLB.\\r\\nRugrats?ÿ A Live Adventure was a show about Angelica's constant attempts to scare Chuckie. To help Chuckie combat his wide range of fears, Tommy invents a magic wand called the \\"People-ator\\" to make Chuckie brave. Angelica, however, wants Chuckie to stay scared, so she steals Tommy's wand. The Rugrats try to get it back, but to no avail. Angelica becomes Princess of the World. Eventually, Chuckie becomes brave thanks to the help of Susie, Mr. Flashlight and the audience.[53] Many songs were included in the play, including the theme song. Despite some criticism, the show was well received.[54] The show had two 40-minute acts, with a 20-minute intermission (or a commercial break).\\r\\nMerchandise that was based on Rugrats varied from video games, toothpaste, Kelloggs' cereal to slippers, puzzles, pajamas, jewelry, wrapping paper, Fruit Snacks, Inflatable balls, watches, pens, pencils, markers, cookie jars, key rings, action figures, My First Uno games, and bubblegum. The show also managed to spawn a popular merchandise line at Walmart, Kmart, Target, EBay, Hot Topic, J. C. Penney, Toys \\"R\\" Us, Mattel, Barnes & Noble, and Basic Fun.[55]\\r\\nThe Rugrats had their own cereal made by Post called Reptar Crunch Cereal. The Rugrats and Reptar were predominantly featured on the front, there's a board game on the back, and a special $3 rebate for Runaway Reptar on the side. This cereal was released for a limited time only, sold at US supermarkets 8/1/99 to 9/15/99 only, and not all supermarkets carried the cereal. To memorialize the movie, Rugrats in Paris, another Rugrats-based cereal came out in October 2000. Simply called the Rugrats in Paris Cereal, it has a similar appearance to Trix; it's a sweetened, multi-grain cereal with small-round bits in plain, red, purple and green. Small Eiffel Towers could also be seen.[56] In 2017, entertainment retail store chain FYE began selling Reptar Cereal, as well as Reptar Bars, both based on fictional products within the show. Reptar Cereal is very similar to Froot Loops, and Reptar Bars are chocolate bars filled with green frosting, a reference to the show in which the bars would turn the tongues of whoever ate it green.\\r\\nRugrats made fast-food appearances as well, with the most appearances being on Burger King. In 1994, the Hardee's fast food chain offered a collection of Nicktoons toys as premiums that were included with kids' meals at their restaurants. All 4 Nicktoons at that time were featured  Doug, Rugrats, Ren & Stimpy, and Rocko's Modern Life. Other food items that feature Rugrats were Fruit Snacks, Macaroni and Cheese, Bubble Gum and Campbell's Rugrats Pasta with Chicken and Broth.[57]\\r\\nIn their first tie-in with Burger King, 5 Rugrats toys were offered with their Kids Club meals, a different one with each meal. Each toy came with a 12-page (including covers) miniature version of Nickelodeon Magazine, which featured the toy's instructions, word search, picture puzzle, \\"Say What?\\", a scrambled word puzzle, a coupon for Oral-B Rugrats toothpaste and toothbrush, and entry blanks to subscribe to Rugrats Comic Adventures, Nick Magazine and the Kids Club. From 1998 till 2004, Rugrats based-products included watches and various toys.[58]\\r\\nIn 2012, co-creator Arlene Klasky stated that, if Nickelodeon asked Klasky Csupo to, she would be more than happy to produce new episodes of Rugrats and bring it back for a tenth season.[citation needed].\\r\\nOn September 2, 2015, it was announced that Nickelodeon may \\"seek to experiment with retooled versions of classics\\" that could include Rugrats.[59]\\r\\nOn September 3, 2015, The Independent announced that \\"Rugrats could soon be back on our screens too\\".[60]\\r\\nIn July 2016, it was revealed that Nickelodeon was in talks with Klasky Csupo and Paul Germain about a possible revival of the series.[61][62][63]\\r\\nOn August 4, 2016, Arlene Klasky stated that she would be willing to work on a revival of the series, along with co-creators Gabor Csupo and Paul Germain.[64]\\r\\nOn August 8, 2016, two of Rugrats' three creators stated that they agreed there was definitely a way to bring the baby adventures of Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, and Angelica back ÿ although they differ on how. Co-creator Paul Germain says it's a possibility, if Nickelodeon is so inclined. \\"It's completely up to them, but I think it could be interesting,\\" he told EW. The hitch here is Germain, who was largely the creative voice of Rugrats once it went to series, left after the original order of 65 episodes. \\"A lot of the direction that they took the show in after I left in 1993 ÿ the second 65 episodes and then the All Grown Up series ÿ I thought those episodes were poor. I thought they lost the spirit of it. I think the way to go [for a reboot] would be to take it back to where it was. I don't know if we could really do that, but that's what I would like to see. I think it's possible.\\" Arlene Klasky, who co-created the show with Gabor Csupo and Germain but left showrunning to the latter, said a revival is something she and Csupo \\"think about, 100 percent.\\" But Klasky and Germain would disagree on one of the first fundamental questions that would face Rugrats, just as it faces every reboot: whether the show should acknowledge the passing of time and, in the case of this show, how technology has seeped its way into child-rearing. Germain says he'd rather keep a Rugrats reboot as a time capsule. \\"One of the things I think might be fun would be to just make the show a retro '90s show,\\" he says. \\"I think that'd be cool. Cell phones can be interesting, but technology has a funny way of making it very difficult to write around because people are always in constant communication with each other in a way that works against drama. It takes a really fun writers' obstacle away and makes it too easy.\\"[65]\\r\\nIn October 2016, a Nickelodeon senior vice president stated that Rugrats was one of many fan-favorite franchises being considered for a revival. \\"Nickelodeon is going to look at the rich library they have, and not just Rugrats,\\" Michael Sammaciccia said, in response to a fan question.[66]","input":"When did the first episode of rugrats air?"},{"output":"in and around Melbourne","context":"Mad Max is a 1979 Australian dystopian action film directed by George Miller, produced by Byron Kennedy, and starring Mel Gibson as \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky, Joanne Samuel, Hugh Keays-Byrne, Steve Bisley, Tim Burns, and Roger Ward. James McCausland and Miller wrote the screenplay from a story by Miller and Kennedy. The film presents a tale of societal collapse, murder, and revenge set in a future Australia, in which an unhinged policeman becomes embroiled in a violent feud with a savage motorcycle gang. Principal photography took place in and around Melbourne, Australia, and lasted six weeks.\\r\\nThe film initially received a polarized reception upon its release in April 1979, although it won three AACTA Awards and attracted a cult following, while its critical reputation has grown since. The film earned more than US$100 million worldwide in gross revenue. It held the Guinness record for most profitable film and has been credited for further opening up the global market to Australian New Wave films. The film became the first in the Mad Max series, giving rise to three sequels, Mad Max 2 (1981), Beyond Thunderdome (1985), and Fury Road (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"A few years from now\\", when society is teetering upon the brink of collapse, berserk motorbike gang member Crawford \\"Nightrider\\" Montazano (Vincent Gil) steals a Pursuit Special, which he uses to escape from police custody after killing a rookie officer of an Australian highway patrol called the Main Force Patrol (MFP). Even though he manages to elude other MFP officers, the MFP's top pursuit man Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) then engages the less-skilled Nightrider in a high-speed chase. Crawford breaks off first, but then is unable to recover his concentration before he and his girlfriend are killed in a fiery crash.\\r\\nAt the MFP garage, Max is shown what one of the MFP mechanics has been working on: a supercharged black Pursuit Special, the last of the V8 Interceptors.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Nightrider's motorbike gang, led by Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and Bubba Zanetti (Geoff Parry), run roughshod over a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel, and terrorising the population. They trap a young couple in a car, destroy the car, and it is implied that they rape the couple. Max and fellow officer Jim Goose (Steve Bisley) arrest Toecutter's young protg Johnny the Boy (Tim Burns) at the scene. When neither the rape victims nor any of the townspeople show for Johnny's trial, the federal courts close the case, Johnny's attorneys releasing him into Bubba's custody over Goose's furious objections.\\r\\nWhile Goose visits a nightclub in the city the next day, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike in the parking lot. After being thrown into a field at high speed uninjured during a ride, Goose borrows a ute to haul his damaged bike back to the MFP. However, Johnny ambushes Goose off the road by throwing a brake drum through his windshield, and, at Toecutter's insistence, throws a match into the wreck of the ute, igniting the gasoline and burning Goose alive. After seeing Goose's charred body in a hospital intensive-care unit, Max becomes disillusioned with the MFP, and informs his superior Fifi Macaffee (Roger Ward) that he will resign. Fifi convinces Max to take a vacation first before he submits his final letter of resignation.\\r\\nMax takes his wife Jessie (Joanne Samuel) and their infant son Sprog (Brendan Heath) on vacation in a panel van. When they stop to fix the spare tyre, Jessie takes Sprog to buy ice cream. They encounter Toecutter and his gang, who attempt to molest Jessie, but Jessie kicks Toecutter in the crotch, picks up Sprog and escapes with him in the car. They flee to a remote farm owned by an elderly friend named May Swaisey (Sheila Florance). Toecutter's gang follows them there and ambushes Jessie in the woods. With May's help, Jessie and Sprog escape, but when they try to drive away, the van overheats and they are run over by the gang while trying to escape on foot. Sprog is killed and Jessie is badly injured. Max arrives too late to do anything.\\r\\nJessie is near death in a hospital ICU, and the loss of his family ultimately drives Max insane. He dons his police uniform and takes the black Pursuit Special from the MFP garage to pursue and eliminate the gang. He rams several gang members off a bridge at high speed, kills Bubba during an ambush, and forces Toecutter into the path of a speeding semi-trailer truck. Finally, Max locates Johnny at a car wreck stealing the boots of its dead driver. Max handcuffs Johnny's ankle to the wrecked vehicle, and sets a crude time-delay fuse involving a slow petrol leak and Johnny's lighter. Max throws Johnny a hacksaw, leaving him the choice of sawing through either the handcuffs or his ankle in order to escape within the given time limit. As Max drives away from the bridge, the vehicle explodes. Now a shell of his former self, Max drives on to points unknown.\\r\\nGeorge Miller was a medical doctor in Sydney, working in a hospital emergency room where he saw many injuries and deaths of the types depicted in the film. He also witnessed many car accidents growing up in rural Queensland and lost at least three friends to accidents as a teenager.[3]\\r\\nWhile in residency at a Sydney hospital, Miller met amateur filmmaker Byron Kennedy at a summer film school in 1971. The duo produced a short film, Violence in the Cinema, Part 1, which was screened at a number of film festivals and won several awards. Eight years later, the duo produced Mad Max, working with first-time screenwriter James McCausland (who appears in the film as the bearded man in an apron in front of the diner).\\r\\nAccording to Miller, his interest while writing Mad Max was \\"a silent movie with sound\\", employing highly kinetic images reminiscent of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd while the narrative itself was basic and simple. Miller believed that audiences would find his violent story more believable if set in a bleak dystopian future.[4] Screenwriter McCausland drew heavily from his observations of the 1973 oil crisis' effects on Australian motorists:\\r\\nYet there were further signs of the desperate measures individuals would take to ensure mobility. A couple of oil strikes that hit many pumps revealed the ferocity with which Australians would defend their right to fill a tank. Long queues formed at the stations with petroland anyone who tried to sneak ahead in the queue met raw violence. ... George and I wrote the [Mad Max] script based on the thesis that people would do almost anything to keep vehicles moving and the assumption that nations would not consider the huge costs of providing infrastructure for alternative energy until it was too late.\\r\\nKennedy and Miller first took the film to Graham Burke of Roadshow, who was enthusiastic. The producers felt they would be unable to raise money from the government bodies \\"because Australian producers were making art films, and the corporations and commissions seemed to endorse them whole-heartedly\\", according to Kennedy.[6]\\r\\nThey designed a 40-page presentation, circulated it widely, and eventually raised the money. Kennedy and Miller also contributed funds themselves by doing three months of emergency medical calls, with Kennedy driving the car while Miller did the doctoring.[6] Miller claimed the final budget was between $350,000 and $400,000.[7] His brother Bill Miller was an associate producer on the film.[8]\\r\\nGeorge Miller had considered an American actor to \\"get the film seen as widely as possible\\" and even travelled to Los Angeles, but eventually opted to not do so as \\"the whole budget would be taken up by a so-called American name.\\"[4] So instead the cast would deliberately feature lesser known actors so they did not carry past associations with them.[3] Miller's first choice for the role of Max was the Irish-born James Healey, who at the time worked at a Melbourne abattoir and was seeking a new acting job. Upon reading the script Healey declined, finding the meager, terse dialogue too unappealing.[9]\\r\\nCasting director Mitch Mathews invited for Mad Max a class of recent National Institute of Dramatic Art graduates, specifically asking a NIDA teacher for \\"spunky young guys\\". Among these actors was Mel Gibson, whose audition impressed Miller and Matthews and earned him the role of Max. An apocryphal tale stated that Gibson went to auditions in poor shape following a fight, but this has been denied by both Matthews and Miller. Gibson's friend and classmate Steve Bisley, who worked with him in his only screen role, 1976's Summer City, became Max's partner Jim Goose. A classmate of both, Judy Davis, was said to have auditioned and passed over,[9] but Miller has declared she was only in Matthews' studio to accompany Gibson and Bisley.[4]\\r\\nMost of the biker gang extras were members of actual Australian outlaw motorcycle clubs and rode their own motorcycles in the film. They were even forced to ride the motorcycles from their residence in Sydney to the shooting locations in Melbourne because the budget did not allow for aerial transport.[4] Three of the main cast members (Hugh Keays-Byrne, Roger Ward and Vincent Gil) had previously appeared in Stone, a 1974 film about biker gangs that is said to have inspired Miller.[10]\\r\\nMax's yellow Interceptor was a 1974 Ford Falcon XB sedan (previously a Victoria police car) with a 351 c.i.d. Cleveland V8 engine.[11]\\r\\nThe Big Bopper, driven by Roop and Charlie, was also a 1974 Ford Falcon XB sedan and a former Victoria police car, but was powered by a 302 c.i.d. V8.[12] The March Hare, driven by Sarse and Scuttle, was an in-line-six-powered 1972 Ford Falcon XA sedan (this car was formerly a Melbourne taxi cab).[13]\\r\\nThe most memorable car, Max's black Pursuit Special was a 1973 Ford XB Falcon GT351, a limited edition hardtop (sold in Australia from December 1973 to August 1976), which was primarily modified by Murray Smith, Peter Arcadipane, and Ray Beckerley. The main modifications are the Concorde front end and the supercharger protruding through the bonnet (for looks only; it was not functional). The Concorde front was a fairly new accessory at the time, designed by Peter Arcadipane at Ford Australia as a showpiece, and later became available to the general public because of its popularity.[14] After filming of the first movie was completed, the car went up for sale, but no buyers were found; eventually it was given to Smith.\\r\\nWhen production of Mad Max 2 began, Miller brought the car back for use in the sequel. Once filming was over the car was left at a wrecking yard in Adelaide since it again found no buyers, and was bought and restored by Bob Forsenko. Eventually it was sold again and was put on display in the Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in Cumbria, England. When the museum closed, the car went to a collection in the Dezer Museum in Miami, Florida.[15]\\r\\nThe Nightrider's vehicle, another Pursuit Special, was a 1972 Holden HQ Monaro LS coupe, also tuned but deliberately damaged to look like it had been involved in crashes.[16]\\r\\nThe car driven by the young couple that is vandalised and then finally destroyed by the bikers is a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air Sedan, also modified to look like a hot-rod car with fake fuel injection stacks, fat tires, and a flame red paint job.\\r\\nOf the motorcycles that appear in the film, 14 were Kawasaki Kz1000 donated by a local Kawasaki dealer. All were modified in appearance by Melbourne business La Parisienne  one as the MFP bike ridden by 'The Goose' and the balance for members of the Toecutter's gang, played in the film by members of a local Victorian motorcycle club, the Vigilantes.[17]\\r\\nBy the end of filming, fourteen vehicles had been destroyed in the chase and crash scenes, including the director's personal Mazda Bongo (the small, blue van that spins uncontrollably after being struck by the Big Bopper in the film's opening chase).[18]\\r\\nOriginally, filming was scheduled to take ten weekssix weeks of first unit, and four weeks on stunt and chase sequences. However, four days into shooting, Rosie Bailey, who was originally cast as Max's wife, was injured in a bike accident. Production was halted, and Bailey was replaced by Joanne Samuel, causing a two-week delay.\\r\\nIn the end, the shoot took six weeks over November and December 1977, with a further six-week second unit. The unit reconvened two months later, in May 1978, and spent another two weeks doing second unit shots and re-staging some stunts.[6] Miller described the whole experience as \\"guerrilla filmmaking\\", where the crew would close roads without filming permits, not use walkie-talkies because their frequency coincided with the police radio, and after filming was done Miller and Kennedy would even sweep down the roads. Still, as filming progressed the Victoria Police became interested in the production, helping the crew by closing down roads and escorting the vehicles.[4] Because of the film's low budget, all but one of the police uniforms in the film were made of vinyl leather, with only one genuine leather uniform made for stunt sequences involving Bisley and Gibson.\\r\\nShooting took place in and around Melbourne. Many of the car chase scenes for Mad Max were filmed near the town of Little River, northeast of Geelong. The early town scenes with the Toe Cutter Gang were filmed in the main street of Clunes, north of Ballarat. Much of the streetscape remains unchanged. Some scenes were filmed at Tin City at Stockton Beach.[19][20] The \\"execution of the mannequin\\" scene was filmed at Seaford Beach in Seaford, Victoria.\\r\\nMad Max was one of the first Australian films to be shot with a widescreen anamorphic lens,[7] although Peter Weir's The Cars That Ate Paris (1974) was shot in anamorphic four years earlier.[21] Miller's desire to shoot in anamorphic made him seek a set of Todd-AO wide angle lenses used by Sam Peckinpah to film The Getaway (1972), which were damaged enough in that shoot to get discarded in Australia. The only one which worked properly was a 35mm lens which was employed in the whole of Mad Max.[4]\\r\\nThe film's post-production was done at a friend's apartment in North Melbourne, with Wilson and Kennedy editing the film in the small lounge room on a home-built editing machine that Kennedy's father, an engineer, had designed for them. Wilson and Kennedy also performed sound editing there.\\r\\nTony Patterson edited the film for four months, then had to leave because he was contracted to make Dimboola (1979). George Miller took over editing with Cliff Hayes, and they worked on it for three months. Kennedy and Miller did the final cut,[6] in a process Miller described as \\"he would cut sound in the lounge room and Id cut picture in the kitchen.\\" Professional sound engineer Roger Savage would perform the sound mixing in the studio he worked after finishing his work with Little River Band, and employed timecoding techniques that were unseen in Australian cinema.[4]\\r\\nThe musical score for Mad Max was composed and conducted by Australian composer Brian May (not to be confused with the guitarist of the English rock band Queen). Miller wanted a Gothic, Bernard Herrmannÿtype score and hired May after hearing his work for Patrick (1978).[3] \\"With the little budget that we had we went ahead and did it, and spent a lot of time on it,\\" said May. \\"George was marvelous to work with; he had a lot of ideas about what he wanted although he wasnt a musician.\\"[22] A soundtrack album was released in 1980 by Varse Sarabande.[23]\\r\\nMad Max was first released in Australia through Roadshow Film Distributors (now Village Roadshow Pictures) in 1979.[24] The movie was sold overseas for $1.8 million, with American International Pictures releasing in the United States and Warner Bros. handling the rest of the world.[7] The film was banned in New Zealand and Sweden, in the former because of the scene where Goose is burned alive inside his vehicle: it unintentionally mirrored an incident with a real gang shortly before the film's release. It was later shown in New Zealand in 1983 after the success of the sequel, with an 18 certificate.[25] The ban in Sweden was removed in 2005, and it has since been shown on television and sold on home media there.[26]\\r\\nWhen shown in the United States during 1980, the original Australian dialogue was redubbed by an American crew.[27] American International Pictures distributed this dub after it underwent a management re-organisation.[28] Much of the Australian slang and terminology was also replaced with American usages (examples: \\"Oi!\\" became \\"Hey!\\", \\"See looks!\\" became \\"See what I see?\\", \\"windscreen\\" became \\"windshield\\", \\"very toey\\" became \\"super hot\\", and \\"proby\\"probationary officerbecame \\"rookie\\"). AIP also altered the operator's duty call on Jim Goose's bike in the beginning of the film (it ended with \\"Come on, Goose, where are you?\\"). The only dubbing exceptions were the voice of the singer in the Sugartown Cabaret (played by Robina Chaffey), the voice of Charlie (played by John Ley) through the mechanical voice box, and Officer Jim Goose (Steve Bisley), singing as he drives a truck before being ambushed. Since Mel Gibson was not well known to American audiences at the time, trailers and television spots in the United States emphasised the film's action content. The original Australian dialogue track was finally released in North America in 2000 in a limited theatrical reissue by MGM, the film's current rights holders. It has since been released in the US on DVD with the US and Australian soundtracks on separate tracks.[29][30]\\r\\nUpon its release, the film polarized critics. In a 1979 review, the Australian social commentator and film producer Phillip Adams condemned Mad Max, saying that it had \\"all the emotional uplift of Mein Kampf\\" and would be \\"a special favourite of rapists, sadists, child murderers and incipient [Charles] Mansons\\".[31] After its United States release, Tom Buckley of The New York Times called the film \\"ugly and incoherent\\".[32] Stephen King, writing in Danse Macabre, called the film a \\"turkey.\\" However, Variety magazine praised the directorial debut by Miller.[33]\\r\\nMad Max grossed A$5,355,490 at the box office in Australia and over US$100 million worldwide.[34][2] It was the most profitable film ever made at the time, holding the Guinness World Record for the highest box office to budget ratio of any motion picture.[35] The film was awarded three Australian Film Institute Awards in 1979 (for editing, sound, and musical score). It was also nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Keays-Byrne) by the Australian Film Institute. The film also won the Special Jury Award at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.[36]\\r\\nMad Max holds a 90% \\"Fresh\\" rating on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 54 positive critic reviews, with consensus being \\"Staging the improbable car stunts and crashes to perfection, director George Miller succeeds completely in bringing the violent, post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max to visceral life.\\"[37] The film has been included in \\"best films of all time\\" lists by The New York Times[38] and The Guardian.[39]","input":"Where was the first mad max movie filmed?"},{"output":"Congress of the Confederation","context":"The Articles of Confederation, formally the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, was an agreement among the 13 original states of the United States of America that served as its first constitution.[1] It was approved, after much debate (between July 1776 and November 1777), by the Second Continental Congress on November 15, 1777, and sent to the states for ratification. The Articles of Confederation came into force on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states. The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.[2]\\r\\nThe Articles formed a war-time confederation of states, with an extremely limited central government. While unratified, the document was used by the Congress to conduct business, direct the American Revolutionary War, conduct diplomacy with foreign nations, and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government, because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress, since its organization remained the same.[2]\\r\\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after Shays' Rebellion, individuals began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the Constitutional Convention. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.[3] On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the federal government under the Constitution.[4] The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the President), courts, and taxing powers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the Albany Congress in 1754 and Benjamin Franklin's proposed Albany Plan, an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown. With civil disobedience resulting in coercive, and what the colonials perceived as intolerable acts of Parliament, and armed conflict resulting in dissidents being proclaimed rebels and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the Second Continental Congress began acting as the provisional government that would run the American Revolutionary War and gain the colonies their collective independence.\\r\\nIt was an era of constitution writingmost states were busy at the taskand leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued fiat money, created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.[5]\\r\\nTo transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation, the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, Thomas Paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of Common Sense that the \\"custom of nations\\" demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \\"manifesto\\" which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \\"[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\\"[6]\\r\\nBeyond improving their existing association, the records of the Second Continental Congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \\"to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\\" and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \\"a firm league\\" among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.[7]\\r\\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the Declaration of Independence, the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states. The committee met repeatedly, and chairman John Dickinson presented their results to the Congress on July 12, 1776. There were long debates on such issues as sovereignty, the exact powers to be given the confederate government, whether to have a judiciary, and voting procedures.[8] The final draft of the Articles was prepared in the summer of 1777 and the Second Continental Congress approved them for ratification by the individual states on November 15, 1777, after a year of debate.[9] Consensus was achieved by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a unicameral legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states.\\r\\nThe Articles of Confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in November 1777. The first state to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process.[10] The lone holdout, Maryland, refused to go along until the landed states, especially Virginia, had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the Ohio River to the Union.[11] It would be two years before the Maryland General Assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through, and voted to ratify. During this time, Congress observed the Articles as its de facto frame of government. Maryland finally ratified the Articles on February 2, 1781. Congress was informed of Maryland's assent on March 1, and officially proclaimed the Articles of Confederation to be the law of the land.[10][12][13]\\r\\nThe several states ratified the Articles of Confederation on the following dates:[14]\\r\\nThe Articles of Confederation contain a preamble, thirteen articles, a conclusion, and a signatory section. The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederation's central government. Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national Congress, which was empowered to make war and peace, negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and to resolve disputes between the states. The document also stipulates that its provisions \\"shall be inviolably observed by every state\\" and that \\"the Union shall be perpetual\\".\\r\\nSummary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles:\\r\\nUnder the Articles, Congress had the authority to regulate and fund the Continental Army, but it lacked the power to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, and even food.[16] Further, although the Articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers, as a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure; Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:\\r\\nGeorge Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.[17]","input":""},{"output":"58.28%","context":"The Eastern United States, commonly referred to as the American East or simply the East, is a region roughly coinciding with the boundaries of the United States established in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which bounded the new country to the west along the Mississippi River.

He was a direct descendant of Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (Tamurlane) from the Barlas clan, through his father, and also a descendant of Genghis Khan through his mother. He was also influenced by the Persian culture and this affected both his own actions and those of his successors, giving rise to a significant expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent.[4][5]\\r\\nBabur was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza. He ascended the throne of Fergana in 1495 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion from his own relatives. He conquered Samarkand two years later, only to lose the city of Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both cities went in vain as he was defeated by Muhammad Shaybani Khan. In 1504, he conquered Kabul, which was under the rule of the infant heir of Ulugh Begh. Babur formed a partnership with Safavid ruler Ismail I and reconquered parts of central Asia, including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Uzbeks.\\r\\nAfter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to creating his empire in north India. At that time, the Indo-Gangetic Plain of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by Ibrahim Lodi of the Afghan Lodi dynasty, whereas Rajputana was ruled by a Hindu Rajput Confederacy, led by Rana Sanga of Mewar. In 1524, Daulat Khan Lodi, a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty, invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the First Battle of Panipat in 1526 and founded the Mughal empire. However, he again faced opposition, this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar who considered Babur a foreigner. The Rana was defeated in the Battle of Khanwa.\\r\\nBabur married several times. Notable among his sons are Humayun, Kamran Mirza and Hindal Mirza. Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun. According to Babur's wishes, he was buried in Bagh-e-Babur in Kabul, Afghanistan. Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and Turk, though Uzbek sources claim him as an ethnic Uzbek. He is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Many of his poems also have become popular folk songs. He wrote his autobiography, Baburnama, in Chaghatai Turkic and this was translated into Persian during Akbar's reign.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?ahؐr-ud-Dؐn is Arabic for \\"Defender of the Faith\\" (of Islam), and Muhammad honours the Islamic prophet.\\r\\nThe difficulty of pronouncing the name for his Central Asian Turco-Mongol army may have been responsible for the greater popularity of his nickname Babur,[6] also variously spelled Baber,[2] Babar,[7] and Bbor.[4] The name is generally taken in reference to the Persian babr, meaning \\"tiger\\".[2][3] The word repeatedly appears in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh and was borrowed into the Turkic languages of Central Asia.[7][8] Thackston argues for an alternate derivation from the PIE word \\"beaver\\", pointing to similarities between the pronunciation Bbor and the Russian bobr (ɾɰ, \\"beaver\\").[9]\\r\\nBabur bore the royal titles Badshah and al-?ultnu 'l-?azam wa 'l-?qn al-mukkarram pdshh-e ?zؐ. He and later Mughal emperors used the title of mirza when they were princes (see imperial and royal titles of the Mughal emperors).\\r\\nBabur's memoirs form the main source for details of his life. They are known as the Baburnama and were written in Chaghatai Turkic, his mother-tongue,[10] though, according to Dale, \\"his Turkic prose is highly Persianized in its sentence structure, morphology or word formation and vocabulary.\\"[3] Baburnama was translated into Persian during the rule of Babur's grandson Akbar.[10]\\r\\nBabur was born on 14 February 1483 in the city of Andijan, Andijan Province, Fergana Valley, contemporary Uzbekistan. He was the eldest son of Umar Sheikh Mirza,[11] ruler of the Fergana Valley, the son of Ab Sa?ؐd Mirza (and grandson of Miran Shah, who was himself son of Timur) and his wife Qutlugh Nigar Khanum, daughter of Yunus Khan, the ruler of Moghulistan (and great-great grandson of Tughlugh Timur, the son of Esen Buqa I, who was the great-great-great grandson of Chaghatai Khan, the second-born son of Genghis Khan).[12]\\r\\nBabur hailed from the Barlas tribe, which was of Mongol origin and had embraced Turkic[13] and Persian culture.[14] They had also converted to Islam centuries earlier and resided in Turkestan and Khorasan. Aside from the Chaghatai language, Babur was equally fluent in Persian, the lingua franca of the Timurid elite.[15]\\r\\nHence, Babur, though nominally a Mongol (or Moghul in Persian language), drew much of his support from the local Turkic and Iranian people of Central Asia, and his army was diverse in its ethnic makeup. It included Persians (known to Babur as \\"Sarts\\" and \\"Tajiks\\"), ethnic Afghans, Arabs, as well as Barlas and Chaghatayid Turko-Mongols from Central Asia.[16]\\r\\nIn 1494, at eleven years old, Babur became the ruler of Fergana, in present-day Uzbekistan, after Umar Sheikh Mirza died \\"while tending pigeons in an ill-constructed dovecote that toppled into the ravine below the palace\\".[17] During this time, two of his uncles from the neighbouring kingdoms, who were hostile to his father, and a group of nobles who wanted his younger brother Jahangir to be the ruler, threatened his succession to the throne.[6] His uncles were relentless in their attempts to dislodge him from this position as well as from many of his other territorial possessions to come.[18] Babur was able to secure his throne mainly because of help from his maternal grandmother, Aisan Daulat Begum, although there was also some luck involved.[6]\\r\\nMost territories around his kingdom were ruled by his relatives, who were descendants of either Timur or Genghis Khan, and were constantly in conflict.[6] At that time, rival princes were fighting over the city of Samarkand to the west, which was ruled by his paternal cousin.[citation needed] Babur had a great ambition to capture the city. In 1497 he besieged Samarkand for seven months before eventually gaining control over it.[19] He was fifteen years old and for him the campaign was a huge achievement.[6] Babur was able to hold the city despite desertions in his army, but he later fell seriously ill.[citation needed] Meanwhile, a rebellion back home, approximately 350 kilometres (220?mi) away, amongst nobles who favoured his brother, robbed him of Fergana.[19] As he was marching to recover it, he lost Samarkand to a rival prince, leaving him with neither.[6] He had held Samarkand for 100 days, and he considered this defeat as his biggest loss, obsessing over it even later in his life after his conquests in India.[6]\\r\\nIn 1501, Babur laid siege to Samarkand once more, but was soon defeated by his most formidable rival, Muhammad Shaybani, Khan of the Uzbeks.[19][20] Samarkand, his lifelong obsession, was lost again. He tried to reclaim Fergana but lost it too and escaping with a small band of followers, he wandered to the mountains of central Asia and took refuge with hill tribes. Thus, during the ten years since becoming the ruler of Fergana, Babur suffered many short-lived victories and was without shelter and in exile, aided by friends and peasants.[21] He finally stayed in Tashkent, which was ruled by his maternal uncle. Babur wrote, \\"During my stay in Tashkent, I endured much poverty and humiliation. No country, or hope of one!\\"[21] For three years Babur concentrated on building up a strong army, recruiting widely amongst the Tajiks of Badakhshan in particular. By 1502, he had resigned all hopes of recovering Fergana; he was left with nothing and was forced to try his luck someplace else.[22]\\r\\nKabul was ruled by Ulugh Begh Mirza of the Arghun Dynasty, who died leaving only an infant as heir.[21] The city was then claimed by Mukin Begh, who was considered to be a usurper and was opposed by the local populace. In 1504, Babur was able to cross the snowy Hindu Kush mountains and capture Kabul from the remaining Arghunids, who were forced to retreat to Kandahar.[19] With this move, he gained a new kingdom, re-established his fortunes and would remain its ruler until 1526.[22] In 1505, because of the low revenue generated by his new mountain kingdom, Babur began his first expedition to India; in his memoirs, he wrote, \\"My desire for Hindustan had been constant. It was in the month of Shaban, the Sun being in Aquarius, that we rode out of Kabul for Hindustan\\". It was a brief raid across the Khyber Pass.[21]\\r\\nIn the same year, Babur united with Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqarah of Herat, a fellow Timurid and distant relative, against their common enemy, the Uzbek Shaybani.[23] However, this venture did not take place because Husayn Mirza died in 1506 and his two sons were reluctant to go to war.[21] Babur instead stayed at Herat after being invited by the two Mirza brothers. It was then the cultural capital of the eastern Muslim world. Though he was disgusted by the vices and luxuries of the city,[24] he marvelled at the intellectual abundance there, which he stated was \\"filled with learned and matched men\\".[25] He became acquainted with the work of the Chagatai poet Mir Ali Shir Nava'i, who encouraged the use of Chagatai as a literary language. Nava'i's proficiency with the language, which he is credited with founding,[26] may have influenced Babur in his decision to use it for his memoirs. He spent two months there before being forced to leave because of diminishing resources;[23] it later was overrun by Shaybani and the Mirzas fled.[24]\\r\\nBabur became the only reigning ruler of the Timurid dynasty after the loss of Herat, and many princes sought refuge from him at Kabul because of Shaybani's invasion in the west.[24] He thus assumed the title of Padshah (emperor) among the Timuridsthough this tile was insignificant since most of his ancestral lands were taken, Kabul itself was in danger and Shaybani continued to be a threat.[24] Babur prevailed during a potential rebellion in Kabul, but two years later a revolt among some of his leading generals drove him out of Kabul. Escaping with very few companions, Babur soon returned to the city, capturing Kabul again and regaining the allegiance of the rebels. Meanwhile, Shaybani was defeated and killed by Ismail I, Shah of Shia Safavid Persia, in 1510.[27]\\r\\nBabur and the remaining Timurids used this opportunity to reconquer their ancestral territories. Over the following few years, Babur and Shah Ismail formed a partnership in an attempt to take over parts of Central Asia. In return for Ismail's assistance, Babur permitted the Safavids to act as a suzerain over him and his followers.[28] Thus, in 1513, after leaving his brother Nasir Mirza to rule Kabul, he managed to take Samarkand for the third time; he also took Bokhara but lost both again to the Uzbeks.[22][24] Shah Ismail reunited Babur with his sister Khnzda, who had been imprisoned by and forced to marry the recently deceased Shaybani.[29] Babur returned to Kabul after three years in 1514. The following 11 years of his rule mainly involved dealing with relatively insignificant rebellions from Afghan tribes, his nobles and relatives, in addition to conducting raids across the eastern mountains.[24] Babur began to modernise and train his army despite it being, for him, relatively peaceful times.[30]\\r\\nBabur began relations with the Safavids when he met Ali Mirza Safavi at Samarkand; their good relations lasted even after Babur was approached by the Ottomans. The Safavids army led by Najm-e Sani massacred civilians in Central Asia and then sought the assistance of Babur, who advised the Safavids to withdraw. The Safavids, however, refused and were defeated during the Battle of Ghazdewan by the warlord Ubaydullah Khan.[31]\\r\\nBabur's early relations with the Ottomans were poor because the Ottoman Sultan Selim I provided his rival Ubaydullah Khan with powerful matchlocks and cannons.[32] In 1507, when ordered to accept Selim I as his rightful suzerain, Babur refused and gathered Qizilbash servicemen in order to counter the forces of Ubaydullah Khan during the Battle of Ghazdewan. In 1513, Selim I reconciled with Babur (fearing that he would join the Safavids), dispatched Ustad Ali Quli the artilleryman and Mustafa Rumi the matchlock marksman, and many other Ottoman Turks, in order to assist Babur in his conquests; this particular assistance proved to be the basis of future Mughal-Ottoman relations.[33] From them, he also adopted the tactic of using matchlocks and cannons in field (rather than only in sieges), which would give him an important advantage in India.[30]\\r\\nBabur still wanted to escape from the Uzbeks, and he chose India as a refuge instead of Badakhshan, which was to the north of Kabul. He wrote, \\"In the presence of such power and potency, we had to think of some place for ourselves and, at this crisis and in the crack of time there was, put a wider space between us and the strong foeman.\\"[30] After his third loss of Samarkand, Babur gave full attention to the conquest of North India, launching a campaign; he reached Chenab, now in Pakistan, in 1519.[22] Until 1524, his aim was to only expand his rule to Punjab, mainly to fulfill the legacy of his ancestor Timur, since it used to be part of his empire.[30] At the time parts of north India were under the rule of Ibrahim Lodi of the Lodi dynasty, but the empire was crumbling and there were many defectors. He received invitations from Daulat Khan Lodi, Governor of Punjab and Ala-ud-Din, uncle of Ibrahim.[34] He sent an ambassador to Ibrahim, claiming himself the rightful heir to the throne, but the ambassador was detained at Lahore and released months later.[22]\\r\\nBabur started for Lahore, Punjab, in 1524 but found that Daulat Khan Lodi had been driven out by forces sent by Ibrahim Lodi.[35] When Babur arrived at Lahore, the Lodi army marched out and his army was routed.[36] In response, Babur burned Lahore for two days, then marched to Dipalpur, placing Alam Khan, another rebel uncle of Lodi, as governor.[37] Alam Khan was quickly overthrown and fled to Kabul. In response, Babur supplied Alam Khan with troops who later joined up with Daulat Khan Lodi, and together with about 30,000 troops, they besieged Ibrahim Lodi at Delhi.[38] He easily defeated and drove off Alam's army and Babur realised Lodi would not allow him to occupy the Punjab.[38]\\r\\nIn November 1525 Babur got news at Peshawar that Daulat Khan Lodi had switched sides, and he drove out Ala-ud-Din.[clarification needed] Babur then marched onto Lahore to confront Daulat Khan Lodi, only to see Daulat's army melt away at their approach.[22] Daulat surrendered and was pardoned. Thus within three weeks of crossing the Indus River Babur had become the master of Punjab.[39]\\r\\nBabur marched on to Delhi via Sirhind. He reached Panipat on 20 April 1526 and there met Ibrahim Lodi's numerically superior army of about 100,000 soldiers and 100 elephants.[22][34] In the battle that began on the following day, Babur used the tactic of Tulugma, encircling Ibrahim Lodi's army and forcing it to face artillery fire directly, as well as frightening its war elephants.[34] Ibrahim Lodi died during the battle, thus ending the Lodi dynasty.[22]\\r\\nBabur wrote in his memoirs about his victory:\\r\\nBy the grace of the Almighty God, this difficult task was made easy to me and that mighty army, in the space of a half a day was laid in dust.[22]\\r\\nAfter the battle, Babur occupied Delhi and Agra, took the throne of Lodi, and laid the foundation for the eventual rise of Mughal rule in India. However, before he became North India's ruler, he had to fend off challengers, such as Rana Sanga.[40]\\r\\nThe Battle of Khanwa was fought between Babur and the Rajput ruler Rana Sanga on 17 March 1527. Rana Sanga wanted to overthrow Babur, whom he considered to be a foreigner ruling in India, and also to extend the Rajput territories by annexing Delhi and Agra. He was supported by Afghan chiefs who felt Babur had been deceptive by refusing to fulfill promises made to them. Upon receiving news of Rana Sangha's advance towards Agra, Babur took a defensive position at Khanwa (currently in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh), from where he hoped to launch a counterattack later. According to K.V. Krishna Rao, Babur won the battle because of his \\"superior generalship\\" and modern tactics: the battle was one of the first in India that featured cannons. Rao also notes that Rana Sanga faced \\"treachery\\" when a Silhadi man converted to Islam and joined Babur's army with a garrison of 6,000 soldiers.[41]\\r\\nThere are no descriptions about Babur's physical appearance, except from the paintings in the translation of the Baburnama prepared during the reign of Akbar.[21] In his autobiography, Babur claimed to be strong and physically fit, and claimed to have swum across every major river he encountered, including twice across the Ganges River in North India.[42] Unlike his father, he had ascetic tendencies and did not have any great interest in women. In his first marriage, he was \\"bashful\\" towards Aisha Sultan Begum, later losing his affection for her.[43] However, he acquired several more wives and concubines over the years, and as required for a prince, he was able to ensure the continuity of his line; Babur treated them and his other women relatives well. In his memoirs, there is a mention of his infatuation for a younger boy when Babur was 16 years old.[30] According to the historian Abraham Eraly, bisexuality was common and pederasty high fashion among the central Asian aristocrats of the time.[44]\\r\\nBabur's first wife, Aisha Sultan Begum, was his paternal cousin, the daughter of Sultan Ahmad Mirza, his father's brother. She was an infant when betrothed to Babur, who was himself five years old. They married eleven years later, c.?1498ÿ99. The couple had one daughter, Fakhr-un-Nissa, who died within a year in 1500. Three years later, after Babur's first defeat at Fergana, Aisha left him and returned to her father's household.[45][30] In 1504, Babur married Zaynab Sultan Begum, who died childless within two years. In the period 1506ÿ08, Babur married four women, Maham Begum (in 1506), Masuma Sultan Begum, Gulrukh Begum and Dildar Begum.[45] Babur had four children by Maham Begum, of whom only one survived infancy. This was his eldest son and heir, Humayun. Masuma Sultan Begum died during childbirth; the year of her death is disputed (either 1508 or 1519). Gulrukh bore Babur two sons, Kamran and Askari, and Dildar Begum was the mother of Babur's youngest son, Hindal.[45] Babur later married Mubaraka Yusufzai, a Pashtun woman of the Yusufzai tribe. Gulnar Aghacha and Nargul Aghacha were two Circassian slaves given to Babur as gifts by Tahmasp Shah Safavi, the Shah of Persia. They became \\"recognized ladies of the royal household.\\"[45]\\r\\nDuring his rule in Kabul, when there was a time of relative peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening.[30] Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from opium.[24] Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: \\"I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober\\". He quit drinking for health reasons before the Battle of Khanwa, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same.

He wrote, \\"Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of abstinence); I swore the oath and regret that.\\"[46]\\r\\nBabur died at the age of 47 on 5 January?[O.S. 26 December 1530]?1531 and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun\\r\\nAfter death, his body was moved to Kabul, Afghanistan, where it lies in Bagh-e Babur (Babur Gardens).[47]\\r\\nIt is generally agreed that, as a Timurid, Babur was not only significantly influenced by the Persian culture, but that his empire also gave rise to the expansion of the Persianate ethos in the Indian subcontinent.[4][5]\\r\\nFor example, F. Lehmann states in the Encyclop?dia Iranica:\\r\\nHis origin, milieu, training, and culture were steeped in Persian culture and so Babur was largely responsible for the fostering of this culture by his descendants, the Mughals of India, and for the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and historiographical results.[14]\\r\\nAlthough all applications of modern Central Asian ethnicities to people of Babur's time are anachronistic, Soviet and Uzbek sources regard Babur as an ethnic Uzbek.[48][49][50] At the same time, during the Soviet Union Uzbek scholars were censored for idealising and praising Babur and other historical figures such as Ali-Shir Nava'i.[51]\\r\\nBabur is considered a national hero in Uzbekistan.[52] On 14 February 2008, stamps in his name were issued in the country to commemorate his 525th birth anniversary.[53] Many of Babur's poems have become popular Uzbek folk songs, especially by Sherali Jo'rayev.[54] Some sources claim that Babur is a national hero in Kyrgyzstan too.[55] In October 2005, Pakistan developed the Babur Cruise Missile, named in his honour.\\r\\nOne of the enduring features of Babur's life was that he left behind the lively and well-written autobiography known as Baburnama.[9] Quoting Henry Beveridge, Stanley Lane-Poole writes:\\r\\nHis autobiography is one of those priceless records which are for all time, and is fit to rank with the confessions of St. Augustine and Rousseau, and the memoirs of Gibbon and Newton. In Asia it stands almost alone.[56]\\r\\nIn his own words, \\"The cream of my testimony is this, do nothing against your brothers even though they may deserve it.\\" Also, \\"The new year, the spring, the wine and the beloved are joyful. Babur make merry, for the world will not be there for you a second time.\\"[57]\\r\\nBabri Masjid (\\"Babur's Mosque\\") in Ayodhya, India was constructed on the orders of Mir Baqi, one of Babur's generals who led forces sent to the region during his reign. In 2003, by the order of an Indian Court, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) was asked to conduct a more indepth study and an excavation to ascertain the type of structure that was beneath the mosque.[58] The excavation was conducted from 12 March 2003 to 7 August 2003, resulting in 1360 discoveries. The ASI submitted its report to the Allahabad high court.[59]\\r\\nThe summary of the ASI report indicated the presence of a 10th-century temple under the mosque.[60][61] According to the ASI team, the human activity at the site dates back to the 13th century BCE. The next few layers date back to the Shunga period (second-first century BCE) and the Kushan period. During the early medieval period (11ÿ12th century CE), a huge but short-lived structure of nearly 50 metres north-south orientation was constructed. On the remains of this structure, another massive structure was constructed: this structure had at least three structural phases and three successive floors attached with it. The report concluded that it was over the top of this construction that the disputed structure was constructed during the early 16th century.[62]","input":"What was the mother tongue of the mughals?"},{"output":"August 15, 2010","context":"The Great Food Truck Race is a reality television and cooking series that originally aired on August 15, 2010, on Food Network, with Tyler Florence as the host.[2] Billed as a cross between Cannonball Run and Top Chef[3], this late summer show features several competing teams of three who drive across the United States in their food trucks and make stops every week to sell food in different cities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery season, between six and eight food truck teams compete in a race where they must cook, sell, and adapt to different challenges in the hopes of winning $50,000 (and in some cases, their very own food truck).

They're usually given \\"seed money\\" at the beginning of each episode that goes towards grocery shopping. The teams are assigned different challenges every week for a chance to earn more money (usually in the form of selling the most of a special dish or making a version of a local delicacy for Tyler and a guest judge). They're also thrown obstacles that hinder their ability to make normal sales (examples: switching their menu to vegan food or being unable to restock supplies for the day.)\\r\\nIn the first two seasons of the Great Food Truck Race, the competitors were seasoned, professional food truck operators who were competing for a cash prize (first season was $50,000 and second season was $100,000). In the following seasons (save for season six), food trucks were provided to novices (from home cooks to former restaurateurs) who have dreamt of owning and operating their very own food truck. In seasons three, four, and five, the winning team got the money and got to keep the food truck they were provided by the show. In season six and onward, the show reverted to awarding the winning teams only the $50,000.\\r\\nBob Tuschman, general manager of the Food Network, had gotten several pitches for a food truck themed competition show before settling on the show that would become The Great Food Truck Race.

There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use starting birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1940s and ending birth years ranging from 1960 to 1964.\\r\\nThe term \\"baby boomer\\" is also used in a cultural context, so it is difficult to achieve broad consensus of a precise date definition. Different people, organizations, and scholars have varying opinions on who is a baby boomer, both technically and culturally. Ascribing universal attributes to such a generation is difficult, and some believe it is inherently impossible, but many have attempted to determine their cultural similarities and historical impact, and the term has thus gained widespread popular usage.\\r\\nBaby boomers are associated with a rejection or redefinition of traditional values. Many commentators, however, have disputed the extent of that rejection, noting the widespread continuity of values with older and younger generations. In Europe and North America, boomers are widely associated with privilege, as many grew up in a time of widespread government subsidies in post-war housing and education, and increasing affluence.[1]\\r\\nAs a group, baby boomers were the wealthiest, most active, and most physically fit generation up to the era in which they arrived, and were amongst the first to grow up genuinely expecting the world to improve with time.[2] They were also the generation that received peak levels of income; they could therefore reap the benefits of abundant levels of food, apparel, retirement programs, and sometimes even \\"midlife crisis\\" products. The increased consumerism for this generation has been regularly criticized as excessive.[3]\\r\\nOne feature of the boomers was that they have tended to think of themselves as a special generation, very different from those that had come before. In the 1960s, as the relatively large numbers of young people became teenagers and young adults, they, and those around them, created a very specific rhetoric around their cohort, and the changes they were bringing about.[4] This rhetoric had an important impact in the self perceptions of the boomers, as well as their tendency to define the world in terms of generations, which was a relatively new phenomenon. The baby boom has been described variously as a \\"shockwave\\"[1] and as \\"the pig in the python.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe term \\"Generation Jones\\" is sometimes used to describe those born roughly between 1954 and 1964. The term is typically used to refer to the later years of the Baby boomer cohort and the early years of Generation X.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase baby boom refers to a noticeable increase in the birth rate. The post-war population increase was first described as a \\"boom\\" by Sylvia F. Porter in a column in the May 4, 1951, edition of the New York Post, based on the increase in the population of the U.S. of 2,357,000 in 1950.[8] According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first recorded use of \\"baby boomer\\" is from 1970 in an article in The Washington Post.[9] Various authors have delimited the baby boom period differently. Landon Jones, in his book Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation (1980), defined the span of the baby-boom generation as extending from 1943 through 1960, when annual births increased over 4,000,000. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, well known for their generational theory, define the social generation of Boomers as that cohort born from 1943 to 1960, who were too young to have any personal memory of World War II, but old enough to remember the postwar American High.[10]\\r\\nIn the U.S., the generation can be segmented into two broadly defined cohorts: The Leading-Edge Baby Boomers are individuals born between 1946 and 1955, those who came of age during the Vietnam War era. This group represents slightly more than half of the generation, or roughly 38,002,000 people of all races. The other half of the generation was born between 1956 and 1964. Called Late Boomers, or Trailing-Edge Boomers, this second cohort includes about 37,818,000 individuals, according to Live Births by Age and Mother and Race, 1933ÿ98, published by the Center for Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics.[11]\\r\\nAn ongoing battle for \\"generational ownership\\" has motivated a handful of marketing mavens and cultural commentators to coin and/or promote their own terms for sub?segments of the baby-boomer generation. These monikers include, but are not limited to, \\"golden boomers\\", \\"generation Jones\\", \\"alpha boomers\\", \\"hippies\\", \\"yippies\\", \\"yuppies\\", \\"zoomers\\", and \\"cuspers.\\" Advocates of these \\"cultural segments\\" are often zealous and overstated in their attempts to redefine generational boundaries, often claiming wide adoption and sometimes advancing self-promotional agendas.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Ontario, Canada, one attempt to define the boom came from David Foot, author of Boom, Bust and Echo: Profiting from the Demographic Shift in the 21st?century (1997). He defines a Canadian boomer as someone born from 1947 to 1966, the years that more than 400,000 babies were born. However, he acknowledges that is a demographic definition, and that culturally it may not be as clear-cut.[12]\\r\\nDoug Owram argues that the Canadian boom took place from 1943 to 1960, but that culturally boomers everywhere were born between the late war years and about 1955 or 1956. He notes that those born in the years before the actual boom were often the most influential people among boomers; for example, musicians such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones, or writers like Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, who were either slightly or vastly older than the boomer generation. Those born in the 1960s might feel disconnected from the cultural identifiers of the earlier boomers.[13]\\r\\nBernard Salt places the Australian baby boom between 1943 and 1960,[14][15] while the Australian Bureau of Statistics defines the boom as 1946 to 1964.[16]\\r\\n76 million American children were born between 1946 and 1964, representing a cohort that is significant on account of its size alone. In 2004, the British baby boomers held 80% of the UK's wealth and bought 80% of all top of the range cars, 80% of cruises and 50% of skincare products.[17]\\r\\nIn addition to the size of the group, Steve Gillon has suggested that one thing that sets the baby boomers apart from other generational groups is the fact that \\"almost from the time they were conceived, Boomers were dissected, analyzed, and pitched to by modern marketers, who reinforced a sense of generational distinctiveness.\\"[18] This is supported by the articles of the late 1940s identifying the increasing number of babies as an economic boom, such as a 1948 Newsweek article whose title proclaimed \\"Babies Mean Business\\",[19] or a 1948 Time magazine article called \\"Baby Boom.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe age wave theory suggests an economic slowdown when the boomers started retiring during 2007ÿ2009.[21] Projections for the aging U.S.?workforce suggest that by 2020, 25% of employees will be at least 55 years old.[22]\\r\\nA survey found that nearly a third of baby boomer multimillionaires polled in the United States would prefer to pass on their inheritance to charities rather than pass it down to their children. Fifty-seven percent of these boomers believed it was important for each generation to earn their own money; fifty four percent believed it was more important to invest in their children while they were growing up.[23]\\r\\nBoomers grew up at a time of dramatic social change. In the United States, that change marked the generation with a strong cultural cleavage, between the proponents of change and the more conservative individuals. Some analysts believe this cleavage played out politically since the time of the Vietnam War to the mid?2000s, to some extent defining the political landscape and division in the country.[24][25] Starting in the 1980s, the boomers became more conservative, many of them regretting the cultural changes they brought in their youth.[26]\\r\\nIn 1993, Time magazine reported on the religious affiliations of baby boomers. Citing Wade Clark Roof, a sociologist at the University of California at Santa Barbara, the articles stated that about 42% of baby boomers were dropouts from formal religion, 33% had never strayed from church, and 25% of boomers were returning to religious practice. The boomers returning to religion were \\"usually less tied to tradition and less dependable as church members than the loyalists. They are also more liberal, which deepens rifts over issues like abortion and homosexuality.\\"[27]\\r\\nThe early and mid-boomers were coming of age at the same time across the world, so that they experienced events like Beatlemania and Woodstock, organizing against the Vietnam War, or fighting and dying in the same war. Boomers in Italy were dressing in mod clothes and \\"buying the world a Coke.\\" Boomers in India were seeking new philosophical discoveries.[citation needed] Some American boomers in Canada had found a new home after escaping the draft. Canadian Boomers were organizing support for Pierre Trudeau. It is precisely because of these experiences that many believe those born in the second half of the birth boom belong to another generation, as events that defined their coming of age have little in common with leading or core boomers.[original research?] Politically, early Boomers in the United States tend to be Democrats, while later boomers tend to be Republicans.[28]\\r\\nThe baby boomers found that their music, most notably rock and roll, was another expression of their generational identity. Transistor radios were personal devices that allowed teenagers to listen to The Beatles, the Motown Sound, and other new musical directions and artists.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the west, baby boomers comprised the first generation to grow up with the television; some popular Boomer-era shows included Howdy Doody, The Mickey Mouse Club, Captain Video, The Soupy Sales Show, The Brady Bunch, Gilligan's Island, The Twilight Zone, Batman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Star Trek, The Ed Sullivan Show, All in the Family and Happy Days.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the 1985 study of U.S.?generational cohorts by Schuman and Scott, a broad sample of adults was asked, \\"What world events over the past 50 years were especially important to them?\\"[29] For the baby boomers the results were:\\r\\nThere is often debate regarding the generational identity of those born from 1961 to 1964. Some demographers and researchers consider these individuals to be part of the younger demographic cohort, Generation X.[30][31][32][33]\\r\\nThe density of Baby Boomers can put a strain on Medicare. According to the American Medical Student Association, the population of individuals over the age of 65 will increase by 73 percent between 2010 and 2030, meaning one in five Americans will be a senior citizen.[34]\\r\\nAs of 1998[update], it was reported that, as a generation, boomers had tended to avoid discussions and planning for their demise and avoided much long-term planning.[35] However, beginning at least as early as that year, there has been a growing dialogue on how to manage aging and end-of-life issues as the generation ages.[36] In particular, a number of commentators have argued that Baby Boomers are in a state of denial regarding their own aging and death and are leaving an undue economic burden on their children for their retirement and care. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:\\r\\nIn 2013, the early baby boomers (depending on birth years used) reached a common retirement age in the United States: 67 years.\\r\\nAn indication of the importance put on the impact of the boomer was the selection by TIME magazine of the Baby Boom Generation as its 1966 \\"Man of the Year.\\" As Claire Raines points out in Beyond Generation?X, \\"never before in history had youth been so idealized as they were at this moment.\\" When Generation?X came along it had much to live up to in according to Raines.[39]\\r\\nBoomers are often associated with the counterculture of the 1960s, the civil rights movement, and the \\"second-wave\\" feminist cause of the 1970s. Conversely, many trended in moderate to conservative directions opposite to the counterculture, especially those making professional careers in the military (officer and enlisted), law enforcement, business, blue collar trades, and Republican Party politics. They are also associated with the spending trends and narcissism of the \\"Me\\" generation.\\r\\nPeople often take it for granted that each succeeding generation will be \\"better off\\" than the one before it. When Generation X came along just after the boomers, they would be the first generation to enjoy a lesser quality of life than the generation preceding it.[40][41][42][43]\\r\\nBaby boomers continue to have a big effect on politics, as the United States presidential election, 2016 came down to two controversial candidates in Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, both boomers, with a majority of Trump's support coming from the Baby Boomer generation.[44][45] Three American presidents were born in 1946: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"Who is considered to be a baby boomer?"},{"output":"at chip shops in Scotland","context":"A deep-fried Mars bar is an ordinary Mars bar normally fried in a type of batter commonly used for deep-frying fish, sausages, and other battered products.

Deep-fried Snickers have also been reported, particularly in the United States where that brand is more popular.[9]  In her book and television series Nigella Bites, Nigella Lawson includes a recipe for a deep-fried Bounty bar.[10] Deep-fried Moro bars are also sold in New Zealand, where the brand is popular.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it was first reported in the media in August 1995, when the Daily Record ran an article entitled \\"Scotland's craziest takeaway\\",[5][6] the deep-fried Mars bar has become a media-totem for ill health, obesity and high-fat diets.[5] The original article was quickly followed up by other UK publications, with the food portrayed to speak eloquently about Scotland's and the wider UK's poor diet, and resultant levels of obesity.[5][6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the Haven sought an application for secured status under the EU's Protected Food Name Scheme.

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1] was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation, insofar as it applied to public education. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court's unanimous (9ÿ0) decision stated that \\"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\\" As a result, de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement,[2] and a model for many future impact litigation cases.[3] However, the decision's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II (349 U.S. 294 (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate \\"with all deliberate speed\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor much of the sixty years preceding the Brown case, race relations in the United States had been dominated by racial segregation. This policy had been endorsed in 1896 by the United States Supreme Court case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which held that as long as the separate facilities for the separate races were equal, segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment (\\"no State shall ... deny to any person ... the equal protection of the laws\\").\\r\\nThe plaintiffs in Brown asserted that this system of racial separation, while masquerading as providing separate but equal treatment of both white and black Americans, instead perpetuated inferior accommodations, services, and treatment for black Americans. Racial segregation in education varied widely from the 17 states that required racial segregation to the 16 in which it was prohibited. Brown was influenced by UNESCO's 1950 Statement, signed by a wide variety of internationally renowned scholars, titled The Race Question.[4] This declaration denounced previous attempts at scientifically justifying racism as well as morally condemning racism. Another work that the Supreme Court cited was Gunnar Myrdal's An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy (1944).[5] Myrdal had been a signatory of the UNESCO declaration. The research performed by the educational psychologists Kenneth B. Clark and Mamie Phipps Clark also influenced the Court's decision.[6] The Clarks' \\"doll test\\" studies presented substantial arguments to the Supreme Court about how segregation affected black schoolchildren's mental status.[7]\\r\\nThe United States and the Soviet Union were both at the height of the Cold War during this time, and U.S. officials, including Supreme Court Justices, were highly aware of the harm that segregation and racism played on America's international image. When Justice William O. Douglas traveled to India in 1950, the first question he was asked was, \\"Why does America tolerate the lynching of Negroes?\\" Douglas later wrote that he had learned from his travels that \\"the attitude of the United States toward its colored minorities is a powerful factor in our relations with India.\\" Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated to the Supreme Court by President Eisenhower, echoed Douglas's concerns in a 1954 speech to the American Bar Association, proclaiming that \\"Our American system like all others is on trial both at home and abroad, ... the extent to which we maintain the spirit of our constitution with its Bill of Rights, will in the long run do more to make it both secure and the object of adulation than the number of hydrogen bombs we stockpile.\\"[8][9]\\r\\nIn 1951, a class action suit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of Topeka, Kansas in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs were thirteen Topeka parents on behalf of their 20 children.[10]\\r\\nThe suit called for the school district to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of Education operated separate elementary schools under an 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and white students in 12 communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman McKinley Burnett; Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and Lucinda Todd.\\r\\nThe named plaintiff, Oliver L. Brown, was a parent, a welder in the shops of the Santa Fe Railroad, an assistant pastor at his local church, and an African American.[11] He was convinced to join the lawsuit by Scott, a childhood friend. Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6?km) away, while Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.[12][13]\\r\\nAs directed by the NAACP leadership, the parents each attempted to enroll their children in the closest neighborhood school in the fall of 1951. They were each refused enrollment and directed to the segregated schools.\\r\\nThe case \\"Oliver Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas\\" was named after Oliver Brown as a legal strategy to have a man at the head of the roster. The lawyers, and the National Chapter of the NAACP, also felt that having Mr. Brown at the head of the roster would be better received by the U.S. Supreme Court Justices. The 13 plaintiffs were: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton, Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, and Lucinda Todd.[14][15] The last surviving plaintiff, Zelma Henderson, died in Topeka, on May 20, 2008, at age 88.[16][17]\\r\\nThe District Court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, citing the U.S. Supreme Court precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), which had upheld a state law requiring \\"separate but equal\\" segregated facilities for blacks and whites in railway cars.[18] The three-judge District Court panel found that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect on negro children, but denied relief on the ground that the negro and white schools in Topeka were substantially equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricula, and educational qualifications of teachers.[19]\\r\\nThe case of Brown v. Board of Education as heard before the Supreme Court combined five cases: Brown itself, Briggs v. Elliott (filed in South Carolina), Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County (filed in Virginia), Gebhart v. Belton (filed in Delaware), and Bolling v. Sharpe (filed in Washington D.C.).\\r\\nAll were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, the only case of the five originating from a student protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton High School.[20] The Gebhart case was the only one where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.\\r\\nThe Kansas case was unique among the group in that there was no contention of gross inferiority of the segregated schools' physical plant, curriculum, or staff. The district court found substantial equality as to all such factors. The lower court, in its opinion, noted that, in Topeka, \\"the physical facilities, the curricula, courses of study, qualification and quality of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets of schools [were] comparable.\\"[21] The lower court observed that \\"colored children in many instances are required to travel much greater distances than they would be required to travel could they attend a white school\\" but also noted that the school district \\"transports colored children to and from school free of charge\\" and that \\"[n]o such service [was] provided to white children.\\"[21]\\r\\nIn the Delaware case the district court judge in Gebhart ordered that the black students be admitted to the white high school due to the substantial harm of segregation and the differences that made the separate schools unequal.\\r\\nThe NAACP's chief counsel, Thurgood Marshallwho was later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967argued the case before the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs. Assistant attorney general Paul Wilsonlater distinguished emeritus professor of law at the University of Kansasconducted the state's ambivalent defense in his first appellate argument.\\r\\nIn December 1952, the Justice Department filed a friend of the court brief in the case. The brief was unusual in its heavy emphasis on foreign-policy considerations of the Truman administration in a case ostensibly about domestic issues. Of the seven pages covering \\"the interest of the United States,\\" five focused on the way school segregation hurt the United States in the Cold War competition for the friendship and allegiance of non-white peoples in countries then gaining independence from colonial rule. Attorney General James P. McGranery noted that\\r\\nThe existence of discrimination against minority groups in the United States has an adverse effect upon our relations with other countries. Racial discrimination furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills.[22]\\r\\nThe brief also quoted a letter by Secretary of State Dean Acheson lamenting that\\r\\nThe United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of discrimination in this country.[23]\\r\\nBritish barrister and parliamentarian Anthony Lester has written that \\"Although the Court's opinion in Brown made no reference to these considerations of foreign policy, there is no doubt that they significantly influenced the decision.\\"[23]\\r\\nIn spring 1953, the Court heard the case but was unable to decide the issue and asked to rehear the case in fall 1953, with special attention to whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools for whites and blacks.[24]\\r\\nThe Court reargued the case at the behest of Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a stalling tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.\\r\\nConference notes and draft decisions illustrate the division of opinions before the decision was issued.[25] Justices Douglas, Black, Burton, and Minton were predisposed to overturn Plessy.[25] Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not issued desegregation legislation; Stanley F. Reed discussed incomplete cultural assimilation and states' rights and was inclined to the view that segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; Tom C. Clark wrote that \\"we had led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out.\\"[25] Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to judicial activism and expressed concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability.[25] Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as Chief Justice.[25] Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school systems following Mendez v. Westminster.[26] However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a White House dinner, where the president told him: \\"These [southern whites] are not bad people. All they are concerned about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown Negroes.\\" Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African American plaintiffs.[27][28][29]\\r\\nIn his reading of the unanimous decision, Justice Warren noted the adverse psychological effects that segregated schools had on African American children.[30] Brown's cite of the Kenneth and Mamie Doll Study was criticized by Justice Clarence Thomas in a later concurring opinion [31] for implying black inferiority. According to Susan Firestone, the study itself is dubious in conclusion and unreliable in reproduction.[32]\\r\\nWhile all but one justice personally rejected segregation, the judicial restraint faction questioned whether the Constitution gave the Court the power to order its end. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only a recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate confirmed his appointment.\\r\\nWarren convened a meeting of the justices, and presented to them the simple argument that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.\\r\\nAlthough most justices were immediately convinced, Warren spent some time after this famous speech convincing everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justices Jackson and Reed finally decided to drop their dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by all the members of the Court.[33] Reed was the last holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.[34]\\r\\nReporters who observed the court holding were surprised by two facts. First, the court made a unanimous decision. Prior to the ruling, there were reports that the court members were sharply divided and might not be able to agree. Second, the attendance of Justice Robert H. Jackson who had suffered a mild heart attack and was not expected to return to the bench until early June 1954. \\"Perhaps to emphasize the unanimity of the court, perhaps from a desire to be present when the history-making verdict was announced, Justice Jackson was in his accustomed seat when the court convened.\\"[35] Reporters also noted that former Secretary of State Dean Acheson (who had related the case to foreign policy considerations) and current Attorney General Herbert Brownell were in the courtroom.[36]\\r\\nThe key holding of the Court was that, even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers, segregation by itself was harmful to black students and unconstitutional. They found that a significant psychological and social disadvantage was given to black children from the nature of segregation itself, drawing on research conducted by Kenneth Clark assisted by June Shagaloff. This aspect was vital because the question was not whether the schools were \\"equal\\", which under Plessy they nominally should have been, but whether the doctrine of separate was constitutional. The justices answered with a strong \\"no\\":\\r\\n[D]oes segregation of children in public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other \\"tangible\\" factors may be equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities? We believe that it does. ...\\r\\n\\"Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored children. The effect is greater when it has the sanction of the law, for the policy of separating the races is usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the negro group. A sense of inferiority affects the motivation of a child to learn. Segregation with the sanction of law, therefore, has a tendency to [retard] the educational and mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some of the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school system.\\" ...\\r\\nThe Topeka junior high schools had been integrated since 1941. Topeka High School was integrated from its inception in 1871 and its sports teams from 1949 on.[37] The Kansas law permitting segregated schools allowed them only \\"below the high school level\\".[38]\\r\\nSoon after the district court decision, election outcomes and the political climate in Topeka changed. The Board of Education of Topeka began to end segregation in the Topeka elementary schools in August 1953, integrating two attendance districts. All the Topeka elementary schools were changed to neighborhood attendance centers in January 1956, although existing students were allowed to continue attending their prior assigned schools at their option.[39][40][41] Plaintiff Zelma Henderson, in a 2004 interview, recalled that no demonstrations or tumult accompanied desegregation in Topeka's schools:\\r\\n\\"They accepted it,\\" she said. \\"It wasn't too long until they integrated the teachers and principals.\\"[42]\\r\\nThe Topeka Public Schools administration building is named in honor of McKinley Burnett, NAACP chapter president who organized the case.[citation needed]\\r\\nMonroe Elementary was designated a U.S. National Historic Site unit of the National Park Service on October 26, 1992.\\r\\nNot everyone accepted the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In Virginia, Senator Harry F. Byrd, Sr. organized the Massive Resistance movement that included the closing of schools rather than desegregating them.[43] See, for example, The Southern Manifesto. For more implications of the Brown decision, see School integration in the United States.\\r\\nTexas Attorney General John Ben Shepperd organized a campaign to generate legal obstacles to implementation of desegregation.[44]\\r\\nIn 1957, Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus called out his state's National Guard to block black students' entry to Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight Eisenhower responded by deploying elements of the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to Arkansas and by federalizing Arkansas's National Guard.[45]\\r\\nAlso in 1957, Florida's response was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing the decision and declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt to overturn the ruling must be done by legal methods.\\r\\nIn Mississippi fear of violence prevented any plaintiff from bringing a school desegregation suit for the next nine years.[46] When Medgar Evers sued to desegregate Jackson, Mississippi schools in 1963 White Citizens Council member Byron De La Beckwith murdered him.[47] Two subsequent trials resulted in hung juries. Beckwith was not convicted of the murder until 1994.[48]\\r\\nIn 1963, Alabama Gov. George Wallace personally blocked the door to Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama to prevent the enrollment of two black students. This became the infamous Stand in the Schoolhouse Door[49] where Wallace personally backed his \\"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\\" policy that he had stated in his 1963 inaugural address.[50] He moved aside only when confronted by General Henry Graham of the Alabama National Guard, who was ordered by President John F. Kennedy to intervene.\\r\\nIn North Carolina, there was often a strategy of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May 18, 1954 the Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling. This was the result of the initiative of D. E. Hudgins Jr., a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney, who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles[how?] to the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.[51][52]\\r\\nIn Moberly, Missouri, the schools were desegregated, as ordered. However, after 1955, the African-American teachers from the local \\"negro school\\" were not retained; this was ascribed to poor performance. They appealed their dismissal in Naomi Brooks et al., Appellants, v. School District of City of Moberly, Missouri, Etc., et al.; but it was upheld, and SCOTUS declined to hear a further appeal.[53][54]\\r\\nMany Northern cities also had de facto segregation policies, which resulted in a vast gulf in educational resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new school had been built since the turn of the century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped stimulate activism among African-American parents like Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP, initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Brown's principles. Mallory and thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the boycott, some of the first freedom schools of the period were established. The city responded to the campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves contending with the problem of white flight, however.)[55][56]\\r\\nThe intellectual roots of Plessy v. Ferguson, the landmark United States Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of racial segregation in 1896 under the doctrine of \\"separate but equal\\" were, in part, tied to the scientific racism of the era.[57][58] However, the popular support for the decision was more likely a result of the racist beliefs held by many whites at the time.[59] In deciding Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court rejected the ideas of scientific racists about the need for segregation, especially in schools. The Court buttressed its holding by citing (in footnote 11) social science research about the harms to black children caused by segregated schools.\\r\\nBoth scholarly and popular ideas of hereditarianism played an important role in the attack and backlash that followed the Brown decision.[59] The Mankind Quarterly was founded in 1960, in part in response to the Brown decision.[60][61]\\r\\nWilliam Rehnquist wrote a memo titled \\"A Random Thought on the Segregation Cases\\" when he was a law clerk for Justice Robert H. Jackson in 1952, during early deliberations that led to the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: \\"I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed.\\" Rehnquist continued, \\"To the argument .?.?. that a majority may not deprive a minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities are.\\"[62] Rehnquist also argued for Plessy with other law clerks.[63]\\r\\nHowever, during his 1971 confirmation hearings, Rehnquist said, \\"I believe that the memorandum was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jackson's tentative views for his own use.\\" Justice Jackson had initially planned to join a dissent in Brown.[64] Later, at his 1986 hearings for the slot of Chief Justice, Rehnquist put further distance between himself and the 1952 memo: \\"The bald statement that Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed, was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time.\\"[65] In any event, while serving on the Supreme Court, Rehnquist made no effort to reverse or undermine the Brown decision, and frequently relied upon it as precedent.[66]\\r\\nChief Justice Warren's reasoning was broadly criticized by contemporary legal academics with Judge Learned Hand decrying that the Supreme Court had \\"assumed the role of a third legislative chamber\\"[67] and Herbert Wechsler finding Brown impossible to justify based on neutral principles.[68]\\r\\nSome aspects of the Brown decision are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, himself an African American, wrote in Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) that at the very least, Brown I has been misunderstood by the courts.\\r\\nBrown I did not say that \\"racially isolated\\" schools were inherently inferior; the harm that it identified was tied purely to de jure segregation, not de facto segregation. Indeed, Brown I itself did not need to rely upon any psychological or social-science research in order to announce the simple, yet fundamental truth that the Government cannot discriminate among its citizens on the basis of race. \\r\\nSegregation was not unconstitutional because it might have caused psychological feelings of inferiority. Public school systems that separated blacks and provided them with superior educational resources making blacks \\"feel\\" superior to whites sent to lesser schoolswould violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether or not the white students felt stigmatized, just as do school systems in which the positions of the races are reversed. Psychological injury or benefit is irrelevant \\r\\nGiven that desegregation has not produced the predicted leaps forward in black educational achievement, there is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment. () Because of their \\"distinctive histories and traditions,\\" black schools can function as the center and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership, success, and achievement.[69]\\r\\nSome Constitutional originalists, notably Raoul Berger in his influential 1977 book \\"Government by Judiciary,\\" make the case that Brown cannot be defended by reference to the original understanding of the 14th Amendment. They support this reading of the 14th amendment by noting that the Civil Rights Act of 1875 did not ban segregated schools and that the same Congress that passed the 14th Amendment also voted to segregate schools in the District of Columbia. Other originalists, including Michael W. McConnell, a federal judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in his article \\"Originalism and the Desegregation Decisions,\\" argue that the Radical Reconstructionists who spearheaded the 14th Amendment were in favor of desegregated southern schools.[70] Evidence supporting this interpretation of the 14th amendment has come from archived Congressional records showing that proposals for federal legislation which would enforce school integration were debated in Congress a few years following the amendment's ratification.[71]\\r\\nThe case also has attracted some criticism from more liberal authors, including some who say that Chief Justice Warren's reliance on psychological criteria to find a harm against segregated blacks was unnecessary. For example, Drew S. Days has written:[72] \\"we have developed criteria for evaluating the constitutionality of racial classifications that do not depend upon findings of psychic harm or social science evidence. They are based rather on the principle that 'distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,' Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943).?.?.?.\\"\\r\\nIn his book The Tempting of America (page 82), Robert Bork endorsed the Brown decision as follows:\\r\\nBy 1954, when Brown came up for decision, it had been apparent for some time that segregation rarely if ever produced equality. Quite aside from any question of psychology, the physical facilities provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites. That had been demonstrated in a long series of cases  The Court's realistic choice, therefore, was either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in order to achieve equality. There was no third choice. Either choice would violate one aspect of the original understanding, but there was no possibility of avoiding that. Since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit state-imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law.\\r\\nIn June 1987, Philip Elman, a civil rights attorney who served as an associate in the Solicitor General's office during Harry Truman's term, claimed he and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter were mostly responsible for the Supreme Court's decision, and stated that the NAACP's arguments did not present strong evidence.[73] Elman has been criticized for offering a self-aggrandizing history of the case, omitting important facts, and denigrating the work of civil rights attorneys who had laid the groundwork for the decision over many decades.[74] However, Frankfurter was also known for being one of court's most outspoken advocates of the judicial restraint philosophy of basing court rulings on existing law rather than personal or political considerations.[75][76] Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President George W. Bush spoke at the opening of the Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, calling Brown \\"a decision that changed America for the better, and forever.\\"[77] Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases hailing the ruling.\\r\\nIn an article in Townhall, Thomas Sowell argued that When Chief Justice Earl Warren declared in the landmark 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education that racially separate schools were \\"inherently unequal,\\" Dunbar High School was a living refutation of that assumption. And it was within walking distance of the Supreme Court.\\"[78]\\r\\nIn 1955, the Supreme Court considered arguments by the schools requesting relief concerning the task of desegregation. In their decision, which became known as \\"Brown II\\"[79] the court delegated the task of carrying out school desegregation to district courts with orders that desegregation occur \\"with all deliberate speed,\\" a phrase traceable to Francis Thompson's poem, The Hound of Heaven.[80]\\r\\nSupporters of the earlier decision were displeased with this decision. The language \\"all deliberate speed\\" was seen by critics as too ambiguous to ensure reasonable haste for compliance with the court's instruction. Many Southern states and school districts interpreted \\"Brown II\\" as legal justification for resisting, delaying, and avoiding significant integration for yearsand in some cases for a decade or moreusing such tactics as closing down school systems, using state money to finance segregated \\"private\\" schools, and \\"token\\" integration where a few carefully selected black children were admitted to former white-only schools but the vast majority remained in underfunded, unequal black schools.[81]\\r\\nFor example, based on \\"Brown II,\\" the U.S. District Court ruled that Prince Edward County, Virginia did not have to desegregate immediately. When faced with a court order to finally begin desegregation in 1959 the county board of supervisors stopped appropriating money for public schools, which remained closed for five years, from 1959 to 1964.\\r\\nWhite students in the county were given assistance to attend white-only \\"private academies\\" that were taught by teachers formerly employed by the public school system, while black students had no education at all unless they moved out of the county. But the public schools reopened after the Supreme Court overturned \\"Brown II\\" in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, declaring that \\"...the time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run out,\\" and that the county must provide a public school system for all children regardless of race.[82]\\r\\nIn 1978, Topeka attorneys Richard Jones, Joseph Johnson and Charles Scott, Jr. (son of the original Brown team member), with assistance from the American Civil Liberties Union, persuaded Linda Brown Smithwho now had her own children in Topeka schoolsto be a plaintiff in reopening Brown. They were concerned that the Topeka Public Schools' policy of \\"open enrollment\\" had led to and would lead to further segregation. They also believed that with a choice of open enrollment, white parents would shift their children to \\"preferred\\" schools that would create both predominantly African American and predominantly European American schools within the district. The district court reopened the Brown case after a 25-year hiatus, but denied the plaintiffs' request finding the schools \\"unitary\\". In 1989, a three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit on 2ÿ1 vote found that the vestiges of segregation remained with respect to student and staff assignment.[83] In 1993, the Supreme Court denied the appellant School District's request for certiorari and returned the case to District Court Judge Richard Rodgers for implementation of the Tenth Circuit's mandate.\\r\\nAfter a 1994 plan was approved and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were opened and district attendance plans redrawn, which resulted in the Topeka schools meeting court standards of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to Topeka Unified School District No. 501 on July 27, 1999.[84] One of the new magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their role in the Brown case and civil rights.[85]\\r\\nLinda Brown Thompson later recalled the experience of being refused enrollment:[86]\\r\\n...we lived in an integrated neighborhood and I had all of these playmates of different nationalities. And so when I found out that day that I might be able to go to their school, I was just thrilled, you know. And I remember walking over to Sumner school with my dad that day and going up the steps of the school and the school looked so big to a smaller child. And I remember going inside and my dad spoke with someone and then he went into the inner office with the principal and they left me out ... to sit outside with the secretary. And while he was in the inner office, I could hear voices and hear his voice raised, you know, as the conversation went on. And then he immediately came out of the office, took me by the hand and we walked home from the school. I just couldn't understand what was happening because I was so sure that I was going to go to school with Mona and Guinevere, Wanda, and all of my playmates.[87]\\r\\nLinda Brown died on March 25, 2018 at the age of 76.[88]\\r\\nI thought Plessy had been wrongly decided at the time, that it was not a good interpretation of the equal protection clause to say that when you segregate people by race, there is no denial of equal protection. But Plessy had been on the books for 60 years; Congress had never acted, and the same Congress that had promulgated the 14th Amendment had required segregation in the District schools.?.?.?. I saw factors on both sides.?.?.?. I did not agree then, and I certainly do not agree now, with the statement that Plessy against Ferguson is right and should be reaffirmed. I had ideas on both sides, and I do not think I ever really finally settled in my own mind on that.?.?.?. [A]round the lunch table I am sure I defended it.?.?.?. I thought there were good arguments to be made in support of it.","input":"Where did brown v board of education happen?"},{"output":"Sachin Tendulkar","context":"One Day International (ODI) cricket is played between international cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC) as well as the top six Associate and Affiliate members.[1] Unlike Test matches, ODIs consist of one innings per team, having a limit in the number of overs. The limit of overs is currently 50 overs per innings, although in the past this has been 55 or 60 overs.[2] ODI cricket is List-A cricket, so statistics and records set in ODI matches also count toward List-A records. The earliest match now recognised as an ODI was played between England and Australia in January 1971;[3] since then there have been over 3,000 ODIs played by 26 teams. The frequency of matches has steadily increased, partly because of the increase in the number of ODI-playing countries, and partly as the cricket boards of those nations seek to maximise their revenue and also due to increase of popularity of Cricket.[4]\\r\\nThe most successful team in ODI cricket, in terms of win percentage, barring the Asia XI cricket team,[5] is Australia, having won 556 of their 911 ODIs (63.91%). Out of whole nations, its South Africa which dethroned Australia in terms of highest win percentage in ODIs in the year 2017 and currently hold record for having 64.08 (teams with more than 500 ODIs to their name).[6] In contrast, four teams have failed to win a single ODI: East Africa, Hong Kong, Namibia, and the USA.[7] Notable ODI records include longest winning sequence (Australia, 21), longest losing sequence (Bangladesh, 23), highest match by any player (Sachin,463 ) highest individual score (Rohit Sharma, 264), best bowling figures (Chaminda Vaas, 8ÿ19), most runs in an over (Herschelle Gibbs, 36) and fastest century (AB De Villiers, 31 deliveries[8]).\\r\\nThe trend of countries to increase the number of ODI matches they play means that the aggregate lists are dominated by modern players.

Players attempt to make melds of seven cards of the same rank and \\"go out\\" by playing all cards in their hand. It is the only partnership member of the family of Rummy games to achieve the status of a classic.\\r\\nThe game of Canasta was devised by Segundo Santos and Alberto Serrato in Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1939.[6] In the 1940s the game quickly spread in myriad variations to Chile, Peru, Brazil and Argentina,[6] where its rules were further refined[7] before being introduced to the United States in 1948, where it was then referred to as the Argentine Rummy game by Ottilie H. Reilly in 1949 and Michael Scully of Coronet magazine in 1953.[8] The game quickly became a card-craze boom in the 1950s[9] providing a sales avalanche of card sets, card trays and books about the subject.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe classic game is for four players in two partnerships. Variations exist for two and three player games wherein each plays alone, and also for a six player game in two partnerships of three. If partners are chosen they must sit opposite each other. Canasta uses two complete decks of 52 playing cards (French Deck) plus the four Jokers. All the Jokers and twos are wild cards.\\r\\nThe initial dealer is chosen by any common method, although it should be remembered that in Canasta there is no privilege or advantage to being the dealer. The deal then rotates clockwise after every hand. The dealer shuffles the pack, the player to the dealer's right cuts, and the dealer deals out a hand of 11 cards to each player.\\r\\nThe remaining cards are left in a stack in the center of the table.\\r\\nThe player to the dealer's left has the first turn, and play then proceeds clockwise. A turn begins either by drawing the first card from the stock into the player's hand or by picking up the entire discard pile. However, there are restrictions on when one can pick up the discard pile. (See Picking up the discard pile, below.) If the card drawn from the stock is a red three the player must table it immediately, as one would if melding, and draw another card.\\r\\nThe player may then make as many legal melds as they wish from the cards in their hand. A turn ends when the player discards one card from their hand to the top of the discard pile. No player may \\"undo\\" a meld or laid card, or change their mind after drawing a card from the deck if they decide that they could have taken the discard pile.\\r\\nEach player/team keeps separate melds of the various ranks of cards. A player may never play to an opponent's meld. A legal meld consists of at least three cards of the same rank. Suits are irrelevant except that black threes are treated differently from red threes. Wild cards can be used as any rank except for threes. Threes may never be melded in ordinary play, although 3 or 4 black threes may be melded last in the process of a player going out.\\r\\nA meld must consist of at least two natural cards, and can never have more wild cards than natural cards (and therefore more than three wild cards). Examples: 5-5-2 and 9-9-9-2-2-Joker are legal melds. 5-2-2 is not a legal meld as it contains only one natural card. 9-9-2-2-2-Joker is not legal as it contains more wild cards than natural cards.\\r\\nA canasta is a meld of at least seven cards, whether natural or mixed. A natural canasta is one that comprises only cards of the same rank. A mixed canasta (or dirty canasta) is one that comprises both natural and wild cards.\\r\\nA \\"concealed\\" canasta is a canasta assembled in the player's hand and is played to the table complete, or requiring only the top card from the discard pile (the discard pile being picked up in the usual way). A concealed canasta may be natural or mixed and carries a bonus score of 100 points (so 400 for a concealed mixed canasta and 600 for a concealed natural canasta).\\r\\nAt the beginning of a game, both teams have an initial meld requirement of 50. When a player/team has not yet made any melds in a hand, that player must meet an additional point score requirement to make their first meld(s). The sum of the values of the cards played in the player's turn must equal or exceed the minimum initial meld requirement according to the player/team's total score:\\r\\nExample: If a player/team has a score of 1,600 and has not yet made any melds in a hand, an initial meld of 6-6-6, K-K-K-2 cannot be made as it scores only 65 points and the requirement is 90. A meld of 6-6-6, A-A-A-2 would score 95 points and can be played. Note that both initial melds can be played if the team's total score is below 1500, and that neither can be played if the team's total score is 3000 or higher.\\r\\nAt the beginning of their turn, a player may pick up the entire discard pile instead of drawing a card from the stock. They may only pick up the discard pile if they can use the top card, either in an existing meld or by making a new meld along with at least two other cards from their hand. Only the top card is relevant for the player/team to pick up the rest of the discard pile. In addition, if the play/team has not yet melded, they must meet the initial meld requirement using the top card of the discard pile in order to pick up the pile.\\r\\nIf a wild card has previously been discarded to the pile, the discard pile is frozen. When the discard pile is frozen, it may only be thawed (picked up) if the player can meld the top card with two natural cards of the same rank in the player's hand. The discard pile is also frozen for a player/team that has not yet melded at all this hand; though it will not be frozen for another player/team that has melded.\\r\\nIf a wild card or a black three is on top of the discard pile, it may not be picked up. Playing a black three does not freeze the pile, however; it just acts as a \\"stop card\\". The card discarded after a black three allows the pile to be picked up again (unless it is a wild card or another black three).\\r\\nA player may go out by using all the cards in their hand only if that player/team has made one or more canastas. The player may go out only by melding all his cards, and may discard a single final card if necessary. It is not required to discard a card in the process of legally going out. If the player/team has not yet made any canastas, players in that team may not make a play which would leave them with no cards in their hand at the end of their turn. The hand ends immediately when any player goes out.\\r\\nWhen considering going out, a player may ask their partner for permission to go out; however, it is not required to ask partner's permission, but if done the player must abide by the partner's answer. If the partner refuses permission, the player may not go out this turn. If the partner responds \\"yes\\", the player must go out this turn.\\r\\nIf a player can legally go out, but has three or more black threes in his hand, these may be melded at this time only.\\r\\nAt the end of each hand, the score for each team is calculated as follows:\\r\\nThe total value of all cards melded by that player/team, including cards in canastas minus the total value of all cards remaining in the team's hands, plus any bonuses:\\r\\nIf a partnership has accumulated red threes, but has not yet made any melds when the opposition team goes out, then the total value of all the cards left in the player/team's hand(s) as well as the bonus value of melded red threes are subtracted from that team's previous score. That is, if a team has three red threes but had not yet made any melds, at the end of that hand the team will suffer a penalty of 300 points rather than gaining a 300-point bonus.\\r\\nThe game ends when a player/team's total score reaches 5,000 or above. The team with the highest total score at this point wins.\\r\\nCanasta can be played with fewer than four players with some variations in the rules. The most significant changes are in the number of cards dealt at the beginning of the hand and the fact that each person plays individually. In a game with three players, each player receives 13 cards. In a two player game each player receives 15 cards and each player draws two cards on each of their turns and discards one. If each player draws two cards, there is usually the additional requirement that a player must have made two canastas in order to go out.\\r\\nThis version of Canasta is widespread, especially in the United States, and it was the official tournament version used by the (possibly defunct) American Canasta Association. American Canasta can be found in few books. One notable exception is Scarne's Encyclopedia of Card Games, where the author claims to have invented a game which he calls International Canasta. Most of the elements of Modern American Canasta can be found in Scarne's International Canasta, although there are some differences.\\r\\nWinning Moves Games USA first published Canasta Caliente in 1999 and still markets the game in the USA.\\r\\nDue to its relative complexity and unforgiving scoring rules, which give large penalties for many melds that would be acceptable and even good in other versions, this may not be the best version for beginning players; \\"classic\\" canasta or Hand & Foot may better serve this purpose. (On the other hand, these versions can teach habits that become major liabilities in American canasta.) This version is only meant to be played by exactly four players, in two two-person partnerships. Important differences between this version and the \\"classic\\" version include:\\r\\nSamba is a variant of Canasta, played with three decks, including jokers, for a total of 162 cards. 15 cards are dealt to each of four players, and an additional card is turned up. The game is to 10,000 points instead of 5,000. Samba allows sequence melds of three or more (for example, the 4, 5, and 6 of hearts or the Queen, King and Ace of Spades). If a player is able to make a sequence of seven (for example, the 5 through J of diamonds), this is a samba and is worth 1,500 points. Rather than four red threes being worth 800 points, six red threes are worth 1,000 points. Two wild cards is the maximum allowed for a meld. The minimum initial meld is 150 if a partnership has 7,000 or more.\\r\\nBolivian Canasta is similar to Samba, as it uses three decks and sequence melds.[11] Play is to 15,000. Wild card canastas (bolivias) count 2,500. A side must have a samba (called escalera in this game) and at least one other canasta to go out. Red threes only count positive if two or more canastas have been melded. Black threes are negative 100 instead of negative 5 when left in hand.\\r\\nSimilar to Bolivia, but only to 10,000. The minimum meld requirements are 150 from 5,000 to 7,000; a canasta from 7,000 to 8,000; 200 from 8,000 to 9,000; and a natural canasta from 9,000 up. Wild card canastas count 2,000. Partnerships receive 1,000 for five red threes and 1,200 for all six. If a side has a sequence of five cards or less, it loses 1,000.\\r\\nSimilar to the original rules but with the important addition of 'Acaba' (Spanish for 'The End'). A player may say this at any point during their turn and will immediately forfeit the round awarding the opposing player or team 1,500 points and receiving 0 points, ending the very dull phase where one player or team has total control over the discard deck. When playing in teams a player may ask their teammate for permission to say acaba just as they may ask before going out and they will also be bound by the response in the same way.[12] [13]\\r\\nAllows both sambas and bolivias. Can be played with either three decks (162 cards) or four decks (216 cards)\\r\\nA two-deck variant to 7,500. Requires 150 for an initial meld if a partnership is over 5,000. The deck is always frozen. Wild card canastas are worth between 2,000 and 4,000; depending on the number of deuces. Threes are scored only if canastas are made; they count 100 for one, 300 for two, 500 for three and 1,000 for four. Black threes are removed from play if a discard pile is taken; a partnership that removes all four black threes this way gets 100 points.\\r\\nItalian canasta is a Samba variant. The number of cards in the discard pile at the beginning of the game varies with the initial card turned up. The discard pile is always frozen. Deuces may, but a partnership may not play deuces as wild cards if deuces have been melded and a canasta is incomplete. Game is to 15,000\\r\\nThis is regular canasta with two variants:\\r\\nThis variation originates in Slovakia. Since the definition of Canasta rules differed from player to player a strong urge has risen for unified rules. This in turn was satisfied by the creation of Boat Canasta, which really is a mix of other known rules, but thoroughly optimized. Currently this variant of Canasta is steadily gaining popularity mainly in Slovakia, but also in countries such as France, Germany and England.\\r\\nThis version is a quad deck game that is played with a hand and a foot, unlike traditional canasta that just has a hand. Hand and Foot is a Canasta variant involving four to seven decks and is played by teams of two players (usually two teams, but it also works with three or four teams). The number of decks used is typically one more than the number of players, though this can vary. Due to the larger pool of available cards, it is much easier to form canastas in Hand and Foot than in standard Canasta, which changes the strategy considerably. Some players feel this version is more enjoyable for beginners. The variant was born in the 1970s; commercial decks to play Hand and Foot have been available since 1987. Important rule changes for this variant include:\\r\\nAt the beginning of a game, both teams have an initial meld requirement of 50. The requirement increases in value in subsequent hands.\\r\\nAt the end of each hand, the score for each team is calculated as follows:\\r\\nThe total value of all cards melded by that player/team, including cards in canastas minus the total value of all cards remaining in the team's hands, plus any bonuses:\\r\\nPoint values are:\\r\\nThe expression \\"as dead as Canasta\\" cites the transience of popular interest in the game within the United States.\\r\\nIn the J. D. Salinger novel The Catcher in the Rye, protagonist Holden Caulfield says of fellow student Ackley, \\"'Listen,' I said, 'do you feel like playing a little Canasta?' He was a Canasta fiend.\\"","input":"How many players do you need to play canasta?"},{"output":"1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan","context":"Snowboarding is a sport at the Winter Olympic Games. It was first included in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.[1] Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic program between 1992 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event.[2] In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other.[2] Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding.[3] Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association.[4] For the 2002 Winter Olympics, giant slalom was expanded to add head-to-head racing and was renamed parallel giant slalom.[5] In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.[6] On July 11, 2011, the International Olympic Committee's Executive Board approved the addition of Ski and Snowboard Slopestyle to the Winter Olympics roster of events, effective in 2014. The decision was announced via press conference from the IOC's meeting in Durban, South Africa. A fifth event, parallel slalom, was added only for 2014. Big air was added for 2018.\\r\\nSix athletes have won at least two medals. Shaun White of the United States is the only triple gold medalist. Philipp Schoch of Switzerland and Seth Wescott of the United States are the only double gold medalists.[7][8] Karine Ruby of France and Americans Ross Powers and Danny Kass also won two medals.[9] In the men's half-pipe event, American snowboarders have collected six of nine possible medals, achieving a unique medal sweep in 2002.[10] The United States won a total of 24 medals, more than any other nation. The Americans and the Swiss collected ten and seven gold medals respectively.

In human populations, the generation time typically ranges from 22 to 32 years.[1] Historians sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe existing definitions of the generation time fall into two categories: those that treat the generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions:[2][3]\\r\\nThe net reproductive rate R0 is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in microbiology (\\"the time it takes for the population to double\\", or doubling time) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a bacterium is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate r (i.e. n(t) ~ ϫ.ert, where n(t) is the size of the population at time t), then this measure of the generation time is given by:\\r\\nIndeed, \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle T}\\r\\n\\r\\n is such that n(t + T) = R0 n(t), i.e. erT = R0.\\r\\nThis definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the \\"average age of mothers at birth of their daughters\\"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age-structured population models, an expression is given by:[2][3]\\r\\nwhere r is the growth rate of the population, ?(x) is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age x) and m(x) the maternity function (or birth function, or age-specific fertility). For matrix population models, there is a general formula:[4]\\r\\nwhere  = er is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, F = (fij) is its fertility matrix, v its reproductive value (row-vector) and w its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ne\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n)\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nf\\r\\n\\r\\ni\\r\\nj\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\textstyle e_{\\\\lambda }(f_{ij})={\\\\frac {f_{ij}}{\\\\lambda }}{\\\\frac {\\\\partial \\\\lambda }{\\\\partial f_{ij}}}}\\r\\n\\r\\n are the elasticities of  to the fertilities.\\r\\nThis definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by:[2][3]\\r\\nIndeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is R0, the average number of offspring it produces.","input":"How long is a human generation in years?"},{"output":"constitutional monarchy","context":"Her Majesty's Government, commonly referred to as the UK government or British government, is the central government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.[3][4]\\r\\nThe government is led by the Prime Minister, who selects all the remaining ministers. The prime minister and the other most senior ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the Cabinet.[4] The government ministers all sit in Parliament, and are accountable to it. The government is dependent on Parliament to make primary legislation,[5] and since the Fixed-terms Parliaments Act 2011, general elections are held every five years to elect a new House of Commons, unless there is a successful vote of no confidence in the government or a two-thirds vote for a snap election (as was the case in 2017) in the House of Commons, in which case an election may be held sooner. After an election, the monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II) selects as prime minister the leader of the party most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons, usually by possessing a majority of MPs.[6]\\r\\nUnder the uncodified British constitution, executive authority lies with the monarch, although this authority is exercised only by, or on the advice of, the prime minister and the cabinet.[7] The Cabinet members advise the monarch as members of the Privy Council. They also exercise power directly as leaders of the Government Departments.\\r\\nThe current prime minister is Theresa May, who took office on 13 July 2016. She is the leader of the Conservative Party, which won a majority of seats in the House of Commons in the general election on 7 May 2015, when David Cameron was the party leader; although at the last general election she failed to secure a majority government. Prior to this, Cameron and the Conservatives led a coalition from 2010 to 2015 with the Liberal Democrats, in which Cameron was prime minister.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA key principle of the British Constitution is that the government is responsible to Parliament. This is called responsible government.\\r\\nThe United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy in which the reigning monarch (that is, the King or Queen who is the Head of State at any given time) does not make any open political decisions. All political decisions are taken by the government and Parliament. This constitutional state of affairs is the result of a long history of constraining and reducing the political power of the monarch, beginning with the Magna Carta in 1215.\\r\\nParliament is split into two houses: the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Commons is the lower house and is the more powerful. The House of Lords is the upper house and although it can vote to amend proposed laws, the House of Commons can usually vote to overrule its amendments. Although the House of Lords can introduce bills, most important laws are introduced in the House of Commons ÿ and most of those are introduced by the government, which schedules the vast majority of parliamentary time in the Commons. Parliamentary time is essential for bills to be passed into law, because they must pass through a number of readings before becoming law. Prior to introducing a bill, the government may run a public consultation to solicit feedback from the public and businesses, and often may have already introduced and discussed the policy in the Queen's Speech, or in an election manifesto or party platform.\\r\\nMinisters of the Crown are responsible to the House in which they sit; they make statements in that House and take questions from members of that House. For most senior ministers this is usually the elected House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. There have been some recent exceptions to this: for example, cabinet ministers Lord Mandelson (First Secretary of State) and Lord Adonis (Secretary of State for Transport) sat in the Lords and were responsible to that House during the government of Gordon Brown.\\r\\nSince the start of Edward VII's reign in 1901, the prime minister has always been an elected member of Parliament (MP) and therefore directly accountable to the House of Commons. A similar convention applies to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It would likely be politically unacceptable for the budget speech to be given in the Lords, with MPs unable to directly question the Chancellor, especially now that the Lords have very limited powers in relation to money bills. The last Chancellor of the Exchequer to be a member of the House of Lords was Lord Denman, who served as interim Chancellor of the Exchequer for one month in 1834.[8]\\r\\nUnder the British system, the government is required by convention and for practical reasons to maintain the confidence of the House of Commons. It requires the support of the House of Commons for the maintenance of supply (by voting through the government's budgets) and to pass primary legislation. By convention, if a government loses the confidence of the House of Commons it must either resign or a General Election is held. The support of the Lords, while useful to the government in getting its legislation passed without delay, is not vital. A government is not required to resign even if it loses the confidence of the Lords and is defeated in key votes in that House. The House of Commons is thus the Responsible house.\\r\\nThe prime minister is held to account during Prime Minister's Question Time (PMQs) which provides an opportunity for MPs from all parties to question the PM on any subject. There are also departmental questions when ministers answer questions relating to their specific departmental brief. Unlike PMQs both the cabinet ministers for the department and junior ministers within the department may answer on behalf of the government, depending on the topic of the question.\\r\\nDuring debates on legislation proposed by the government, ministersusually with departmental responsibility for the billwill lead the debate for the government and respond to points made by MPs or Lords.\\r\\nCommittees[9] of both the House of Commons and House of Lords hold the government to account, scrutinise its work and examine in detail proposals for legislation. Ministers appear before committees to give evidence and answer questions.\\r\\nGovernment ministers are also required by convention and the Ministerial Code,[10] when Parliament is sitting, to make major statements regarding government policy or issues of national importance to Parliament. This allows MPs or Lords to question the government on the statement. When the government instead chooses to make announcements first outside Parliament, it is often the subject of significant criticism from MPs and the Speaker of the House of Commons.[11]\\r\\nThe British monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state and the sovereign, but not the head of government.\\r\\nThe monarch takes little direct part in governing the country, and remains neutral in political affairs. However, the legal authority of the state that is vested in the sovereign, known as The Crown, remains the source of the executive power exercised by the government.\\r\\nIn addition to explicit statutory authority, in many areas the Crown also possesses a body of powers known as the Royal Prerogative, which can be used for many purposes, from the issue or withdrawal of passports to declaration of war. By long-standing custom, most of these powers are delegated from the sovereign to various ministers or other officers of the Crown, who may use them without having to obtain the consent of Parliament.\\r\\nThe head of the government, the prime minister, also has weekly meetings with the monarch, when she \\"has a right and a duty to express her views on Government matters...These meetings, as with all communications between The Queen and her Government, remain strictly confidential. Having expressed her views, The Queen abides by the advice of her ministers.\\"[12]\\r\\nRoyal Prerogative powers include, but are not limited to, the following:\\r\\nEven though the United Kingdom has no single constitutional document, the government published the above list in October 2003 to increase transparency, as some of the powers exercised in the name of the monarch are part of the Royal Prerogative.[13] However, the complete extent of the Royal Prerogative powers has never been fully set out, as many of them originated in ancient custom and the period of absolute monarchy, or were modified by later constitutional practice,\\r\\nGovernment ministers are supported by 560,000[14] Civil Servants and other staff working in the 24 Ministerial Departments[15] and their executive agencies. There are also an additional 26 non-Ministerial Departments with a range of further responsibilities.\\r\\nThe prime minister is based at 10 Downing Street in Westminster, London. Cabinet meetings also take place here. Most government departments have their headquarters nearby in Whitehall.\\r\\nSince 1999, certain areas of central government have been devolved to accountable governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These are not part of Her Majesty's Government, and are accountable to their own institutions, with their own authority under the Crown. By contrast, there is no devolved government in England.\\r\\nUp to three layers of elected local authorities (such as County, District and Parish Councils) exist throughout all parts of the United Kingdom, in some places merged into Unitary Authorities. They have limited local tax-raising powers. Many other authorities and agencies also have statutory powers, generally subject to some central government supervision.\\r\\nThe government's powers include general executive and statutory powers, delegated legislation, and numerous powers of appointment and patronage. However, some powerful officials and bodies, (e.g. HM judges, local authorities, and the Charity Commissions) are legally more or less independent of the government, and government powers are legally limited to those retained by the Crown under Common Law or granted and limited by Act of Parliament, and are subject to European Union law and the competencies that it defines. Both substantive and procedural limitations are enforceable in the Courts by judicial review.\\r\\nNevertheless, magistrates and mayors can still be arrested for and put on trial for corruption, and the government has powers to insert commissioners into a local authority to oversee its work, and to issue directives that must be obeyed by the local authority, if the local authority is not abiding by its statutory obligations.[16]\\r\\nBy contrast, as in every other European Union (EU) member state, EU officials cannot be prosecuted for any actions carried out in pursuit of their official duties, and foreign country diplomats (though not their employees) and foreign Members of the European Parliament[17] are immune from prosecution in the UK under any circumstance. As a consequence, neither EU bodies nor diplomats have to pay taxes, since it would not be possible to prosecute them for tax evasion. This caused a dispute in recent years when the US Ambassador to the UK claimed that London's congestion charge was a tax, and not a charge (despite the name), and therefore he did not have to pay it ÿ a claim the Greater London Authority disputed.\\r\\nSimilarly, the monarch is totally immune from criminal prosecution and may only be sued with her permission (this is known as sovereign immunity). The monarch, by law, is not required to pay income tax, but Queen Elizabeth II has voluntarily paid it since 1993, and also pays local rates voluntarily. However, the monarchy also receives a substantial grant from the government, the Sovereign Support Grant, and Queen Elizabeth II's inheritance from her mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, was exempt from inheritance tax.\\r\\nIn addition to legislative powers, HM Government has substantial influence over local authorities and other bodies set up by it, by financial powers and grants. Many functions carried out by local authorities, such as paying out housing benefit and council tax benefit, are funded or substantially part-funded by central government.\\r\\nEven though the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is supposed to be independent of the government on a day-to-day level and is supposed to be politically unbiased, some commentators have argued that the prospects of the BBC having its funding cut or its charter changed in future charter renewals in practice cause the BBC to be subtly biased towards the government of the day (or the likely future government as an election approaches) at times.\\r\\nNeither the central government nor local authorities are permitted to sue anyone for defamation. Individual politicians are allowed to sue people for defamation in a personal capacity and without using government funds, but this is relatively rare (although George Galloway, who was a backbench MP for a quarter of a century, has sued or threatened to sue for defamation a number of times). However, it is a criminal offence to make a false statement about any election candidate during an election, with the purpose of reducing the number of votes they receive (as with libel, opinions do not count).","input":"What type of government does united kingdom have?"},{"output":"The col܇n","context":"The col܇n (named after Christopher Columbus, known as Crist܇bal Col܇n in Spanish) is the currency of Costa Rica.

In 1923, silver 25 and 50 centimos from the peso currency, along with the unissued 50 centavos from 1917 and 1918, were issued with counterstamps which doubled their values to 50 centimos and 1 col܇n.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1925, silver 25 centimo coins were introduced. The last government issued coins were brass 10 centimos issued between 1936 and 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1935, the International Bank of Costa Rica issued cupro-nickel coins in denominations of 25 and 50 centimos and 1 col܇n. These bore the initials B.I.C.R.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the National Bank introduced coins in denominations of 25 and 50 centimos and 1 col܇n which bore the initials B.N.C.R. These were followed by 5 and 10 centimos in 1942 and 2 colones in 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1951, the Central Bank took over coin issuance using the initials B.C.C.R. while introducing 5 and 10 centimo coins. These were followed by 1 and 2 colones in 1954, 50 centimos in 1965 and 25 centimos in 1967. In 1982ÿ1983, 5 and 10 centimo coins were discontinued, the sizes of the 25 centimo to 2 col܇n coins were reduced and 5, 10 and 20 col܇n coins were introduced. Between 1995 & 1998, smaller, brass 1, 5 and 10 col܇n coins were introduced and coins for 25, 50 & 100 colones were added. 500 colones followed in 2003. Aluminium 5 and 10 colones were introduced in 2006. Coins of 1 col܇n are no longer found in circulation. In 2009 the larger, silver-coloured  ?5,  ?10 &  ?20 were gradually withdrawn leaving the small, lighter,  ?5 and ?10 and the gold-coloured  ?5,  ?10,  ?25,  ?50,  ?100 &  ?500 coins circulating.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour private banks, the Banco AngloÿCostarricense, the Banco Comercial de Costa Rica, the Banco de Costa Rica and the Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica, issued notes between 1864 and 1917.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banco AngloÿCostarricense was established in 1864 and issued notes from 1864 to 1917. It later became a state-owned bank and in 1994 went bankrupt and closed. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 25, 50, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 colones. Some 1, 5, 10 and 20 colones notes (unsigned and undated) were released in 1963 when the bank celebrated its 100th anniversary. Some had Muestra sin Valor (\\"sample without value\\") printed on them in order to nullify the legal tender status and to prevent people from selling them. Most, however, didn't have that printed on them, which makes it harder nowadays to find notes with the seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banco de Costa Rica was established in 1890 and issued notes from 1890 to 1914. It is currently a state-owned bank. Notes were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 100 pesos as well as 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banco Comercial de Costa Rica issued notes between 1906 and 1914 in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The Banco Mercantil de Costa Rica issued notes between 1910 and 1916, also in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government issued gold certificates in 1897 for 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 colones. Between 1902 and 1917, it issued silver certificates for 50 centimos, 1, 2, 50 and 100 colones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914, the Banco Internacional de Costa Rica introduced notes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones, to which 25 and 50 centimos, 1 and 2 colones were added in 1918. Although 25 centimos were not issued after 1919, the other denominations continued to be issued until 1936. After 1917, the Banco Internacional's notes were the only issued for circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1937, the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica took over paper money issuing and issued notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones until 1949. Many of the early notes were provisional issues overprinted on notes of the Banco Internacional, including the 1 col܇n notes which were briefly issued.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Banco Central de Costa Rica began issuing paper money in 1950, with notes for 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 colones. The first notes were provisional issues produced from Banco Nacional notes (unsigned and undated). The Central Bank printed on them the corresponding signatures and dates, and the legend \\"BANCO CENTRAL DE COSTA RICA\\" over \\"BANCO NACIONAL DE COSTA RICA\\". Regular issues of notes began in 1951, but a second provisional issue of 2 colones notes was made in 1967. 1,000 colones notes were added in 1958, followed by 500 colones in 1973, 5,000 colones in 1992, and 2,000 and 10,000 colones in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever a banknote of a specific denomination is changed (design, security features, colour, etc.), a new series is released. Every banknote issued by this bank measures approximately 6.6?cm x 15.5?cm. Every note also has the serial and series numbers printed in red ink. Exceptions occurred with:\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery issue also features the signatures, date, and the agreement number printed in black.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2012, Costa Rican banknotes are undergoing a reform and are being replaced by a new model. Two new denominations were introduced as part of the reform; 20,000 and 50,000 colones.[2] The old notes will all be withdrawn from circulation and be replaced by new ones. The new banknotes will have different colors, shapes and images from their predecessors. All the denominations have a different length so that people with visual impairments can recognize the banknotes easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe col܇n has had an unusual relationship with the U.S. dollar that may best be described as a \\"crawling peg\\"; instead of being defined by a constant value to the dollar, the col܇n instead would grow progressively weaker at a fixed rate of about 3.294 colones per dollar per month. On October 16, 2006, however, this crawling peg was modified[3] due to weakness in the U.S. dollar and the perception that the col܇n is now undervalued.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince October 17, 2006, the col܇n is no longer bound to controlled devaluations (known in Costa Rica as minidevaluaciones) by the Central Bank of Costa Rica. With the new system, sistema cambiario de bandas, the exchange rates posted by the Central Bank are a \\"reference\\" and each authorized financial institution can determine their value independently in hopes that the free market will provide a mechanism to keep them reasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exchange rate is now free to float within a currency band referenced to the United States dollar.  The floor of the band has been set at a fixed value, while the ceiling changes at a fixed rate.  In practice the exchange rate has remained fixed at the lower value of the currency band.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe col܇n is sometimes referred to as the peso, which was the name of the Costa Rican currency before the col܇n, until 1896. This is very common across Latin American countries, where most have (or had at some point) currencies called pesos. Another slang name is ca?a (Spanish for sugar cane, plural ca?as) but this term is more often used in its plural form and for amounts under 100 colones with multiples of ten, except for 5; e.g., 5 ca?as, 10 ca?as, 20 ca?as, etc. This term has become less common.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeja (roof tile) is the slang term for one hundred colones, so that five hundred colones coins and notes are called \\"cinco tejas\\", while fifty colones coins and notes are referred to as \\"media teja\\" (half roof tile).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former five hundred colones note was called \\"morado\\" (purple) because of its colour, but it is no longer in circulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one thousand colones note is called \\"un rojo\\" (one red) because of its colour. This also applies for any amounts that are multiples of a thousand colones (e.g., twenty thousand colones = veinte rojos).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe five thousand colones note is called tucn (toucan), referring to the image of a toucan it once carried (it now features a monkey). It can also be called \\"una libra\\" (one pound), although this term is no longer in common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ten thousand colones note is also known as un puma, referring to the puma shown on one of its faces.","input":"What is the current currency in costa rica?"},{"output":"August 17, 2018","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSweetener is the fourth studio album by American singer Ariana Grande.

The moment of extinction is generally considered to be the death of the last individual of the species, although the capacity to breed and recover may have been lost before this point. Because a species' potential range may be very large, determining this moment is difficult, and is usually done retrospectively. This difficulty leads to phenomena such as Lazarus taxa, where a species presumed extinct abruptly \\"reappears\\" (typically in the fossil record) after a period of apparent absence.\\r\\nMore than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,[1] that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.[2][3][4] Estimates on the number of Earth's current species range from 10 million to 14 million,[5] of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described.[6] More recently, in May 2016, scientists reported that 1 trillion species are estimated to be on Earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described.[7]\\r\\nThrough evolution, species arise through the process of speciationwhere new varieties of organisms arise and thrive when they are able to find and exploit an ecological nicheand species become extinct when they are no longer able to survive in changing conditions or against superior competition. The relationship between animals and their ecological niches has been firmly established.[8] A typical species becomes extinct within 10 million years of its first appearance,[4] although some species, called living fossils, survive with virtually no morphological change for hundreds of millions of years.\\r\\nMass extinctions are relatively rare events; however, isolated extinctions are quite common. Only recently have extinctions been recorded and scientists have become alarmed at the current high rate of extinctions.[9][10][11][12] Most species that become extinct are never scientifically documented. Some scientists estimate that up to half of presently existing plant and animal species may become extinct by 2100.[13]\\r\\nA dagger symbol (?) placed next to the name of a species or other taxon is often done to indicate its status as extinct.\\r\\nA species is extinct when the last existing member dies. Extinction therefore becomes a certainty when there are no surviving individuals that can reproduce and create a new generation. A species may become functionally extinct when only a handful of individuals survive, which cannot reproduce due to poor health, age, sparse distribution over a large range, a lack of individuals of both sexes (in sexually reproducing species), or other reasons.\\r\\nPinpointing the extinction (or pseudoextinction) of a species requires a clear definition of that species. If it is to be declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor or daughter species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) plays a key role in the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.[15]\\r\\nIn ecology, extinction is often used informally to refer to local extinction, in which a species ceases to exist in the chosen area of study, but may still exist elsewhere. This phenomenon is also known as extirpation. Local extinctions may be followed by a replacement of the species taken from other locations; wolf reintroduction is an example of this. Species which are not extinct are termed extant. Those that are extant but threatened by extinction are referred to as threatened or endangered species.\\r\\nCurrently an important aspect of extinction is human attempts to preserve critically endangered species. These are reflected by the creation of the conservation status \\"extinct in the wild\\" (EW). Species listed under this status by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) are not known to have any living specimens in the wild, and are maintained only in zoos or other artificial environments. Some of these species are functionally extinct, as they are no longer part of their natural habitat and it is unlikely the species will ever be restored to the wild.[17] When possible, modern zoological institutions try to maintain a viable population for species preservation and possible future reintroduction to the wild, through use of carefully planned breeding programs.\\r\\nThe extinction of one species' wild population can have knock-on effects, causing further extinctions. These are also called \\"chains of extinction\\".[18] This is especially common with extinction of keystone species.\\r\\nExtinction of a parent species where daughter species or subspecies are still extant is called pseudoextinction or phyletic extinction. Effectively, the old taxon vanishes, transformed (anagenesis) into a successor,[19] or split into more than one (cladogenesis).[20]\\r\\nPseudoextinction is difficult to demonstrate unless one has a strong chain of evidence linking a living species to members of a pre-existing species. For example, it is sometimes claimed that the extinct Hyracotherium, which was an early horse that shares a common ancestor with the modern horse, is pseudoextinct, rather than extinct, because there are several extant species of Equus, including zebra and donkey. However, as fossil species typically leave no genetic material behind, one cannot say whether Hyracotherium evolved into more modern horse species or merely evolved from a common ancestor with modern horses. Pseudoextinction is much easier to demonstrate for larger taxonomic groups.\\r\\nThe coelacanth, a fish related to lungfish and tetrapods, was considered to have been extinct since the end of the Cretaceous Period until 1938 when a specimen was found, off the Chalumna River (now Tyolomnqa) on the east coast of South Africa.[21] Museum curator Marjorie Courtenay-Latimer discovered the fish among the catch of a local angler, Captain Hendrick Goosen, on December 23, 1938.[21] A local chemistry professor, JLB Smith, confirmed the fish's importance with a famous cable: \\"MOST IMPORTANT PRESERVE SKELETON AND GILLS = FISH DESCRIBED\\".[21]\\r\\nFar more recent possible or presumed extinctions of species which may turn out still to exist include the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger (Thylacinus cynocephalus), the last known example of which died in Hobart Zoo in Tasmania in 1936; the Japanese wolf (Canis lupus hodophilax), last sighted over 100 years ago; the ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis), last sighted for certain in 1944; and the slender-billed curlew (Numenius tenuirostris), not seen since 2007.[22]\\r\\nAs long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct. It is estimated that over 99.9% of all species that ever lived are extinct. The average lifespan of a species is 1ÿ10 million years,[23] although this varies widely between taxa. There are a variety of causes that can contribute directly or indirectly to the extinction of a species or group of species. \\"Just as each species is unique\\", write Beverly and Stephen C. Stearns, \\"so is each extinction?... the causes for each are variedsome subtle and complex, others obvious and simple\\".[24] Most simply, any species that cannot survive and reproduce in its environment and cannot move to a new environment where it can do so, dies out and becomes extinct. Extinction of a species may come suddenly when an otherwise healthy species is wiped out completely, as when toxic pollution renders its entire habitat unliveable; or may occur gradually over thousands or millions of years, such as when a species gradually loses out in competition for food to better adapted competitors. Extinction may occur a long time after the events that set it in motion, a phenomenon known as extinction debt.\\r\\nAssessing the relative importance of genetic factors compared to environmental ones as the causes of extinction has been compared to the debate on nature and nurture.[25] The question of whether more extinctions in the fossil record have been caused by evolution or by catastrophe is a subject of discussion; Mark Newman, the author of Modeling Extinction, argues for a mathematical model that falls between the two positions.[4] By contrast, conservation biology uses the extinction vortex model to classify extinctions by cause. When concerns about human extinction have been raised, for example in Sir Martin Rees' 2003 book Our Final Hour, those concerns lie with the effects of climate change or technological disaster.\\r\\nCurrently, environmental groups and some governments are concerned with the extinction of species caused by humanity, and they try to prevent further extinctions through a variety of conservation programs.[9] Humans can cause extinction of a species through overharvesting, pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species (such as new predators and food competitors), overhunting, and other influences. Explosive, unsustainable human population growth is an essential cause of the extinction crisis.[26] According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), 784 extinctions have been recorded since the year 1500, the arbitrary date selected to define \\"recent\\" extinctions, up to the year 2004; with many more likely to have gone unnoticed. Several species have also been listed as extinct since 2004.[27]\\r\\nIf adaptation increasing population fitness is slower than environmental degradation plus the accumulation of slightly deleterious mutations, then a population will go extinct.[28] Smaller populations have fewer beneficial mutations entering the population each generation, slowing adaptation. It is also easier for slightly deleterious mutations to fix in small populations; the resulting positive feedback loop between small population size and low fitness can cause mutational meltdown.\\r\\nLimited geographic range is the most important determinant of genus extinction at background rates but becomes increasingly irrelevant as mass extinction arises.[29] Limited geographic range is a cause both of small population size and of greater vulnerability to local environmental catastrophes.\\r\\nExtinction rates can be affected not just by population size, but by any factor that affects evolvability, including balancing selection, cryptic genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, and robustness. A diverse or deep gene pool gives a population a higher chance in the short term of surviving an adverse change in conditions. Effects that cause or reward a loss in genetic diversity can increase the chances of extinction of a species. Population bottlenecks can dramatically reduce genetic diversity by severely limiting the number of reproducing individuals and make inbreeding more frequent.\\r\\nPurebred wild species evolved to a specific ecology can be threatened with extinction[30] through the process of genetic pollutioni.e., uncontrolled hybridization, introgression genetic swamping which leads to homogenization or out-competition from the introduced (or hybrid) species.[31] Endemic populations can face such extinctions when new populations are imported or selectively bred by people, or when habitat modification brings previously isolated species into contact. Extinction is likeliest for rare species coming into contact with more abundant ones;[32] interbreeding can swamp the rarer gene pool and create hybrids, depleting the purebred gene pool (for example, the endangered wild water buffalo is most threatened with extinction by genetic pollution from the abundant domestic water buffalo). Such extinctions are not always apparent from morphological (non-genetic) observations. Some degree of gene flow is a normal evolutionarily process, nevertheless, hybridization (with or without introgression) threatens rare species' existence.[33][34]\\r\\nThe gene pool of a species or a population is the variety of genetic information in its living members. A large gene pool (extensive genetic diversity) is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense selection. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see inbreeding and population bottlenecks) reduces the range of adaptions possible.[35] Replacing native with alien genes narrows genetic diversity within the original population,[32][36] thereby increasing the chance of extinction.\\r\\nHabitat degradation is currently the main anthropogenic cause of species extinctions. The main cause of habitat degradation worldwide is agriculture, with urban sprawl, logging, mining and some fishing practices close behind. The degradation of a species' habitat may alter the fitness landscape to such an extent that the species is no longer able to survive and becomes extinct. This may occur by direct effects, such as the environment becoming toxic, or indirectly, by limiting a species' ability to compete effectively for diminished resources or against new competitor species.\\r\\nHabitat degradation through toxicity can kill off a species very rapidly, by killing all living members through contamination or sterilizing them. It can also occur over longer periods at lower toxicity levels by affecting life span, reproductive capacity, or competitiveness.\\r\\nHabitat degradation can also take the form of a physical destruction of niche habitats. The widespread destruction of tropical rainforests and replacement with open pastureland is widely cited as an example of this;[13] elimination of the dense forest eliminated the infrastructure needed by many species to survive. For example, a fern that depends on dense shade for protection from direct sunlight can no longer survive without forest to shelter it. Another example is the destruction of ocean floors by bottom trawling.[37]\\r\\nDiminished resources or introduction of new competitor species also often accompany habitat degradation. Global warming has allowed some species to expand their range, bringing unwelcome[according to whom?] competition to other species that previously occupied that area. Sometimes these new competitors are predators and directly affect prey species, while at other times they may merely outcompete vulnerable species for limited resources. Vital resources including water and food can also be limited during habitat degradation, leading to extinction.\\r\\nIn the natural course of events, species become extinct for a number of reasons, including but not limited to: extinction of a necessary host, prey or pollinator, inter-species competition, inability to deal with evolving diseases and changing environmental conditions (particularly sudden changes) which can act to introduce novel predators, or to remove prey. Recently in geological time, humans have become an additional cause of extinction (many people would say premature extinction) of some species, either as a new mega-predator or by transporting animals and plants from one part of the world to another. Such introductions have been occurring for thousands of years, sometimes intentionally (e.g. livestock released by sailors on islands as a future source of food) and sometimes accidentally (e.g. rats escaping from boats). In most cases, the introductions are unsuccessful, but when an invasive alien species does become established, the consequences can be catastrophic. Invasive alien species can affect native species directly by eating them, competing with them, and introducing pathogens or parasites that sicken or kill them; or indirectly by destroying or degrading their habitat. Human populations may themselves act as invasive predators. According to the \\"overkill hypothesis\\", the swift extinction of the megafauna in areas such as Australia (40,000 years before present), North and South America (12,000 years before present), Madagascar, Hawaii (300ÿ1000 CE), and New Zealand (1300ÿ1500 CE), resulted from the sudden introduction of human beings to environments full of animals that had never seen them before, and were therefore completely unadapted to their predation techniques.[38]\\r\\nCoextinction refers to the loss of a species due to the extinction of another; for example, the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their hosts. Coextinction can also occur when a species loses its pollinator, or to predators in a food chain who lose their prey. \\"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems?... While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one\\".[39] Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct. Models suggest that coextinction is the most common form of biodiversity loss. There may be a cascade of coextinction across the trophic levels. Such effects are most severe in mutualistic and parasitic relationships. An example of coextinction is the Haast's eagle and the moa: the Haast's eagle was a predator that became extinct because its food source became extinct. The moa were several species of flightless birds that were a food source for the Haast's eagle.[40]\\r\\nExtinction as a result of climate change has been confirmed by fossil studies.[41] Particularly, the extinction of amphibians during the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, 305 million years ago.[41] A 2003 review across 14 biodiversity research centers predicted that, because of climate change, 15ÿ37% of land species would be \\"committed to extinction\\" by 2050.[42][43] The ecologically rich areas that would potentially suffer the heaviest losses include the Cape Floristic Region, and the Caribbean Basin. These areas might see a doubling of present carbon dioxide levels and rising temperatures that could eliminate 56,000 plant and 3,700 animal species.[44] Climate change has also been found to be a factor in habitat loss and desertification.[45]\\r\\nThere have been at least five mass extinctions in the history of life on earth, and four in the last 350 million years in which many species have disappeared in a relatively short period of geological time. A massive eruptive event is considered to be one likely cause of the \\"PermianÿTriassic extinction event\\" about 250 million years ago,[46] which is estimated to have killed 90% of species then existing.[47] There is also evidence to suggest that this event was preceded by another mass extinction, known as Olson's Extinction.[46] The CretaceousÿPaleogene extinction event (K-Pg) occurred 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, and is best known for having wiped out non-avian dinosaurs, among many other species.\\r\\nAccording to a 1998 survey of 400 biologists conducted by New York's American Museum of Natural History, nearly 70% believed that the Earth is currently in the early stages of a human-caused mass extinction,[48] known as the Holocene extinction. In that survey, the same proportion of respondents agreed with the prediction that up to 20% of all living populations could become extinct within 30 years (by 2028). A 2014 special edition of Science declared there is widespread consensus on the issue of human-driven mass species extinctions.[49]\\r\\nBiologist E. O. Wilson estimated [13] in 2002 that if current rates of human destruction of the biosphere continue, one-half of all plant and animal species of life on earth will be extinct in 100 years.[50] More significantly, the current rate of global species extinctions is estimated as 100 to 1000 times \\"background\\" rates (the average extinction rates in the evolutionary time scale of planet Earth),[51][52] while future rates are likely 10,000 times higher.[52] However, some groups are going extinct much faster. Biologists Paul R. Ehrlich and Stuart Pimm, among others, contend that human population growth and overconsumption are the main drivers of the modern extinction crisis.[53][54][55][56]\\r\\nFor much of history, the modern understanding of extinction as the end of a species was incompatible with the prevailing worldview. Through the 18th century, much of Western society adhered to the belief that the world was created by God and as such was complete and perfect.[58] This concept reached its heyday in the 1700s with the peak popularity of a theological concept called the Great Chain of Being, in which all life on earth, from the tiniest microorganism to God, is linked in a continuous chain.[59] The extinction of a species was impossible under this model, as it would create gaps or missing links in the chain and destroy the natural order.[58][59] Thomas Jefferson was a firm supporter of the Great Chain of Being and an opponent of extinction,[58][60] famously denying the extinction of the wooly mammoth on the grounds that nature never allows a race of animals to become extinct.[61]\\r\\nA series of fossils were discovered in the late 17th century that appeared unlike any living species. As a result, the scientific community embarked on a voyage of creative rationalization, seeking to understand what had happened to these species within a framework that did not account for total extinction. In October 1686, Robert Hooke presented an impression of a nautilus to the Royal Society that was more than two feet in diameter,[62] and morphologically distinct from any known living species. Hooke theorized that this was simply because the species lived in the deep ocean and no one had discovered them yet.[59] While he contended that it was possible a species could be \\"lost\\", he thought this highly unlikely.[59] Similarly, in 1695, Thomas Molyneux published an account of enormous antlers found in Ireland that did not belong to any extant taxa in that area.[63][60] Molyneux reasoned that they came from the North American moose and that the animal had once been common on the British Isles.[63] Rather than suggest that this indicated the possibility of species going extinct, he argued that although organisms could become locally extinct, they could never be entirely lost and would continue to exist in some unknown region of the globe.[63] Using the antlers as evidence for this position, Molyneux described how moose had continued to exist in North America even as they were lost to the British Isles.[60] The antlers were later confirmed to be from the extinct Irish elk Megaloceros.[60] Hooke and Molyneux's line of thinking was difficult to disprove. When parts of the world had not been thoroughly examined and charted, scientists could not rule out that animals found only in the fossil record were not simply \\"hiding\\" in unexplored regions of the Earth.[64]\\r\\nGeorges Cuvier is credited with establishing the modern conception of extinction in a 1796 lecture to the French Institute,[61][57] though he would spend most of his career trying to convince the wider scientific community of his theory.[65] Cuvier was a well-regarded geologist, lauded for his ability to reconstruct the anatomy of an unknown species from a few fragments of bone.[57] His primary evidence for extinction came from mammoth skulls found in the Paris basin.[57] Cuvier recognized them as distinct from any known living species of elephant, and argued that it was highly unlikely such an enormous animal would go undiscovered.[57] In 1812, Cuvier, along with Alexandre Bronigniart & Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, mapped the strata of the Paris basin.[59] They saw alternating saltwater and freshwater deposits, as well as patterns of the appearance and disappearance of fossils throughout the record.[60][65] From these patterns, Cuvier inferred historic cycles of catastrophic flooding, extinction, and repopulation of the earth with new species.[60][65]\\r\\nCuviers fossil evidence showed that very different life forms existed in the past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists.[58] The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature.[65] Cuvier understood extinction to be the result of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time.[66] His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism.[66]\\r\\nJean-Baptist Lamarck, a gradualist and colleague of Cuvier, saw the fossils of different life forms as evidence of the mutable character of species.[65] While Lamarck did not deny the possibility of extinction, he believed that it was exceptional and rare and that most of the change in species over time was due to gradual change.[65] Unlike Cuvier, Lamarck was skeptical that catastrophic events of a scale large enough to cause total extinction were possible. In his geological history of the earth titled Hydrogeologie, Lamarck instead argued that the surface of the earth was shaped by gradual erosion and deposition by water, and that species changed over time in response to the changing environment.[65][67]\\r\\nCharles Lyell, a noted geologist and founder of uniformitarianism, believed that past processes should be understood using present day processes. Like Lamarck, Lyell acknowledged that extinction could occur, noting the total extinction of the dodo and the extirpation of indigenous horses to the British Isles.[59] He similarly argued against mass extinctions, believing that any extinction must be a gradual process.[57][61] Lyell also showed that Cuviers original interpretation of the Parisian strata was incorrect. Instead of the catastrophic floods inferred by Cuvier, Lyell demonstrated that patterns of saltwater and freshwater deposits, like those seen in the Paris basin, could be formed by a slow rise and fall of sea levels.[60]\\r\\nThe concept of extinction was integral to Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species, with less fit lineages disappearing over time. For Darwin, extinction was a constant side effect of competition.[68] Because of the wide reach of On the Origin of Species, it was widely accepted that extinction occurred gradually and evenly (a concept we now refer to as background extinction).[61] It was not until 1982, when David Raup and Jack Sepkoski published their seminal paper on mass extinctions, that Cuvier was vindicated and catastrophic extinction was accepted as an important mechanism. The current understanding of extinction is a synthesis of the cataclysmic extinction events proposed by Cuvier, and the background extinction events proposed by Lyell and Darwin.\\r\\nExtinction is an important research topic in the field of zoology, and biology in general, and has also become an area of concern outside the scientific community. A number of organizations, such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, have been created with the goal of preserving species from extinction. Governments have attempted, through enacting laws, to avoid habitat destruction, agricultural over-harvesting, and pollution. While many human-caused extinctions have been accidental, humans have also engaged in the deliberate destruction of some species, such as dangerous viruses, and the total destruction of other problematic species has been suggested. Other species were deliberately driven to extinction, or nearly so, due to poaching or because they were \\"undesirable\\", or to push for other human agendas. One example was the near extinction of the American bison, which was nearly wiped out by mass hunts sanctioned by the United States government, to force the removal of Native Americans, many of whom relied on the bison for food.[69]\\r\\nBiologist Bruce Walsh of the University of Arizona states three reasons for scientific interest in the preservation of species: genetic resources, ecosystem stability, and ethics;[70] and today the scientific community \\"stress[es] the importance\\" of maintaining biodiversity.[70][71]\\r\\nIn modern times, commercial and industrial interests often have to contend with the effects of production on plant and animal life. However, some technologies with minimal, or no, proven harmful effects on Homo sapiens can be devastating to wildlife (for example, DDT).[72] Biogeographer Jared Diamond notes that while big business may label environmental concerns as \\"exaggerated\\", and often cause \\"devastating damage\\", some corporations find it in their interest to adopt good conservation practices, and even engage in preservation efforts that surpass those taken by national parks.[73]\\r\\nGovernments sometimes see the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism,[74] and can enact laws with severe punishment against the trade in native species in an effort to prevent extinction in the wild. Nature preserves are created by governments as a means to provide continuing habitats to species crowded by human expansion. The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity has resulted in international Biodiversity Action Plan programmes, which attempt to provide comprehensive guidelines for government biodiversity conservation. Advocacy groups, such as The Wildlands Project[75] and the Alliance for Zero Extinctions,[76] work to educate the public and pressure governments into action.\\r\\nPeople who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment, leaving them highly exposed to extinction risks. However, people prioritize day-to-day survival over species conservation; with human overpopulation in tropical developing countries, there has been enormous pressure on forests due to subsistence agriculture, including slash-and-burn agricultural techniques that can reduce endangered species's habitats.[77]\\r\\nAntinatalist philosopher David Benatar concludes that any popular concern about non-human species extinction usually arises out of concern about how the loss of a species will impact human wants and needs, that \\"we shall live in a world impoverished by the loss of one aspect of faunal diversity, that we shall no longer be able to behold or use that species of animal.\\" He notes that typical concerns about possible human extinction, such as the loss of individual members, are not considered in regards to non-human species extinction.[78]\\r\\nThe poliovirus is now confined to small parts of the world due to extermination efforts.[81]\\r\\nDracunculus medinensis, a parasitic worm which causes the disease dracunculiasis, is now close to eradication thanks to efforts led by the Carter Center.[82]\\r\\nTreponema pallidum pertenue, a bacterium which causes the disease yaws, is in the process of being eradicated.\\r\\nBiologist Olivia Judson has advocated the deliberate extinction of certain disease-carrying mosquito species. In a September 25, 2003 New York Times article, she advocated \\"specicide\\" of thirty mosquito species by introducing a genetic element which can insert itself into another crucial gene, to create recessive \\"knockout genes\\".[83] She says that the Anopheles mosquitoes (which spread malaria) and Aedes mosquitoes (which spread dengue fever, yellow fever, elephantiasis, and other diseases) represent only 30 species; eradicating these would save at least one million human lives per annum, at a cost of reducing the genetic diversity of the family Culicidae by only 1%. She further argues that since species become extinct \\"all the time\\" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem: \\"We're not left with a wasteland every time a species vanishes. Removing one species sometimes causes shifts in the populations of other speciesbut different need not mean worse.\\" In addition, anti-malarial and mosquito control programs offer little realistic hope to the 300 million people in developing nations who will be infected with acute illnesses this year. Although trials are ongoing, she writes that if they fail: \\"We should consider the ultimate swatting.\\"[83]\\r\\nBiologist E. O. Wilson has advocated the eradication of several species of mosquito, including malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Wilson stated, \\"I'm talking about a very small number of species that have co-evolved with us and are preying on humans, so it would certainly be acceptable to remove them. I believe it's just common sense.\\"[84]\\r\\nSome, such as Harvard geneticist George M. Church, believe that ongoing technological advances will let us \\"bring back to life\\" an extinct species by cloning, using DNA from the remains of that species. Proposed targets for cloning include the mammoth, the thylacine, and the Pyrenean ibex. For this to succeed, enough individuals would have to be cloned, from the DNA of different individuals (in the case of sexually reproducing organisms) to create a viable population. Though bioethical and philosophical objections have been raised,[85] the cloning of extinct creatures seems theoretically possible.[86]\\r\\nIn 2003, scientists tried to clone the extinct Pyrenean ibex (C. p. pyrenaica). This attempt failed: of the 285 embryos reconstructed, 54 were transferred to 12 mountain goats and mountain goat-domestic goat hybrids, but only two survived the initial two months of gestation before they too died.[87] In 2009, a second attempt was made to clone the Pyrenean ibex: one clone was born alive, but died seven minutes later, due to physical defects in the lungs.[88]","input":"When is a species presumed to be extinct?"},{"output":"Azam Shah","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bibi Ka Maqbara (English:\\"Tomb of the Lady\\")[2] is a tomb located in  Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's son Azam Shah in the memory of his mother (posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani).[3][4][5][6][7][8] It bears a striking resemblance to the famous Taj Mahal,[7] the mausoleum of wife of Shah Jahan. He had built the Badshahi Mosque[9] at Lahore one of the largest Mosques in the world and the largest one at that time, as well as the small, but elegant, Pearl Mosque at Delhi.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe comparison to the Taj Mahal has often obscured its very own considerable charm.[10] Due to the strong resemblance, it is also called the Dakkhani Taj (Taj of the Deccan).[4] The Bibi Ka Maqbara is the principal monument of Aurangabad and its historic city.[6][11] An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively.[4] Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the principal designer of the Taj Mahal.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDilras Banu Begum was born a princess of the prominent Safavid dynasty of Iran (Persia)[13] and was the daughter of Mirza Badi-uz-Zaman Safavi (titled Shahnawaz Khan),[14] who was the Viceroy of Gujarat.[15] She married Prince Muhi-ud-din (later known as 'Aurangzeb' upon his accession) on 8 May 1637 in Agra.[16] Dilras was his first wife and chief consort, as well as his favourite.[17][18][19][20] She bore her husband five children: Zeb-un-Nissa, Zinat-un-Nissa, Zubdat-un-Nissa, Muhammad Azam Shah and Sultan Muhammad Akbar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter giving birth to her fifth child, Muhammad Akbar, Dilras Banu Begum possibly suffered from puerperal fever, due to complications caused by the delivery and died a month after the birth of her son on 8 October 1657. Upon her death, Aurangzeb's pain was extreme and their eldest son, Azam Shah, was so grieved that he had a nervous breakdown.[21] It became Dilras' eldest daughter, Princess Zeb-un-Nissa's responsibility to take charge of her newborn brother.[14] Zeb-un-Nissa doted on her brother a lot, and at the same time, Aurangzeb greatly indulged his motherless son and the prince soon became his best-loved son.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1668, Prince Azam Shah commissioned a mausoleum at Aurangabad to act as her final resting place, known as Bibi Ka Maqbara (\\"Tomb of the Lady\\"). Here, Dilras was buried under the posthumous title of 'Rabia-ud-Daurani' (\\"Rabia of the Age\\"). The Bibi Ka Maqbara bears a striking resemblance to the famous Taj Mahal, the mausoleum of Dilras' mother-in-law, Empress Mumtaz Mahal, who herself died in childbirth. Aurangzeb, himself, is buried a few kilometers away from her mausoleum in Khuldabad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBibi Ka Maqbara is believed to have been built between 1668 and 1669 C.E. According to the \\"Tarikh Namah\\" of Ghulam Mustafa, the cost of construction of the mausoleum was Rs. 668,203-7 (rupees six lakh, sixty-eight thousand, two hundred three and seven annas) ÿ Aurangzeb allocated only Rs. 700,000 for its construction.[23] An inscription found on the main entrance door mentions that this mausoleum was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively. The marble for this mausoleum was brought from mines near Jaipur. According to Tavernier, around three hundred carts laden with marble, drawn by at least 12 oxen, were seen by him during his journey from Surat to Golconda. The mausoleum was intended to rival the Taj Mahal, but the decline in architecture and proportions of the structure (both due to the severe budgetary constraints imposed by Aurangzeb) had resulted in a poor copy of the latter.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mausoleum is laid out in a Charbagh formal garden. It stands at the centre of a huge enclosure measuring approximately 458 m. N-S X 275 m. E-W. Baradaris or pillared pavilions are located at the centre of north, east and western part of the enclosure wall. The high enclosure wall is crenellated with pointed arched recesses and bastions at regular intervals. The recesses are divided by pilasters, crowned with small minarets. The mausoleum is built on a high square platform with four minarets at its corners, which is approached by a flight of steps from the three sides. A mosque is found to the west of the main structure, a later addition by the Nizam of Hyderabad, resulting in closure of the west entrance.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntry to the mausoleum is through a main entrance gate on its south, which has foliage designs on brass plate on wood covering from the exterior. After passing through the entrance a small tank is provided and a low profile screen wall leads to the main structure. The screened pathway has a series of fountains at its centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mausoleum is encased with marble up to the dado level. Above the dado level, it is constructed of basaltic trap up to the base of the dome; the latter is again built of marble. A fine plaster covers the basaltic trap and given a fine polished finish and adorned with fine stucco decorations. The mortal remains of Rabia Daurani are placed below the ground level surrounded by an octagonal jali pierced marble screen with exquisite designs, which can be approached by a descending flight of steps. The roof of this chamber that corresponds to the ground level of the mausoleum is pierced by an octagonal opening and given a low barricaded marble screen. This makes the tomb viewable from the ground level through this octagonal opening. The mausoleum is crowned by a dome pierced with trellis works and accompanying panels decorated with flower designs.[4] The structure is in the form of a hexagon, its angles ornamented with minarets.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nBibi Ka Maqbara has featured in a number of documentaries and films.

As of the 2010 census the city had a population of 16,641.[7] It is the county seat of Charlotte County[8] and the only incorporated municipality in the county. Punta Gorda is the principal city of the Punta Gorda, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area and is also in the Sarasota-Bradenton-Punta Gorda Combined Statistical Area.[9]\\r\\nPunta Gorda was the scene of massive destruction after Charley, a Category 4 hurricane, came through the city on August 13, 2004. Charley was the strongest tropical system to hit Florida since Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and the first hurricane since Hurricane Donna in 1960 to make a direct hit on Florida's southwest coast.[10] In the immediate years following the storm, buildings were restored or built to hurricane-resistant building codes. The new buildings, restorations and amenities concurrently preserved the city's past while showcasing newer facilities. During this time, Laishley Park Municipal Marina was built and the Harborwalk, Linear Park and various trails were created throughout the city for bicycle and pedestrian traffic.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name Punta Gorda (\\"Fat Point\\") has been on maps at least since 1851, referring to a point of land that juts into Charlotte Harbor, an estuary off the Gulf of Mexico. It was in the late 1800s that early settlers began to arrive in what is the present-day Punta Gorda area.[12]\\r\\nFrederick and Jarvis Howard, Union Army veterans, homesteaded an area south of the Peace River near present-day Punta Gorda about a decade after the close of the Civil War. In 1876, James and Josephine Lockhart bought land and built a house on property which is now at the center of the city.[12] Approximately two years later Lockhart sold his claim to James Madison Lanier, a hunter and trapper.[12]\\r\\nIn 1879, a charter for a railroad with termini at Charlotte Harbor and Lake City, Florida was established under the name Gainesville, Ocala, and Charlotte Harbor Railroad. It was taken over by the Florida Southern Railroad, which reaffirmed Charlotte Harbor as a terminus in its own charter.[13] Lanier with his wife lived there until 1883, when 30.8 acres (12.5?ha) were sold to Isaac Trabue, who purchased additional land along the harbor and directed the platting of a town (by Kelly B. Harvey) named \\"Trabue\\".[12] Harvey recorded the plat on February 24, 1885. At the time, Isaac was in Kentucky, and his cousin, John Trabue, was in charge of selling lots. Kelly, a native of the Peace River area, started referring to the new town as Punta Gorda. He later explained that the Spaniards called the area Punta Gorda, and local businesses included Punta gorda within their companies' names.[14]\\r\\nLess than ten years after the first settlements in the area, railroads rolled into the town of Trabue in June 1886, and with them came the first land developers and Southwest Florida's first batch of tourists.[15] Punta Gorda became the southernmost stop on the Florida Southern Railroad,[15] until an extension was built to Fort Myers in 1904,[16] attracting the industries that propelled its initial growth.\\r\\nIn 1887, 12 years after the first settlers trekked to Charlotte Harbor, 34 met at Hector's Billiard Parlor to discuss incorporation. Once Punta Gorda was officially incorporated, mayoral elections took place and a council was formed. The first mayor, W. H. Simmons, was elected. The new city was renamed Punta Gorda.[17]\\r\\nPhosphate was discovered on the banks of the Peace River just above Punta Gorda in 1888. Phosphate mined in the Peace River Valley was barged down the Peace River to Punta Gorda and Port Boca Grande, where it was loaded onto vessels for worldwide shipment. In 1896, the Florida Times-Union reported that phosphate mining was Punta Gorda's chief industry and that Punta Gorda was the greatest phosphate shipping point in the world. By 1907, a railroad was built direct to Port Boca Grande, ending the brief phosphate shipping boom from Punta Gorda.[18]\\r\\nIn 1890, the first postmaster, Robert Meacham, an African American, was appointed by Isaac Trabue as a deliberate affront to Kelly B. Harvey and those who had voted to change the name of the town from Trabue to Punta Gorda.[19]\\r\\nThe Punta Gorda Herald was founded by Robert Kirby Seward in 1893 and published weekly during its early years.The newspaper covered such events as rum running, other smuggling activities, and lawlessness in general.[20] It underwent many changes in both ownership and name over time, and today is known as The Charlotte Sun Herald.[21]\\r\\nEarly Punta Gorda greatly resembled the modern social climate of various classes living together and working together. While the regal Punta Gorda Hotel, at one point partly owned by Cornelius Vanderbilt, reflected the upper class, Punta Gorda was a pretty rough town, as most frontier towns were. Punta Gorda's location at the end of the railway line spiked the crime rate, resulting in approximately 40 murders between 1890 and 1904.[22] This included City Marshal John H. Bowman, who was shot and killed in his front parlor on January 29, 1903, in view of his family.[22][23]\\r\\nIn 1925, a bungalow was built by Joseph Blanchard, an African American sea captain and fisherman. The Blanchard House Museum still stands as a museum, providing education for the history of middle-class African American life in the area.[24]\\r\\nPunta Gorda in the 20th century still maintained steady growth. Charlotte County was formed in 1921 after DeSoto County was split. Also in 1921, the first bridge was constructed connecting Punta Gorda and Charlotte Harbor along the brand-new Tamiami Trail. This small bridge was replaced by the original Barron Collier Bridge in 1931, and then by the current Barron Collier Bridge and Gilchrist Bridge crossing the Peace River.\\r\\nDuring World War II, a U.S. Army airfield was built in Punta Gorda to train combat air pilots. After the war, the airfield was turned over to Charlotte County.[25] Today the old airfield is the Punta Gorda Airport, providing both commercial and general aviation.[26]\\r\\nPunta Gorda's next intense growth phase started in 1959 with the creation of a neighborhood of canal-front home sites, Punta Gorda Isles, by a trio of entrepreneurs, Al Johns, Bud Cole and Sam Burchers. They laid out 55 miles of canals 100 feet wide and 17 feet deep using dredged sand to raise the level of the canal front land. This provided dry home sites with access to the Charlotte Harbor and the Gulf of Mexico. Johns went on to develop several other communities in Punta Gorda,[27] among which were Burnt Store Isles, another waterfront community with golf course, and Seminole Lakes, a golf course community. These communities provided waterfront or golf course homes for retirees with access to a downtown with shopping, restaurants, and parks.\\r\\nIn the early 1980s at the site of the old Maud Street Fishing Docks, a new shopping, restaurant and marina complex, Fishermen's Village,[28] was constructed that continues to be one of Southwest Florida's primary attractions.[according to whom?]\\r\\nIn 2004, a major hurricane, Hurricane Charley, moved through Punta Gorda, damaging many buildings, but also creating an opportunity for revitalization of both the historic downtown and the waterfront. During the first part of the twenty-first century, Punta Gorda has continued to grow and improve, adding a new Harborwalk which continues to expand, a linear park which winds through the city, many new restaurants, and neighborhoods.\\r\\nA replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated on November 5, 2016.[29] The city also features the Whispering Giant statue, a public art sculpture of the face of a Native American man and a Native American woman.[30]\\r\\nThere are many historic places in Punta Gorda, including ten places on the National Register of Historic Places:\\r\\nPunta Gorda lies on the south bank of the tidal Peace River and the eastern shore of Charlotte Harbor, an arm of the Gulf of Mexico. Unincorporated communities bordering Punta Gorda include Charlotte Park (nearly surrounded by the city), Solana to the east, and Charlotte Harbor to the north, across the Peace River. Port Charlotte is to the west of Punta Gorda's incorporated residential neighborhoods Deep Creek[31] and Suncoast Lakes, north of the Peace River. Harbour Heights lies to the east of Punta Gorda's Deep Creek residential neighborhood.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.0 square miles (54.4?km2), of which 15.0 square miles (38.9?km2) is land and 6.0 square miles (15.5?km2) (28.52%) is water.[7]\\r\\nAs of October 5, 2017, Punta Gorda has eleven zoning districts, five overlay districts, and three planned development districts. Of the eleven zoning districts, six are designated for residential use, two for commercial use, one for governmental use, and two districts allow mixed-use.[32]\\r\\nAs of the census[4] of 2000, there were 14,344 people, 7,165 households, and 5,187 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,012.8 per square mile (391.1/km2). There were 8,907 housing units at an average density of 628.9 per square mile (242.9/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 94.60% White, 3.17% African American, 0.17% Native American, 0.78% Asian, 0.03% Pacific Islander, 0.59% from other races, and 0.68% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 1.99% of the population.\\r\\nThere were 7,165 households out of which 8.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.8% were married couples living together, 4.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 27.6% were non-families. 24.1% of all households were made up of individuals and 15.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.27.\\r\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 8.2% under the age of 18, 2.1% from 18 to 24, 9.9% from 25 to 44, 33.4% from 45 to 64, and 46.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 64 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 88.9 males.\\r\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $48,916, and the median income for a family was $54,879. Males had a median income of $34,054 versus $26,125 for females. The per capita income for the city was $32,460. About 4.7% of families and 6.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.9% of those under age 18 and 3.0% of those age 65 or over.\\r\\nPunta Gorda is home to five public schools operated by Charlotte County Public Schools: Charlotte High School, Punta Gorda Middle School, Sallie Jones Elementary School, East Elementary School, and the Baker Pre-K Center.[34] Good Shepherd Day School[35] is the only private grade school in Punta Gorda. Florida SouthWestern Collegiate High School,[36] located in Punta Gorda, is the county school district's only charter school.\\r\\nFlorida SouthWestern State College's Charlotte Campus is Punta Gorda's institution of higher learning.\\r\\nThe Punta Gorda Public Library is located in Punta Gorda, and is one of four branches composing the Charlotte County Library System.\\r\\nThe Punta Gorda Public Library was established in 1908, making it the oldest branch of the Charlotte County Library System, which was created in 1963.[37] The library was initially contained within an Episcopal Church rectory and was supervised by the vicar's wife, Theodosia Trout, until 1909.[37] The church that first housed this library still stands across the street today, under the name of the Church of the Good Shepherd. The library was eventually moved due to its popularity interfering with church activities.\\r\\nThe Masonic Lodge on Sullivan Street became the new home for the library due to its central location and popularity among established groups and clubs in Punta Gorda such as the Fortnightly Club and the Womens Civic Improvement Association.[37] The library remained in the lodge until 1928 when a hurricane damaged part of the roof. Many books were destroyed, and the volumes that could be salvaged were carried over to the new Women's Club building, where members adopted the library as a project. The library remained at the Women's Club building until land from the Retta Esplanade lot was donated for a new library in 1958.[37]\\r\\nIn 1973, the City of Punta Gorda donated the land at 424 West Henry Street for a new library,[37] This donation was intended for a playground, but with the permission of Mrs. Paschal B. Nobles who donated the land, construction began for the new library.\\r\\nOn July 22, 1974, the Paschal B. Nobles-Punta Gorda Public Library was opened to the public.[37] The current location of the Punta Gorda Public Library is still 424 West Henry Street. However, construction began in April 2018 for a new, larger library. The Punta Gorda Charlotte Library will be located at 401 Shreve Street, and will be equipped with new features such as study niches, conference rooms, and a local history and archive reading room.[38]\\r\\nU.S. Route 41, the Tamiami Trail, runs through the center of the city, leading south 23 miles (37?km) to Fort Myers and northwest 30 miles (48?km) to Venice. The southern terminus of U.S. Route 17 is in the center of Punta Gorda; the highway leads northeast 25 miles (40?km) to Arcadia and ultimately 1,206 miles (1,941?km) to its northern terminus in Winchester, Virginia. Interstate 75 bypasses Punta Gorda to the east, with access via U.S. 17 from Exit 164.\\r\\nIn 2010, over 90 percent of Punta Gorda commuters traveled by automobile, with about 81 percent driving alone and about nine percent carpooling.[39][not in citation given] According to the 2015 American Community Survey, about 88 percent of Punta Gorda commuters traveled by automobile, with about 78 percent driving alone and about ten percent carpooling. About six percent worked out of the home, with about six percent of commuters traveling by all other modes of transportation.[40]","input":"What county is punta gorda florida located in?"},{"output":"a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993","context":"Component Object Model (COM) is a binary-interface standard for software components introduced by Microsoft in 1993. It is used to enable inter-process communication object creation in a large range of programming languages. COM is the basis for several other Microsoft technologies and frameworks, including OLE, OLE Automation, Browser Helper Object, ActiveX, COM+, DCOM, the Windows shell, DirectX, UMDF and Windows Runtime. The essence of COM is a language-neutral way of implementing objects that can be used in environments different from the one in which they were created, even across machine boundaries. For well-authored components, COM allows reuse of objects with no knowledge of their internal implementation, as it forces component implementers to provide well-defined interfaces that are separated from the implementation. The different allocation semantics of languages are accommodated by making objects responsible for their own creation and destruction through reference-counting. Type conversion casting between different interfaces of an object is achieved through the QueryInterface method. The preferred method of \\"inheritance\\" within COM is the creation of sub-objects to which method \\"calls\\" are delegated.\\r\\nCOM is an interface technology defined and implemented as standard only on Microsoft Windows and Apple's Core Foundation 1.3 and later plug-in application programming interface (API).[1] The latter only implements a subset of the whole COM interface.[2] For some applications, COM has been replaced at least to some extent by the Microsoft .NET framework, and support for Web Services through the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). However, COM objects can be used with all .NET languages through .NET COM Interop. Networked DCOM uses binary proprietary formats, while WCF encourages the use of XML-based SOAP messaging. COM is very similar to other component software interface technologies, such as CORBA and Enterprise JavaBeans, although each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Unlike C++, COM provides a stable application binary interface (ABI) that does not change between compiler releases.[3] This makes COM interfaces attractive for object-oriented C++ libraries that are to be used by clients compiled using different compiler versions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first methods of interprocess communication in Windows was Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), first introduced in 1987, that allowed sending and receiving messages in so-called \\"conversations\\" between applications. Antony Williams involved in the creation of the COM architecture, later distributed two internal papers in Microsoft that embraced the concept of software components: Object Architecture: Dealing With the Unknown ÿ or ÿ Type Safety in a Dynamically Extensible Class Library in 1988 and On Inheritance: What It Means and How To Use It in 1990. These provided the foundation of many of the ideas behind COM. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), Microsoft's first object-based framework, was built on top of DDE and designed specifically for compound documents. It was introduced with Word for Windows and Excel in 1991, and was later included with Windows, starting with version 3.1 in 1992. An example of a compound document is a spreadsheet embedded in a Word for Windows document: as changes are made to the spreadsheet within Excel, they appear automatically inside the Word document.\\r\\nIn 1991, Microsoft have introduced Visual Basic Extensions (VBX) with Visual Basic 1.0. A VBX is a packaged extension in the form of a dynamic-link library (DLL) that allows objects to be graphically placed in a form and manipulated by properties and methods. These were later adapted for use by other languages such as Visual C++. In 1992, when version 3.1 of Windows was released, Microsoft released OLE 2 with its underlying object model. The COM Application binary interface (ABI) was the same as the MAPI ABI, which was released in 1992. While OLE 1 was focused on compound documents, COM and OLE 2 were designed to address software components in general. Text conversations and Windows messages had proved not to be flexible enough to allow sharing application features in a robust and extensible way, so COM was created as a new foundation, and OLE changed to OLE2. In 1994 OLE custom controls (OCXs) were introduced as the successor to VBX controls. At the same time, Microsoft stated that OLE 2 would just be known as \\"OLE\\", and that OLE was no longer an acronym, but a name for all of the company's component technologies. In early 1996, Microsoft found a new use for OLE Custom Controls, expanding their Web browser's capability to present content, renamed some parts of OLE relating to the Internet \\"ActiveX\\", and gradually renamed all OLE technologies to ActiveX, except the compound document technology that was used in Microsoft Office. Later that year, DCOM was introduced as an answer to CORBA.\\r\\nCOM was the major software development platform for Windows and, as such, influenced development of a number of supporting technologies.\\r\\nIn order for Microsoft to provide developers with support for distributed transactions, resource pooling, disconnected applications, event publication and subscription, better memory and processor (thread) management, as well as to position Windows as an alternative to other enterprise-level operating systems, Microsoft introduced a technology called Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) on Windows NT 4. With Windows 2000, that significant extension to COM was incorporated into the operating system (as opposed to the series of external tools provided by MTS) and renamed COM+. At the same time, Microsoft de-emphasized DCOM as a separate entity. Components that made use of COM+ services were handled more directly by the added layer of COM+, in particular by operating system support for interception. In the first release of MTS, interception was tacked on - installing an MTS component would modify the Windows Registry to call the MTS software, and not the component directly. Windows 2000 also revised the Component Services control panel application used to configure COM+ components.\\r\\nAn advantage of COM+ was that it could be run in \\"component farms\\". Instances of a component, if coded properly, could be pooled and reused by new calls to its initializing routine without unloading it from memory. Components could also be distributed (called from another machine). COM+ and Microsoft Visual Studio provided tools to make it easy to generate client-side proxies, so although DCOM was used to make the remote call, it was easy to do for developers. COM+ also introduced a subscriber/publisher event mechanism called COM+ Events, and provided a new way of leveraging MSMQ (inter-application asynchronous messaging) with components called Queued Components. COM+ events extend the COM+ programming model to support late-bound (see Late binding) events or method calls between the publisher or subscriber and the event system.\\r\\nMicrosoft .NET provides means both to provide component technology, and to interact with COM+ (via COM-interop-assemblies); .NET provides wrappers to most of the commonly used COM controls. Microsoft .NET hides most detail from component creation and therefore eases development. .NET can leverage COM+ via the System.EnterpriseServices namespace, and several of the services that COM+ provides have been duplicated in recent releases of .NET. For example, the System.Transactions namespace in .NET provides the TransactionScope class, which provides transaction management without resorting to COM+. Similarly, queued components can be replaced by Windows Communication Foundation with an MSMQ transport. (MSMQ is a native COM component, however.) There is limited support for backward compatibility. A COM object may be used in .NET by implementing a Runtime Callable Wrapper (RCW).[4] NET objects that conform to certain interface restrictions may be used in COM objects by calling a COM callable wrapper (CCW).[5] From both the COM and .NET sides, objects using the other technology appear as native objects. See COM Interop. WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) eases a number of COM's remote execution challenges. For instance, it allows objects to be transparently marshalled by value across process or machine boundaries more easily.\\r\\nMicrosoft's new Windows Runtime (or WinRT, not to be confused with Windows RT) programming and application model is essentially a COM-based API, although it relies on an enhanced COM. Because of its COM-like basis, Windows Runtime allows relatively easy interfacing from multiple languages, just as COM does, but it is essentially an unmanaged, native API. The API definitions are, however, stored in \\".winmd\\" files, which are encoded in ECMA 335 metadata format, the same CLI metadata format that .NET uses with a few modifications. This common metadata format allows for significantly less overhead than P/Invoke when WinRT is invoked from .NET applications, and its syntax is much simpler.\\r\\nCOM and ActiveX components are run as native code on the user's machine, with no sandboxing. There are therefore few restrictions on what the code can do. The prior practice of embedding ActiveX components on web pages with Internet Explorer did therefore lead to problems with malware infections. Microsoft recognized the problem with ActiveX as far back as 1996 when Charles Fitzgerald said, \\"We never made the claim up front that ActiveX is intrinsically secure\\".[6] Recent[when?] versions of Internet Explorer prompt the user before installing ActiveX controls, enabling the user to disallow installation of controls from sites that the user does not trust. The ActiveX controls are signed with digital signatures to guarantee their authenticity. It is also possible to disable ActiveX controls altogether, or to allow only a selected few. The transparent support for out-of-process COM servers still promotes software safety in terms of process isolation. This can be useful for decoupling subsystems of large application into separate processes. Process isolation limits state corruption in one process from negatively affecting the integrity of the other processes, since they only communicate through strictly defined interfaces. Thus, only the affected subsystem needs to be restarted in order to regain valid state. This is not the case for subsystems within the same process, where a rogue pointer in one subsystem can randomly corrupt other subsystems.\\r\\nCOM programmers build their software using COM-aware components. Different component types are identified by class IDs (CLSIDs), which are Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs). Each COM component exposes its functionality through one or more interfaces. The different interfaces supported by a component are distinguished from each other using interface IDs (IIDs), which are GUIDs too. COM interfaces have bindings in several languages, such as C, C++, Visual Basic, Delphi, Python[7][8] and several of the scripting languages implemented on the Windows platform. All access to components is done through the methods of the interfaces. This allows techniques such as inter-process, or even inter-computer programming (the latter using the support of DCOM).\\r\\nAll COM components implement the IUnknown (custom) interface, which exposes methods for reference counting and type conversion (casting). A custom IUnknown interface consists of a pointer to a virtual method table that contains a list of pointers to the functions that implement the functions declared in the interface, in the same order that they are declared in the interface. The in-process invocation overhead is therefore comparable to virtual method calls in C++. In addition to custom interfaces, COM also supports dispatch interfaces inheriting from IDispatch. Dispatch interfaces support late binding for OLE Automation. This allows dispatch interfaces to be natively accessed from a wider range of programming languages than custom interfaces.\\r\\nA COM class (\\"coclass\\") is a concrete implementation of one or more interfaces, and closely resembles classes in object-oriented programming languages. Classes are created based on their class ID (CLSID) or based on their programmatic identifier string (progid). Like many object-oriented languages, COM provides a separation of interface from implementation. This distinction is especially strong in COM, where objects cannot be accessed directly, but only through their interfaces. COM also has support for multiple implementations of the same interface, so that clients at runtime can choose which implementation of an interface to instantiate.\\r\\nType libraries contain metadata to represent COM types. These types are described using Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MSIDL/IDL). IDL files define object-oriented classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations and other user-defined types in a language independent manner. IDL is similar in appearance to C++ declarations with some additional keywords such as \\"interface\\" and \\"library\\" for defining interfaces and collections of classes. IDL also supports the use of bracketed attributes before declarations to provide additional information, such as interface GUIDs and the relationships between pointer parameters and length fields. IDL files are compiled by the MIDL compiler. For C/C++, the MIDL compiler generates a compiler-independent header file containing struct definitions to match the vtbls of the declared interfaces and a C file containing declarations of the interface GUIDs. C++ source code for a proxy module can also be generated by the MIDL compiler. This proxy contains method stubs for converting COM calls into remote procedure calls to enable DCOM for out-of-process communication. IDL files can also be compiled by the MIDL compiler into a type library (TLB). TLB files contain binary metadata that can be processed by different language compilers and runtime environments (e.g. VB, Delphi, .NET etc.) to generate language-specific constructs to represent the COM types defined in the TLB. For C++, this will convert the TLB back to its IDL representation.\\r\\nBecause COM is a runtime framework, types have to be individually identifiable and specifiable at runtime. To achieve this, globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) are used. Each COM type is designated its own GUID for identification at runtime. In order for information on COM types to be accessible at both compile time and runtime, COM uses type libraries. It is through the effective use of type libraries that COM achieves its capabilities as a dynamic framework for the interaction of objects.\\r\\nConsider the following example coclass definition in an IDL:\\r\\nThe above code fragment declares a COM class named SomeClass which implements an interface named ISomeInterface.\\r\\nThis is conceptually equivalent to defining the following C++ class:\\r\\nwhere ISomeInterface is a C++ pure virtual class.\\r\\nThe IDL files containing COM interfaces and classes are compiled into type libraries (TLB) files, which can later be parsed by clients at runtime to determine which interfaces an object supports, and invoke an object's interface methods.\\r\\nIn C++, COM objects are instantiated with the CoCreateInstance function that takes the class ID (CLSID) and interface ID (IID) as arguments. Instantiation of SomeClass can be implemented as follows:\\r\\nIn this example, the COM sub-system is used to obtain a pointer to an object that implements ISomeInterface interface, and coclass CLSID_SomeClass's particular implementation of this interface is required.\\r\\nAll COM objects utilize reference counting to manage object lifetimes. The reference counts are controlled by the clients through the AddRef and Release methods in the mandatory IUnknown interface that all COM objects implement. COM objects are then responsible for freeing their own memory when the reference count drops to zero. Certain languages (e.g. Visual Basic) provide automatic reference counting so that COM object developers need not explicitly maintain any internal reference counter in their source codes. In C++, a coder may either perform explicit reference counting or use smart pointers to automatically manage the reference counts.\\r\\nThe following are guidelines for when to call AddRef and Release on COM objects:\\r\\nNot all reference count calls are sent to remote objects over the wire; a proxy keeps only one reference on the remote object and maintains its own local reference count. To simplify COM development, Microsoft introduced ATL (Active Template Library) for C++ developers. ATL provides for a higher-level COM development paradigm. It also shields COM client application developers from the need to directly maintain reference counting, by providing smart pointer objects. Other libraries and languages that are COM-aware include the Microsoft Foundation Classes, the VC Compiler COM Support,[9] VBScript, Visual Basic, ECMAScript (JavaScript) and Borland Delphi.\\r\\nCOM is a language agnostic binary standard that can be developed in any programming language capable of understanding and implementing its binary defined data types and interfaces. COM implementations are responsible for entering and leaving the COM environment, instantiating and reference-counting COM objects, querying objects for supported interfaces, as well as handling errors. The Microsoft Visual C++ compiler supports extensions to the C++ language referred to as C++ Attributes.[10] These extensions are designed to simplify COM development and remove much of the plumbing code required to implement COM servers in C++.[11]\\r\\nIn Windows, COM classes, interfaces and type libraries are listed by GUIDs in the registry, under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\CLSID for classes and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\\\Interface for interfaces. COM libraries use the registry to locate either the correct local libraries for each COM object or the network location for a remote service.\\r\\nRegistration-Free COM (RegFree COM) is a technology introduced with Windows XP that allows Component Object Model (COM) components to store activation metadata and CLSID (Class ID) for the component without using the registry. Instead, the metadata and CLSIDs of the classes implemented in the component are declared in an assembly manifest (described using XML), stored either as a resource in the executable or as a separate file installed with the component.[12] This allows multiple versions of the same component to be installed in different directories, described by their own manifests, as well as XCOPY deployment.[13] This technique has limited support for EXE COM servers[14] and cannot be used for system-wide components such as MDAC, MSXML, DirectX or Internet Explorer.\\r\\nDuring application loading, the Windows loader searches for the manifest.[15] If it is present, the loader adds information from it to the activation context.[13] When the COM class factory tries to instantiate a class, the activation context is first checked to see if an implementation for the CLSID can be found. Only if the lookup fails is the registry scanned.[13]\\r\\nCOM objects can also be created manually, given the path of the DLL file and GUID of the object. This does not require the DLL or GUID to be registered in the system registry, and does not make use of manifest files. A COM DLL exports a function named DllGetClassObject. Calling DllGetClassObject with the desired GUID and IID_IClassFactory provides an instance of a factory object. The Factory object has a CreateInstance method, which can create instances of an object given an interface GUID.[16] This is the same process internally used when creating instances of registered COM components.[17]\\r\\nIf the created COM object instantiates another COM object using the generic CoCreateInstance API, it will try to do so in the usual generic way, using the registry or manifest files. But it can create internal objects (which may not be registered at all), and hand out references to interfaces to them, using its own private knowledge.\\r\\nCOM objects can be transparently instantiated and referenced from within the same process (in-process), across process boundaries (out-of-process), or remotely over the network (DCOM). Out-of-process and remote objects use marshalling to serialize method calls and return values over process or network boundaries. This marshalling is invisible to the client, which accesses the object as if it were a local in-process object.\\r\\nIn COM, threading is addressed through a concept known as apartments.[18] An individual COM object lives in exactly one apartment, which might either be single-threaded or multi-threaded. There are three types of apartments in COM: Single-Threaded Apartment (STA), Multi-Threaded Apartment (MTA), and Thread Neutral Apartment (NA). Each apartment represents one mechanism whereby an object's internal state may be synchronized across multiple threads. A process can consist of multiple COM objects, some of which may use STA and others of which may use MTA. All threads accessing COM objects similarly live in one apartment. The choice of apartment for COM objects and threads are determined at run-time, and cannot be changed.\\r\\nThreads and objects which belong to the same apartment follow the same thread access rules. Method calls which are made inside the same apartment are therefore performed directly without any assistance from COM. Method calls made across apartments are achieved via marshalling. This requires the use of proxies and stubs.\\r\\nSince COM has a fairly complex implementation, programmers can be distracted by some of the \\"plumbing\\" issues.\\r\\nWhen an STA is initialized it creates a hidden window that is used for inter-apartment and inter-process message routing. This window must have its message queue regularly \\"pumped\\". This construct is known as a \\"message pump\\". On earlier versions of Windows, failure to do so could cause system-wide deadlocks. This problem is complicated by some Windows APIs that initialize COM as part of their implementation, which causes a \\"leak\\" of implementation details.\\r\\nReference counting within COM may cause problems if two or more objects are circularly referenced. The design of an application must take this into account so that objects are not left orphaned. Objects may also be left with active reference counts if the COM \\"event sink\\" model is used. Since the object that fires the event needs a reference to the object reacting to the event, the latter's reference count will never reach zero. Reference cycles are typically broken using either out-of-band termination or split identities. In the out-of-band termination technique, an object exposes a method which, when called, forces it to drop its references to other objects, thereby breaking the cycle. In the split identity technique, a single implementation exposes two separate COM objects (also known as identities). This creates a weak reference between the COM objects, preventing a reference cycle.\\r\\nBecause in-process COM components are implemented in DLL files and registration only allows for a single version per CLSID they might in some situations be subject to the \\"DLL Hell\\" effect. Registration-free COM capability attempts to work around this problem.","input":"What is component object model in c#?"},{"output":"Palestinian territories","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestinian territories has been used for many years to describe the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. More recently, the official United Nations terminology [7] has been used, occupied Palestinian territory[8][9][10] (OPT or oPt) increasingly replacing other terms since 1999 [11]. The European Union also has adopted this usage [12][13] The International Court of Justice refers to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as \\"the Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" and this term is used as the legal definition by the International Court of Justice in the ruling in July 2004.[14] The term occupied Palestinian territories is also still in common use.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term \\"Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" was used by the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations between October 1999[15] to December 2012 in order to refer to areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority. On 29 November, 2012, UNGA 67/19 reaffirmed \\"the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to independence in their State of Palestine on the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\\" and decided \\"to accord to Palestine non-member observer State status in the United Nations\\". In December 2012, a UN legal memorandum discussed appropriate terminology to be used following GA 67/19. [16] It was noted therein that there was no legal impediment to using the designation Palestine to refer to the geographical area of the Palestinian territory. At the same time,it was explained that there was also no bar to the continued use of the term \\"Occupied Palestinian Territory including East Jerusalem\\" or such other terminology as might customarily be used by the Assembly.[17] The ISO adopted the name change in 2013.[18] The UN Security Council continues to treat Palestine as a non-sovereign entity, [19] preventing its admission to UN General Assembly membership as a full member state.[20] Israeli governments have maintained that the area involved is within territorial dispute.[21][22] The extent of the territories, while subject to future negotiations, have frequently been defined by the Green Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael occupied the territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the Six-Day War of 1967 and has since maintained control. Previously, these territories had been ruled by Jordan and Egypt, respectively, since the 1948 founding of Israel. In 1980, Israel officially absorbed East Jerusalem and has proclaimed the whole of Jerusalem to be its capital. The inclusion, though never formally amounting to legal annexation, was condemned internationally[23] and declared \\"null and void\\" by the United Nations Security Council.[24][25] The Palestinian National Authority, the United Nations,[26] the international legal and humanitarian bodies[27][28] and the international community [29][30] regard East Jerusalem as part of the West Bank, and consequently a part of the Palestinian territories. The Palestinian National Authority never exercised sovereignty over the area, although it housed its offices in Orient House and several other buildings as an assertion of its sovereign interests.[31][32] Israeli sovereignty, however, has not been recognized by any country, since the unilateral annexation of territory occupied during war contravenes the Fourth Geneva Convention.[33][34] The cost of the occupation for Israel over four decades (1967ÿ2007) is estimated to amount to $50 billion.[35] The World Bank estimates the annual cost in 2013 to the Palestinian economy of Israeli occupation at $3.4 billion.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) intention to declare a Palestinian State, Jordan renounced all territorial claims to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.[37] Since the Palestinian Declaration of Independence in 1988, 135 UN Member Nations have recognized the State of Palestine, comprising the Palestinian territories. It has not been recognized by Israel and some Western nations, including the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1993, following the Oslo Accords, parts of the territories politically came under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (Areas A and B). Israel still exercises full military control and, civil control over 61% of the West Bank (Area C). The Oslo Accords established access to the sea for Gaza within 20 nautical miles from the shore. The Berlin Commitment of 2002 reduced this to 12 miles (19?km). In October 2006 Israel imposed a 6-mile limit, and at the conclusion of the Gaza War restricted access to a 3-nautical-mile limit, beyond which a no-go zone exists. As a result, more than 3,000 Palestinian fishermen are denied access to 85% of the maritime areas agreed to in 1995.[38] The majority of the Dead Sea area is off-limits to Palestinian use, and Palestinians are denied access to its coast line.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael disengaged from the Gaza Strip in 2005, however the international community considers the West Bank and the Gaza Strip still to be occupied by Israel.[9] The Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007 divided the Palestinian territories politically. Abbas's Fatah largely ruled the West Bank and was recognized internationally as the official Palestinian Authority (see: Fatah-Hamas conflict).[40] In 2014, the two political groups agreed to hold elections and form a compromise unity government.[41] The 2014 IsraelÿGaza conflict intervened; however, the unity government survived.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Nations, the European Union, International Committee of the Red Cross, and the government of the United Kingdom all refer to the \\"Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" or \\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\\".[43][44][45]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther terms used to describe these areas collectively include \\"the disputed territories\\", and \\"Israeli-occupied territories\\". Further terms include \\"Palestine\\", \\"State of Palestine\\", \\"Yesha\\" (Judea-Samaria-Gaza), \\"Yosh\\" (Judea and Samaria), the \\"Katif Bloc\\" (the south-west corner of the Gaza Strip), \\"Palestinian Autonomous Areas\\"[46] (although this term is also used to specifically refer to Areas A and B),[47] \\"Palestinian Administered Territories\\",[46] \\"administered territories\\", \\"territories of undetermined permanent status\\", \\"1967 territories\\", and simply \\"the territories\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Arab and Islamic leaders,[who?] including some Palestinians,[who?] use the designation \\"Palestine\\" and \\"occupied Palestine\\" to imply a Palestinian political or religious claim to sovereignty over the whole former territory of the British Mandate west of the Jordan River, including all of Israel.[48][citation needed] Many[who?] of them view the land of Palestine as an Islamic Waqf (trust) for future Muslim generations. A parallel exists in the aspirations of David Ben-Gurion,[49] Menachem Begin,[50] and other Zionists and Jewish religious leaders[who?] to establish Jewish sovereignty over all of Greater Israel in trust for the Jewish people.[51][52] However, this dispute is not related to religion for many Arabs, but simply an issue of rights, as the land was inhabited by Arabs (as well as a minority of Jews) before the Zionist movement began.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Israelis[who?] object to the term \\"Occupied Palestinian Territories\\" and similar descriptions because they maintain such designations disregard Israeli claims to the West Bank and Gaza, or prejudice negotiations involving possible border changes, arguing that the armistice line agreed to after the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War was not intended as a permanent border. Dore Gold wrote, \\"It would be far more accurate to describe the West Bank and Gaza Strip as \\"disputed territories\\" to which both Israelis and Palestinians have claims.\\"[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palestinian Territories consist of two distinct areas: the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip. Although the boundaries are commonly referred to as the \\"1967 borders\\", they are historically the armistice lines under the 1949 Armistice Agreements, which brought an end to the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War, and are commonly referred to as the Green Line. The 1949 armistice lines were expressly declared to be armistice lines, and not international borders. Some Palestinian negotiators have claimed a return to those lines as the borders of a future Palestinian state, while Hamas does not recognize the State of Israel at all.[55] The Arab League has supported these boundaries as the borders of the future State of Palestine in the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe eastern limit of the West Bank is the border with Jordan. The IsraelÿJordan peace treaty defined that border as the international border, and Jordan renounced all claims to territory west of it. The border segment between Jordan and the West Bank was left undefined pending a definitive agreement on the status of the territory.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe southern limit of the Gaza Strip is the border with Egypt. Egypt renounced all claims to land north of the international border, including the Gaza Strip, in the EgyptÿIsrael Peace Treaty. The Palestinians were not parties to either agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Gaza Strip is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea. The natural geographic boundary of the West Bank, as the name implies, is the Jordan River. To the Territories belong the territorial waters of the Gaza Strip and the part of the Dead Sea between the West Bank and the Jordan border-line (see adjacent CIA map),[1] which are also completely controlled by Israel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palestinian territories are part of the area intended by the United Nations to become the territory of the future State of Palestine.[56] Originally, a larger area was allotted to the planned Palestinian state in Resolution 181 of 29 November 1947, but the Arabs rejected it and in the 1948 Palestine war, the Israeli army conquered major parts of it. While in the Partition Plan about 45% of historic Palestine was destined for the Arabic state, the Palestinian territories constitute only some 23%.[57] The last figure is including all space occupied by Israeli settlements, walls and roads.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UN, nearly all countries voted in favour of Resolution 58/292 of 17 May 2004; namely, that the boundaries of a future Palestinian state should be based on the pre-1967 borders, which correspond with the Green Line. The Resolution affirmed, in connection with the Palestinian right to self-determination and to sovereignty, that the independent State of Palestine should be based on the pre-1967 borders.[56] In Resolution 43/177 of 15 December 1988, the declaration of independence of the State of Palestine was acknowledged by the UN General Assembly,[58] but it was not admitted as a member state. In the same resolution, their sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territories was recognized.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 November 2012, the UN General Assembly passed United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 changing Palestine's observer status at the UN from \\"entity\\" to \\"non-member state\\" by a vote of 138 to 9, with 41 abstentions.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediately after the Six-Day War of June 1967, Israel effectively annexed East Jerusalem, an area comprising the much smaller prior Jordanian municipality of east Jerusalem and a surrounding area of the West Bank, as far as Kalandia to the north and Har Homa to the south. Israeli law, jurisdiction and administration were applied to this area, which was also made part of the Israeli Jerusalem municipality in its entirety. East Jerusalem residents became Israeli residents with blue Israeli ID cards. In 1980, the Knesset elevated the issue of the unity of Jerusalem to constitutional status by enacting Basic Law: Jerusalem the Capital of Israel, an act which was condemned by much of the world community, the few, mainly Latin American, embassies maintained in west Jerusalem promptly moving to Tel Aviv. Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem lacks international recognition by any country. Seven UNSC resolutions, including United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared it \\"null and void\\" and required that it be rescinded, stating that it was a violation of international law (the Fourth Geneva Convention). The United Nations never explicitly recognized Jerusalem as part of either Israel or Palestine, as Resolution 181 (1947) was never revoked. In Resolution 181, Jerusalem was intended to become a corpus separatum under international regime. Nevertheless, most countries, including the United States, implicitly recognize West Jerusalem as part of Israel, but do not recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.[61][62][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nPalestinians regard East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian state. East Jerusalem is generally recognized as part of the Palestinian Territories. In UN resolutions concerning Israel, East Jerusalem is routinely referred to as part of the West Bank or as part of the Palestinian Territories.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Israeli Supreme Court, the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits unilateral annexation of occupied territory, does not[dubious  ÿ discuss] apply to East Jerusalem, as there was no[dubious  ÿ discuss] \\"legitimate sovereign\\"[citation needed] recognised by Israel and its allies previously exercising control over the territory. In Israel, there has always been large support for retaining all of Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty, although opinions differ regarding the large number of outlying Palestinian villages and neighbourhoods annexed to Jerusalem beyond \\"core\\" East Jerusalem (the Old City, Sheikh Jarrah and the large post-1967 Jewish neighborhoods such as Ramot, Ramat Eshkol, French Hill and Gilo). A few times, there were Israeli or U.S. proposals to divide East Jerusalem between Israel and the Palestinians. In the 1995 BeilinÿAbu Mazen agreement, Israeli negotiators proposed Palestinian sovereignty over some Arab neighborhoods within an expanded Jerusalem that would include annexed Israeli neighborhoods and major settlement blocs. In 2000, U.S. president Bill Clinton offered a similar proposal in his Clinton Parameters. In more recent years, the Israeli position has strongly been favourable to keeping all of Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Israel pulled all its remaining forces out of the Gaza Strip and dismantled its settlements. Nevertheless, according to the international community, the Gaza Strip is still considered to be occupied by Israel.[9] Israel has denied that it occupies the Gaza Strip, but two of the three border sectors of the Gaza Strip, together with the coast and airspace, are controlled by Israel (the third border sector near Rafah is controlled by Egypt).[63][64] The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 stated in 2007:\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael remains an occupying Power in respect of Gaza. Arguments that Israel ceased its occupation of Gaza in 2005 following the evacuation of its settlements and the withdrawal of its troops take no account of the fact that Israel retains effective control over Gaza by means of its control over Gaza's external borders, airspace, territorial waters, population registry, tax revenues and governmental functions. The effectiveness of this control is emphasized by regular military incursions and rocket attacks.[65]\\r\\nThe political status of the territories has been the subject of negotiations between Israel and the PLO and of numerous statements and resolutions by the United Nations. (See List of United Nations resolutions concerning Israel.) Since 1994, the autonomous Palestinian National Authority has exercised various degrees of control in large parts of the territories, as a result of the Declaration of Principles contained in the Oslo Accords. The United States government considers the West Bank and Gaza as a single entity for political, economic, legal and other purposes.[66] The State Department and other U.S. government agencies, such as USAID West Bank and Gaza,[67] have been tasked with projects in the areas of democracy, governance, resources, and infrastructure. Part of the USAID mission is to provide flexible and discrete support for implementation of the Quartet Road Map.[68] The Road Map is an internationally backed plan that calls for the progressive development of a viable Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza. Participating states provide assistance through direct contributions or through the Palestinian State account established by the World Bank.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nHamas won a majority of seats in elections for the Palestinian Parliament in 2006 and formed a government in Ramallah for the entire PA largely shunned by the United States and Israel. However the Fatah movement continued to dominate the PA security forces in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip by force, executing PA officers and removing its officials, many of whom, such as Muhammad Dahlan, escaped the Gaza Strip with their families. Mahmoud Abbas promptly deposed the Hamas-dominated PA government, and two rival administrations were created, a Fatah-controlled one in the West Bank, with which Israel, the US and the EU resumed business, and a Hamas-controlled one in the Gaza Strip which was largely shunned by the world community. After Hamas intensified rocket and mortar fire on Israeli civilian centers from the Gaza Strip, the United States and Israel instituted a military and economic blockade of the Gaza Strip.[70][71] When that failed to topple the new government, a covert operation was launched to eliminate Hamas by force.[72][73][74] The covert initiative was exposed when confidential State Department documents were accidentally leaked by the U.S. envoy. The talking points delivered to the Fatah leadership said:\\r\\n\\r\\nHamas should be given a clear choice, with a clear deadline: they either accept a new government that meets the Quartet principles, or they reject it. The consequences of Hamas' decision should also be clear: If Hamas does not agree within the prescribed time, you should make clear your intention to declare a state of emergency and form an emergency government explicitly committed to that platform.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Battle of Gaza (2007), the administration of the territories has been contested by two rival factions of the Palestinian National Authority, with Hamas controlling the Gaza Strip and Fatah continuing to administer the West Bank. Both groups claim legitimacy over leadership of the Palestinian territories. Most countries with an interest in the issues, including most of the Arab countries, recognize the administration of Mahmoud Abbas as the legitimate government over both Palestinian Territories.[who?]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring Operation Cast Lead the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1860 (2009), which said that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 that will be a part of the Palestinian state.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 December 2011, Iceland recognized Palestine as an independent and sovereign state within the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders; ?ssur Skarpheinsson, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iceland, and Dr. Riad Malki, the Foreign Minister of Palestine, formally confirmed the establishment of full diplomatic relations between Iceland and Palestine.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2014 FatahÿHamas Gaza Agreement provided for elections and the formation of a compromise unity government.[41] The 2014 IsraelÿGaza conflict intervened, however the unity government survived. In August, Palestinian leaders said they would apply to the United Nations Security Council for the establishment of a timetable for ending the Israeli occupation in the West Bank. The application would be made on 15 September 2014, following an Arab League meeting on 5 September at which support for the move would be requested. Unless a timetable was established, the Palestinian leadership said it would apply to the International Criminal Court where it would hold Israel responsible for its actions not only in the West Bank, but in the Gaza Strip.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international community regards the West Bank as territories occupied by Israel. Israel has withdrawn its military forces from the Gaza strip, but it continues to be designated the occupying power in the Gaza Strip by the United Nations, the United States and various human rights organizations.[78] Hillel Neuer, the executive Director of UN Watch argues that the co-founder of Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar, has stated that Gaza is no longer occupied since the Israeli withdrawal.[79][80] Zahar has elsewhere referred to the situation in Gaza as an \\"occupation\\".[81] The final status of the Palestinian Territories as an independent state is supported by the countries that form the Quartet's \\"Road map for peace\\". The government of Israel has also accepted the road map but with 14 reservations.[82]\\r\\n\\r\\nA transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho took place pursuant to the IsraelÿPLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. In other areas of the West Bank, transfer of powers took place pursuant to the IsraelÿPLO 28 September 1995 Interim Agreement, the IsraelÿPLO 15 January 1997 Protocol Concerning the Redeployment in Hebron, the IsraelÿPLO 23 October 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 4 September 1999 Sharm el-Sheikh Agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for external security and for internal security and public order of Israeli settlements and citizens. Direct negotiations to determine the permanent status of Gaza and the West Bank had begun in September 1999 after a three-year hiatus, but have been derailed by the al-Aqsa Intifada that began in September 2000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, the Israeli government issued a plan for total withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and part of the northern West Bank by late 2005. This became known as the Disengagement Plan. The Palestinian Authority welcomed this plan, but declared that until final status, it would still consider the Gaza Strip under Israeli occupation. Many Israelis opposed the plan, and tensions were very high in Israel before and after the Disengagement Plan was approved by the Israeli Knesset on 16 February 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2005, the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli police forcibly removed all settlers from the Gaza Strip. Israel completed the disengagement on 12 September 2005. Presently, most of the West Bank is administered by Israel though 42% of it is under varying degrees of autonomous rule by the Fatah-run Palestinian Authority. The Gaza Strip is currently under the control of Hamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is an independent international treaty organisation with its own legislative assembly. Many of the member states recognise the State of Palestine. The Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki presented the ICC prosecutor with documentary evidence which shows that 67 states in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe have legally recognised the State of Palestine.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2010, King Abdullah of Jordan, after a meeting with the Israeli president Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, declared that his country does not want to rule the West Bank and that \\"the two-state solution\\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the only viable option. If rule over the territory was to be transferred to the kingdom, it would only \\"replace Israeli military rule with Jordanian military rule... and the Palestinians want their own state\\".[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Thursday, 29 November 2012, In a 138ÿ9 vote (with 41 abstaining) General Assembly resolution 67/19 passed, upgrading Palestine to \\"non-member observer state\\" status in the United Nations.[85][86] The new status equates Palestine's with that of the Holy See. The change in status was described by The Independent as \\"de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine\\".[87] The vote was a historic benchmark for the partially recognised State of Palestine and its citizens, whilst it was a diplomatic setback for Israel and the United States. Status as an observer state in the UN will allow the State of Palestine to join treaties and specialised UN agencies, including the International Civil Aviation Organisation,[88] the International Criminal Court, and other organisations for recognised sovereign nations. It shall permit Palestine to claim legal rights over its territorial waters and air space as a sovereign state recognised by the UN, and allow the Palestinian people the right to sue for control of their claimed territory in the International Court of Justice and to bring war-crimes charges against Israel in the International Criminal Court.[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomary international law, including the International Court of Justice's interpretation of the Fourth Geneva Convention in their July 2004 ruling, has been widely interpreted as prohibiting Israel from building settlements, due to its clauses prohibiting the transfer of a civilian population into an occupied territory.[90] This was reaffirmed 5 December 2001, at the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention. The participating High Contracting Parties called upon Israel \\"to fully and effectively respect the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and to refrain from perpetrating any violation of the Convention. They reaffirm the illegality of the settlements in the said territories and of the extension thereof.\\"[91]  Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits any change of status in occupied territory concluded through negotiations between the occupying power and local authorities under occupation. This finding also suggests that Israel may be in violation of the Rome Statute (one of the primary legal instruments of the International Criminal Court), Article 8, section (2)(b)(viii): \\"The transfer, directly or indirectly, by the Occupying Power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies, or the deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory\\" see:.[92] Given that United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19 upgraded Palestine to non-member observer state status in November 2012, representatives of Palestine may now be able to take members of the Israeli government to the International Criminal Court under violations of the Rome Statute. On 31 January 2012, the United Nations independent \\"International Fact-Finding Mission on Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\\" filed a report stating that if Israel did not stop all settlement activity immediately and begin withdrawing all settlers from the West Bank, it potentially might face a case at the International Criminal Court, increasing credibility of any Palestinianin attempt to do so.[93][94][95]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN has, after granting Palestine observer state status, permitted Palestine to title its representative office to the UN as 'The Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations',[96] seen by many as a reflexion of the UN's de facto recognition of the State of Palestine's sovereignty,[85] and Palestine has started to re-title its name accordingly on postal stamps, official documents and passports.[86][97] The Palestinian authorities have also instructed its diplomats to officially represent 'The State of Palestine', as opposed to the 'Palestine National Authority'.[86] Additionally, on 17 December 2012,  UN Chief of Protocol Yeocheol Yoon decided that 'the designation of \\"State of Palestine\\" shall be used by the Secretariat in all official United Nations documents'.[98]\\r\\n\\r\\nCritics point out that implementation of the Oslo Accords has not improved conditions for the population under occupation.[99] Israel contends that the settlements are not illegal as the West Bank is considered a \\"disputed territory\\" under international law. United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 recognized Israel's rights to \\"safe and secure borders\\", which has been interpreted by Israeli government as meaning that Israel had a right to West Bank territory for secure borders. The San Remo Conference, binding under international law, further envisioned the West Bank as being part of a sovereign Jewish state, and arguably encourages, rather than prohibits Jewish settlement in the area. Furthermore, according to Israeli government, many of the settlements were established on the sites of former Jewish communities that had existed there prior to 1947 on land that was legitimately bought, and ethnically cleansed by Arab forces. Israel views the territory as being the subject of legitimate diplomatic dispute and negotiation under international law.[100][101] East Jerusalem, captured in 1967, was unilaterally annexed by Israel. The UN Security Council Resolution 478 condemned the annexation as \\"a violation of international law\\". This annexation has not been recognized by other nations, although the United States Congress declared its intention to recognize the annexation (a proposal that has been condemned by other states and organizations). Because of the question of Jerusalem's status, no states base their diplomatic missions there and treat Tel Aviv as the capital,[102] though two states have embassies in the Jerusalem suburb of Mevaseret Zion. Israel asserts that these territories are not currently claimed by any other state, and that Israel has the right to control them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael's position has not been accepted by most countries and international bodies, and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip are referred to as occupied territories (with Israel as the occupying power) by most international legal and political bodies,[103] the rest of the Arab bloc, the UK,[104] including the EU, the United States,[105][106] both the General Assembly and Security Council of the United Nations,[103] the International Court of Justice, the Conference of High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention,[107] and the Israeli Supreme Court (see Israeli West Bank barrier).\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer U.S. President George W. Bush stated, during his presidency, that he did not expect Israel to return entirely to pre-1967 borders, due to \\"new realities on the ground.\\"[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth US President Bill Clinton and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who played notable roles in attempts at mediation, noted the need for some territorial and diplomatic compromise on this issue, based on the validity of some of the claims of both sides.[109][110] One compromise offered by Clinton would have allowed Israel to keep some settlements in the West Bank, especially those in large blocks near the pre-1967 borders of Israel. In return, Palestinians would have received concessions of land in other parts of the country.[111]\\r\\nThe United Nations did not declare any change in the status of the territories as of the creation of the Palestinian National Authority between 1993 and 2000, although a 1999 U.N. document[103] implied that the chance for a change in that status was slim at that period.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the period between the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Second Intifada beginning in 2000, Israeli officials claimed that the term \\"occupation\\" did not accurately reflect the state of affairs in the territories. During this time, the Palestinian population in large parts of the territories had a large degree of autonomy and only limited exposure to the IDF except when seeking to move between different areas. Following the events of the Second Intifada, and in particular, Operation Defensive Shield, most territories, including Palestinian cities (Area A), are back under effective Israeli military control, so the discussion along those lines is largely moot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the summer of 2005, Israel implemented its unilateral disengagement plan; about 8500 Israeli citizens living in the Gaza Strip were forcibly removed from the territory; some received alternative homes and a sum of money. The Israel Defense Forces vacated Gaza in 2005, but invaded it again in 2006 in response to rocket attacks and the abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2010, King Abdullah of Jordan, after a meeting with the Israeli president Shimon Peres at the World Economic Forum in Davos, declared that his country does not want to rule the West Bank and that \\"the two-state solution\\" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the only viable option. If rule over the territory was to be transferred to the kingdom, it would only \\"replace Israeli military rule with Jordanian military rule... and the Palestinians want their own state.\\"[112]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2010, Brazil recognized Palestine as a state with its 1967 borders. This move was later followed by Argentina, Peru, Uruguay, Bolivia and Ecuador. This action was later criticized by Israel and the United States, who labelled it \\"counterproductive\\".[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) estimated Palestinians at mid year 2009 as 10.7 million persons as follows: 3.9 million in the Palestinian Territory (36.6%), 1.2 million (11.5%) in Israel; 5.0 million in Arab countries (46.2%), 0.6 million in foreign countries (5.7%).[114]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Guardian (2008) the Palestinian territories have one of the fastest growing populations in the world, with numbers surging 30% in the past decade (2008). There were 3.76 million Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, up from 2.89 million ten years earlier.[115]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the U.S. Census, population growth from 1990 to 2008 in Gaza and the West Bank was 106%, from 1.9 million (1990) to 3.9 million persons.[116]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the UN (2010), the Palestinian population was 4.4 million.[117] According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) population density in 2009 was 654 capita/km2, of which 433 capita/km2 in the West Bank including Jerusalem and 4,073 capita/km2 in Gaza Strip.[118] In mid-2009, the share of population less than 15 years was 41.9% and above 65 years 3%.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe overwhelming majority of Palestinians are Muslims. Almost the entire Palestinian Muslim population is Sunni, although few dozen converts to Ahmadiyya Islam resides in West Bank.[127] According to Palestinian constitution, article 4: \\"Islam is the official religion of Palestine. Respect for the sanctity of all other divine religions shall be maintained\\".[128]  Christians constitute about 1ÿ2% of population of Palestinian territories.[129] The Christian population of Gaza is estimated at about 3,000[130] There are also about 370 Samaritans in West Bank village of  Kiryat Luza on Mount Gerizim who hold both Palestinian and Israeli citizenship.[131] The number of Jewish settlers in West Bank is estimated at 341 000 as of the end of 2012 and over 200 000 in East Jerusalem.[132]\\r\\n\\r\\nArabic is the official language within the Palestinian Authority.[133] Palestinian Arabic is the vernacular. Hebrew and English are widely spoken. 16.1% of the population speaks Hebrew as their native language and Hebrew is also a second or third language to many other Palestinians.[134][135]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PCBS estimated that about 564,000 Israeli settlers lived in the West Bank in 2012. Some 203,000 of them were settled in East Jerusalem (Area J1 of the Jerusalem Governorate) and 346,000 in the remaining West Bank.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nConsistent with its policy of Jerusalem as a united and indivisible capital of Israel, Israel does not publish exact figures of the number of settlers in East Jerusalem. Rather the figures of Israelis in Judea and Samaria District are given. Independently from the political composition of its subsequent governments, the number of settlers in the West Bank has grown rapidly and in a relatively straight line since 1967 (see graphics). The Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics counted about 341,000 settlers end 2012 in the Judea and Samaria District, which does not include Jerusalem.[138]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution of the League of Arab States says the existence and independence of Palestine cannot be questioned de jure even though the outward signs of this independence have remained veiled as a result of force majeure.[139] The League supervised the Egyptian trusteeship of the Palestinian government in Gaza after the termination of the British Mandate and secured assurances from Jordan that the 1950 Act of Union was \\"without prejudice to the final settlement\\".[140][141]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1988 declaration, the PNC empowered its central council to form a government-in-exile when appropriate, and called upon its executive committee to perform the duties of the government-in-exile until its establishment.[142]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the terms of the Oslo Accords signed between Israel and the PLO, the latter assumed control over the Jericho area of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 17 May 1994. On 28 September 1995, following the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces withdrew from the West Bank towns of Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho, Jenin, Tulkarem, Qalqilya and Bethlehem. In December 1995, the PLO also assumed responsibility for civil administration in 17 areas in Hebron.[143] While the PLO assumed these responsibilities as a result of Oslo, a new temporary interim administrative body was set up as a result of the Accords to carry out these functions on the ground: the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).\\r\\n\\r\\nAn analysis outlining the relationship between the PLO, the PNA (PA), Palestine and Israel in light of the interim arrangements set out in the Oslo Accords begins by stating that, \\"Palestine may best be described as a transitional association between the PA and the PLO.\\" It goes on to explain that this transitional association accords the PA responsibility for local government and the PLO responsibility for representation of the Palestinian people in the international arena, while prohibiting it from concluding international agreements that affect the status of the occupied territories. This situation is said to be accepted by the Palestinian population insofar as it is viewed as a temporary arrangement.[144]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the Battle of Gaza (2007), the two separate territories, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, are divided into a Hamas leadership in the Gaza Strip and a Fatah civil leadership in the autonomous areas of the West Bank. Each sees itself as the administrator of all Palestinian Territories and does not acknowledge the other one as the official government of the territories. The Palestinian Territories have therefore de facto split into two entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the signing of the Oslo Accords, the Palestinian territories were divided 16 governorates under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority. Since 2007 there are two governments claiming to be the legitimate government of the Palestinian National Authority, one based in the West Bank and one based in the Gaza Strip.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oslo II Accord created three temporary distinct administrative divisions in the Palestinian territories, the Areas A, B and C, until a final status accord would be established. The areas are not contiguous, but rather fragmented depending on the different population areas as well as Israeli military requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1922, after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire that ruled Greater Syria for four centuries (1517ÿ1917), the British Mandate for Palestine was established. Large-scale Jewish immigration from abroad, mainly from Eastern Europe took place during the British Mandate, though Jewish immigration started during the Ottoman period.[150][151] The future of Palestine was hotly disputed between Arabs and Jews. In 1947, the total Jewish ownership of land in Palestine was 1,850,000 dunams or 1,850 square kilometres (714?sq?mi), which is 7.04% of the total land of Palestine.[152] Public property or \\"crown lands\\", the bulk of which was in the Negev, belonging to the government of Palestine may have made up as much as 70% of the total land; with the Arabs, Christians and others owning the rest.[153]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1947 United Nations Partition Plan proposed a division of Mandate Palestine between an Arab and a Jewish state, with Jerusalem and the surrounding area to be a corpus separatum under a special international regime. The regions allotted to the proposed Arab state included what became the Gaza Strip, and almost all of what became the West Bank, as well as other areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Partition Plan was passed by the UN General Assembly in November 1947. The Partition Plan was accepted by the Jewish leadership, but rejected by the Arab leaders. The Arab League threatened to take military measures to prevent the partition of Palestine and to ensure the national rights of the Palestinian Arab population. One day before the expiration of the British Mandate for Palestine, on 14 May 1948, Israel declared its independence within the borders of the Jewish State set out in the Partition Plan. US President Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel de facto the following day. The Arab countries declared war on the newly formed State of Israel heralding the start of the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War.[citation needed] Arab countries announced \\"an intervention in Palestine to restore law and order\\", heralding the start of the 1948 Palestine War.[154][non-primary source needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, which Palestinians call the Nakba, the 1949 Armistice Agreements established the separation lines between the combatants, leaving Israel in control of some of the areas designated for the Arab state under the Partition Plan, Transjordan in control of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Egypt in control of the Gaza Strip and Syria in control of the Himmah Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1950, Jordan annexed the West Bank. Only the United Kingdom formally recognized the annexation of the West Bank, excluding the case of East Jerusalem which was de facto recognized.[155] In the Gaza Strip the Arab League formed the All-Palestine Government, which operated under Egypt occupation.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle 24 of the Palestinian National Covenant of 1964, which established the Palestine Liberation Organization,[156] stated: \\"This Organization does not exercise any territorial sovereignty over the West Bank in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, on the Gaza Strip or in the Himmah Area\\" (i.e. the areas of the former Mandate Palestine controlled by Jordan, Egypt and Syria, respectively).\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael captured both territories in the 1967 Six-Day War, as well as other territory belonging to Egypt and Syria. Since then, these territories have been designated Israeli-occupied territories. Immediately after the war, on 19 June 1967, the Israeli government offered to return the Golan Heights to Syria, the Sinai to Egypt and most of the West Bank to Jordan in exchange for peace. At the Khartoum Summit in September, the Arab parties responded to this overture by declaring \\"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel and no negotiations with Israel.\\"[157]\\r\\n\\r\\nUN Security Council Resolution 242 introduced the \\"Land for Peace\\" formula for normalizing relations between Israel and its neighbors. This formula was used when Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in 1979 in exchange for a peace treaty. While that treaty mentioned a \\"linkage\\" between Israeli-Egyptian peace and Palestinian autonomy, the formerly Egyptian-occupied territory in Gaza was excluded from the agreement, and remained under Israeli control.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oslo Accords of the early 1990s between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority. This was an interim organization created to administer a limited form of Palestinian self-governance in the territories for a period of five years during which final-status negotiations would take place. The Palestinian Authority carried civil responsibility in some rural areas, as well as security responsibility in the major cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Although the five-year interim period expired in 1999, the final status agreement has yet to be concluded despite attempts such as the 2000 Camp David Summit, the Taba summit, and the unofficial Geneva Accords.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 3153N 3512E? / ?31.883N 35.200E? / 31.883; 35.200","input":"What is the west bank and gaza strip?"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},B={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",B,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):y("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(M,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/13.md","filePath":"qapage/13.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/13.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,G as default};
