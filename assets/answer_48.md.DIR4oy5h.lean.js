They are intended to increase rendering speed and reduce aliasing artifacts . A high - resolution mipmap image is used for high - density samples , such as for objects close to the camera . Lower - resolution images are used as the object appears farther away . This is a more efficient way of downfiltering ( minifying ) a texture than sampling all texels in the original texture that would contribute to a screen pixel ; it is faster to take a constant number of samples from the appropriately downfiltered textures . Mipmaps are widely used in 3D computer games , flight simulators , other 3D imaging systems for texture filtering and 2D as well as 3D GIS software . Their use is known as mipmapping . The letters \`\` MIP '' in the name are an acronym of the Latin phrase multum in parvo , meaning \`\` much in little '' . Since mipmaps , by definition , are pre-allocated , additional storage space is required to take advantage of them . They are also related to wavelet compression .

The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body , then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events . Nervous tissue first arose in wormlike organisms about 550 to 600 million years ago . In vertebrates it consists of two main parts , the central nervous system ( CNS ) and the peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) . The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord . The PNS consists mainly of nerves , which are enclosed bundles of the long fibers or axons , that connect the CNS to every other part of the body . Nerves that transmit signals from the brain are called motor or efferent nerves , while those nerves that transmit information from the body to the CNS are called sensory or afferent . Spinal nerves serve both functions and are called mixed nerves . The PNS is divided into three separate subsystems , the somatic , autonomic , and enteric nervous systems . Somatic nerves mediate voluntary movement . The autonomic nervous system is further subdivided into the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems . The sympathetic nervous system is activated in cases of emergencies to mobilize energy , while the parasympathetic nervous system is activated when organisms are in a relaxed state . The enteric nervous system functions to control the gastrointestinal system . Both autonomic and enteric nervous systems function involuntarily .

For example , someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \`\` always prepared '' rather than \`\` messy '' . This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments . This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor , there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union .

Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure . The largest low - pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale ( the synoptic scale ) . Warm - core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale . Mesocyclones , tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale . Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low , and can pinch off from the base of the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere . Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets , such as Mars and Neptune . Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification . Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones . These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies . Later in their life cycle , extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems . A cyclone 's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream ."},{"query":"show me a map of west chester pennsylvania","short_answer":"","abstract":"West Chester is a borough and the county seat of Chester County , Pennsylvania , in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania .

Scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work , regardless of the theoretical difficulties . If as Linnaeus thought , species were fixed , there would be no problem , but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually , and to grade into one another . A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring , typically by sexual reproduction . While this definition is often adequate , when looked at more closely it is problematic . For example , with hybridisation , in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies , or in a ring species , the boundaries between closely related species become unclear . Among organisms that reproduce only asexually , the concept of a reproductive species breaks down , and each clone is potentially a microspecies . Problems also arise when dealing with fossils , since reproduction can not be examined ; the concept of the chronospecies is therefore used in palaeontology . Other ways of defining species include their karyotype , DNA sequence , morphology , behaviour or ecological niche ."},{"query":"what is the most spoken language in the world","short_answer":"","abstract":"This article ranks human languages by their number of native speakers ."},{"query":"when do new episodes of blue bloods air","short_answer":"December 1 , 2017|December 8 , 2017","abstract":"Blue Bloods is an American police procedural television series created by Robin Green and Mitchell Burgess .

The Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation set up by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) defines safe drinking water as \`\` water with microbial , chemical and physical characteristics that meets WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality . '' Hydrologists generally assess water scarcity by looking at a population - to - water equation that treats 1,700 cubic meters per person as the national threshold for meeting water requirements for agricultural and industrial production , energy , and the environment .

If the rate of gene flow is high enough , then two populations are considered to have equivalent genetic diversity and therefore effectively be a single population . It has been shown that it takes only \`\` One migrant per generation '' to prevent populations from diverging due to drift . Gene flow is an important mechanism for transferring genetic diversity among populations . Migrants change the distribution of genetic diversity within the populations , by modifying the allele frequencies ( the proportion of members carrying a particular variant of a gene ) . High rates of gene flow can reduce the genetic differentiation between the two groups , increasing homogeneity . For this reason , gene flow has been thought to constrain speciation by combining the gene pools of the groups , thus preventing the development of differences in genetic variation that would have led to full speciation . In some cases migration may also result in the addition of novel genetic variants to the gene pool of a species or population ."},{"query":"who does sansa marry on game of thrones","short_answer":"Tyrion Lannister","abstract":"Sansa Stark is a fictional character created by American author George R.R.

Stress is the body 's method of reacting to a challenge . Stimuli that alter an organism 's environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body . The autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( HPA ) axis are two major systems that respond to stress . The sympathoadrenal medullary ( SAM ) axis may activate the fight or flight response through the sympathetic nervous system , which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaption to stress , while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis . The second major physiological stress , the HPA axis regulates the release of cortisol , which influences many bodily functions such as metabolic , psychological and immunological functions . The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by a wide variety of brain regions , including the limbic system , prefrontal cortex , amygdala , hypothalamus , and stria terminalis . Through these mechanisms , stress can alter memory functions , reward , immune function , metabolism and susceptibility to diseases . Definitions of stress differ ; however , one system proposed by Elliot and Eisdorfer suggests five types of stress . The five types of stress are labeled \`\` acute time limited stressors '' , \`\` brief naturalistic stressors '' , \`\` stressful event sequence '' , \`\` chronic stressors '' , and \`\` distant stressors '' . Acute time limited stressors involve short term challenges , while , on the other hand , brief naturalistic stressors involve an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging . Stressful event sequences are a stressor that occur , and continue to yield stress into the immediate future . Chronic stressors involve exposure to a long - term stressor and a distant stressor is a stressor that is n't immediate ."},{"query":"who sang ill never fall in love again","short_answer":"","abstract":"\`\` I 'll Never Fall in Love Again '' is a popular song by composer Burt Bacharach and lyricist Hal David that was written for the 1968 musical Promises , Promises .

Molecular excitations , either originating directly from sunlight or transferred as excitation energy via light - harvesting antenna systems , give rise to electron transfer reactions along the path of a series of protein - bound co-factors . These co-factors are light - absorbing molecules ( also named chromophores or pigments ) such as chlorophyll and phaeophytin , as well as quinones . The energy of the photon is used to excite an electron of a pigment . The free energy created is then used to reduce a chain of nearby electron acceptors , which have subsequently higher redox - potentials . These electron transfer steps are the initial phase of a series of energy conversion reactions , ultimately resulting in the conversion of the energy of photons to the storage of that energy by the production of chemical bonds ."},{"query":"what is the cut off age for draft","short_answer":"","abstract":"The Selective Service System is an independent agency of the United States government that maintains information on those potentially subject to military conscription .

Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War . This principle was extended to public facilities and transportation , including segregated cars on interstate trains and , later , buses .

In bacteria , which lack a cell nucleus , the cell cycle is divided into the B , C , and D periods . The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication . DNA replication occurs during the C period . The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells . In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells . To ensure the proper division of the cell , there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints ."},{"query":"where did the oral tradition of robin hood originate","short_answer":"","abstract":"Robin Hood is a heroic outlaw in English folklore who , according to legend , was a highly skilled archer and swordsman .

The song tells the story of an old woman who swallowed increasingly large animals , each to catch the previously swallowed animal . There are many variations of phrasing in the lyrics , especially for the description of swallowing each animal . The spider and fly are described in each verse , but the other animals are only described when they are introduced starting with the bird . The absurdity stems from the increasingly improbable solutions that only worsen the initial problem and are more likely to cause the woman 's death : the logic of swallowing of even more animals of preposterous sizes without dying , contrasted with the expected , matter - of - fact recounting of her death from swallowing an animal larger than herself , when in fact the swallowing of any animal as a solution was absurd . This song for children appeals to their initial logic that a fly can be swallowed by an old lady . A spider would also be seen as logical and physically possible . As you get to the bird , it slowly becomes clear for the child that it 's part of an imaginary scenario leading to a whole horse being swallowed . The last sentence brings the child back to a rational understanding that the old lady is in fact dead of course as physically this is impossible making place for children 's amusement and laughter ."},{"query":"who died in harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 movie","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"meaning of joseph's coat of many colours","short_answer":"","abstract":"In the Hebrew Bible , the coat of many colors ( Hebrew : ◊õ÷∞÷º◊™÷π◊†÷∂◊™ ◊§÷∑÷º◊°÷¥÷º◊ô◊ù ‚Ä¨ ‚Äé k…ô·πØ≈çne·πØ pass√Æm ) is the name for the garment that Joseph owned , which was given to him by his father , Jacob ."},{"query":"when does a baby turn one years old","short_answer":"","abstract":"East Asian age reckoning is a concept and practice that originated in China and is widely used by other cultures in East Asia .

The main function of the SR is to store calcium ions ( Ca ) . Calcium ion levels are kept relatively constant , with the concentration of calcium ions within a cell being 100,000 times smaller than the concentration of calcium ions outside the cell . This means that small increases in calcium ions within the cell are easily detected and can bring about important cellular changes ( the calcium is said to be a second messenger ; see calcium in biology for more details ) . Calcium is used to make calcium carbonate ( found in chalk ) and calcium phosphate , two compounds that the body uses to make teeth and bones . This means that too much calcium within the cells can lead to hardening ( calcification ) of certain intracellular structures , including the mitochondria , leading to cell death . Therefore , it is vital that calcium ion levels are controlled tightly , and can be released into the cell when necessary and then removed from the cell ."},{"query":"what are some weaknesses a person could have","short_answer":"","abstract":"Strengths and weaknesses generally refer to a person 's character ."},{"query":"when does the next book of trials of apollo come out","short_answer":"Fall 2019","abstract":"The Trials of Apollo is a pentalogy of fantasy adventure and mythological fiction novels written by American author Rick Riordan that collectively form a sequel to the Heroes of Olympus series .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"when was who let the dogs out made","short_answer":"","abstract":""},{"query":"which curve best describes survivorship that is independent of age","short_answer":"","abstract":"A survivorship curve is a graph showing the number or proportion of individuals surviving to each age for a given species or group ( e.g. males or females ) .

A rift valley is formed on a divergent plate boundary , a crustal extension , a spreading apart of the surface , which is subsequently further deepened by the forces of erosion . When the tensional forces were strong enough to cause the plate to split apart , a center block dropped between the two blocks at its flanks , forming a graben . The drop of the center creates the nearly parallel steeply dipping walls of a rift valley when it is new . That feature is the beginning of the rift valley , but as the process continues , the valley widens , until it becomes a large basin that fills with sediment from the rift walls and the surrounding area . One of the best known examples of this process is the East African Rift . On Earth , rifts can occur at all elevations , from the sea floor to plateaus and mountain ranges in continental crust or in oceanic crust . They are often associated with a number of adjoining subsidiary or co-extensive valleys , which are typically considered part of the principal rift valley geologically ."},{"query":"who was the first nigerian musician that won a prize and the year","short_answer":"","abstract":"The following is a list of Grammy Awards winners and nominees from Nigeria :"},{"query":"how did jimmy's brother on better call saul","short_answer":"","abstract":"Charles Lindbergh \`\` Chuck '' McGill , Jr. , is a fictional character who appears in the crime drama television series Better Call Saul , a spin - off prequel of Breaking Bad .
