The United States Constitution has never specified the process ; political parties have developed their own procedures over time . Some states hold only primary elections , some hold only caucuses , and others use a combination of both . These primaries and caucuses are staggered , generally beginning in either late - January or early - February , and ending about mid-June before the general election in November . State and local governments run the primary elections , while caucuses are private events that are directly run by the political parties themselves . A state 's primary election or caucus is usually an indirect election : instead of voters directly selecting a particular person running for President , they determine the number of delegates each party 's national convention will receive from their respective state . These delegates then in turn select their party 's presidential nominee . The first state in the union to hold its presidential primary was New Hampshire in 1920 ."},{"query":"when did h & m open in the us","short_answer":"March 31 , 2000","abstract":"Hennes & Mauritz AB ( Swedish pronunciation : ( 2hoː. ɛm ; 2hɛnːɛs ɔ ˈma. ʊrɪts ) ; H&M ) is a Swedish multinational clothing - retail company known for its fast - fashion clothing for men , women , teenagers and children .

The ability of an organism or organ to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity . When a stimulus is applied to a sensory receptor , it normally elicits or influences a reflex via stimulus transduction . These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body , as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye , as well as from inside the body , as in chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors . An internal stimulus is often the first component of a homeostatic control system . External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body , as in the fight - or - flight response . In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability , its level must exceed the absolute threshold ; if a signal does reach threshold , the information is transmitted to the central nervous system ( CNS ) , where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made . Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond , it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not ."},{"query":"when did the pilgrims set sail for america","short_answer":"1620","abstract":"The Mayflower was an English ship that famously transported the first English Puritans , known today as the Pilgrims , from Plymouth , England to the New World in 1620 .

With agenda setting being a social science theory , it also attempts to make predictions . That is , if a news item is covered frequently and prominently , the audience will regard the issue as more important . Agenda - setting theory was formally developed by Max McCombs and Donald Shaw in a study on the 1968 American presidential election . In the 1968 \`\` Chapel Hill study '' , McCombs and Shaw demonstrated a strong correlation coefficient ( r > . 9 ) between what 100 residents of Chapel Hill , North Carolina thought was the most important election issue and what the local and national news media reported was the most important issue . By comparing the salience of issues in news content with the public 's perceptions of the most important election issue , McCombs and Shaw were able to determine the degree to which the media determines public opinion . Since the 1968 study , published in a 1972 edition of Public Opinion Quarterly , more than 400 studies have been published on the agenda - setting function of the mass media , and the theory continues to be regarded as relevant . Studies have shown that what the media decides to expose in certain countries correlates with their views on things such as politics , economy and culture . Countries that tend to have more political power are more likely to receive media exposure . Financial resources , technologies , foreign trade and money spent on the military can be some of the main factors that explain coverage inequality ."},{"query":"when is the next simpsons episode coming out","short_answer":"March 11 , 2018","abstract":"The twenty - ninth season of the animated television series The Simpsons premiered on Fox in the United States on October 1 , 2017 .

In nature complementarity is the base principle of DNA replication and transcription as it is a property shared between two DNA or RNA sequences , such that when they are aligned antiparallel to each other , the nucleotide bases at each position in the sequences will be complementary , much like looking in the mirror and seeing the reverse of things . This complementary base pairing allows cells to copy information from one generation to another and even find and repair damage to the information stored in the sequences . The degree of complementarity between two nucleic acid strands may vary , from complete complementarity ( each nucleotide is across from its opposite ) to no complementarity ( each nucleotide is not across from its opposite ) and determines the stability of the sequences to be together . Furthermore , various DNA repair functions as well as regulatory functions are based on base pair complementarity . In biotechnology , the principle of base pair complementarity allows the generation of DNA hybrids between RNA and DNA , and opens the door to modern tools such as cDNA libraries . While most complementarity is seen between two separate strings of DNA or RNA , it is also possible for a sequence to have internal complementarity resulting in the sequence binding to itself in a folded configuration ."},{"query":"who plays gus the pilot on modern family","short_answer":"","abstract":"The pilot episode of the television series Modern Family , written by Steven Levitan and Christopher Lloyd and directed by Jason Winer , premiered on ABC in the United States on September 23 , 2009 .

The historical ties between the two countries are long and complex , including conquest , wars , and alliances at various points in history . The Roman era saw both areas , except Scotland and Northern Ireland , conquered by Rome , whose fortifications exist in both countries to this day , and whose writing system introduced a common alphabet to both areas ; however , the language barrier remained . The Norman conquest of England in 1066 decisively shaped English history , as well as the English language . In the medieval period , the countries were often bitter enemies , with both nations ' monarchs claiming control over France . The Hundred Years ' War stretched from 1337 to 1453 resulting in French victory . Britain and France fought a series of five major wars , culminating in the Coalition victory over Napoleon in 1815 . After that there were some tensions , but peace generally prevailed and as the 19th century progressed , the relationship became better . Closer ties between the two began with the 1904 Entente Cordiale , particularly via the alliances in World War I and World War II , wherein both countries fought against Germany , and in the latter conflict British armies helped to liberate occupied France from the Nazis . Both nations opposed the Soviet Union during the Cold War and were founding members of NATO , the western military alliance led by the United States . In recent years the two countries have experienced a quite close relationship , especially on defence and foreign policy issues ; the two countries tend , however , to disagree on a range of other matters , most notably the European Union . France and Britain are often still referred to as \`\` historic rivals '' or with emphasis on the perceived ever - lasting competition that still opposes the two countries ."},{"query":"who was expected to win the battle of puebla","short_answer":"French arms","abstract":"Scene recreated by Francisco P.

Initially , Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe , which consisted only of those planets visible with the naked eye and an outlying sphere of fixed stars . After the acceptance of the heliocentric model in the 17th century , observations by William Herschel and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast , disc - shaped galaxy of stars . By the 20th century , observations of spiral nebulae revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an expanding universe , grouped into clusters and superclusters . By the end of the 20th century , the overall structure of the visible universe was becoming clearer , with superclusters forming into a vast web of filaments and voids . Superclusters , filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe . At still larger scales ( over 1000 megaparsecs ) the Universe becomes homogeneous meaning that all its parts have on average the same density , composition and structure ."},{"query":"who are the members of three days grace","short_answer":"Brad Walst|Neil Sanderson|Barry Stock|Matt Walst","abstract":"Three Days Grace is a Canadian rock band formed in Norwood , Ontario in 1997 .

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube ( CRT ) television sets and video displays and are usually less than 10 centimetres ( 3.9 in ) thick . Flat - panel displays can be divided into two display device categories : volatile and static . Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state ( e.g. , liquid - crystal displays ( LCD ) ) . A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power . Static flat - panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable ( e.g. , e-book reader tablets from Sony ) , and as such , flat - panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off . As of 2016 , flat - panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays . In many 2010 - era applications , specifically small portable devices such as laptops , mobile phones , smartphones , digital cameras , camcorders , point - and - shoot cameras , and pocket video cameras , any display disadvantages of flat - panels ( as compared with CRTs ) are made up for by portability advantages ( thinness and lightweightness ) ."},{"query":"are king kong and godzilla in the same universe","short_answer":"","abstract":"The MonsterVerse is an American media franchise and shared fictional universe that is centered on a series of monster films featuring Godzilla and King Kong , produced by Legendary Entertainment and co-produced and distributed by Warner Bros .

Another name for food web is consumer - resource system . Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels : 1 ) the autotrophs , and 2 ) the heterotrophs . To maintain their bodies , grow , develop , and to reproduce , autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances , including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide . These chemical reactions require energy , which mainly comes from the Sun and largely by photosynthesis , although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs . A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere , to mixotrophs ( such as carnivorous plants ) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere , and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter . The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways , such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs . The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange . There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory , carnivory , scavenging and parasitism . Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs , such as sugars , provides energy . Autotrophs and heterotrophs come in all sizes , from microscopic to many tonnes - from cyanobacteria to giant redwoods , and from viruses and bdellovibrio to blue whales ."},{"query":"who won the gold medal in couples ice dancing","short_answer":"","abstract":"Torvill and Dean ( Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean ) are British ice dancers and former British , European , Olympic and World champions .

Much of the material from the Dragon Ball Z anime that was not featured in the Dragon Ball manga has been left out in Kai , which reduced the total episode count from 291 to 167 .

England and Wales ( with the exception of the City of London , which was outside the scope of the Act ) were divided into 60 circuits , with a total of 491 county courts within these circuits . The then Lord Chancellor , Lord Cottenham , wanted everyone to be within seven miles of a court , and the final scheme came close to that aim . One county court judge was appointed to each circuit , assisted by one or more registrars with some limited judicial powers , and would travel between the courts in his area as necessary , sitting in each court at least once a month . Few permanent courts were needed initially , given the infrequency of court hearings , and temporary accommodation such as a town hall would often be used where there was no existing courthouse for use . In some places , a building is now shared with the local Crown Court ( as at Maidstone Combined Court Centre , for example ) , Family Court , or magistrates ' court . The judicial business of the county courts is now carried out by circuit judges ( a term introduced by the Courts Act 1971 ) and district judges ( as the post of registrar was renamed by section 74 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 ) .
