It was proposed by Ernst Munch , a German plant physiologist in 1930 . A high concentration of organic substances , particularly sugar , inside cells of the phloem at a source , such as a leaf , creates a diffusion gradient ( osmotic gradient ) that draws water into the cells from the adjacent xylem . This creates turgor pressure , also known as hydrostatic pressure , in the phloem . Movement of phloem sap occurs by bulk flow ( mass flow ) from sugar sources to sugar sinks . The movement in phloem is bidirectional , whereas , in xylem cells , it is unidirectional ( upward ) . Because of this multi-directional flow , coupled with the fact that sap can not move with ease between adjacent sieve - tubes , it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve - tubes to be flowing in opposite directions ."},{"query":"what genre is the book house of robots","short_answer":"","abstract":"I , Robot is a fixup of science fiction short stories or essay by American writer Isaac Asimov .

Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain 's fine - fibered dendritic webs , which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses . These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns in which memory is encoded naturally , and the waves may be analyzed by a Fourier transform . Gabor , Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram , which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform . In a hologram , any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information . In this theory , a piece of a long - term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network . This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness , including the fast associative memory that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the non-locality of memory storage ( a specific memory is not stored in a specific location , i.e. a certain neuron ) ."},{"query":"when has the popular vote been different than the electoral vote","short_answer":"","abstract":"There have been five United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote including the 1824 election , which was the first U.S. presidential election where the popular vote was recorded .

Diatoms are unicellular , although they can form colonies in the shape of filaments or ribbons ( e.g. Fragilaria ) , fans ( e.g. Meridion ) , zigzags ( e.g. Tabellaria ) , or stars ( e.g. Asterionella ) . The first diatom formally described in scientific literature , the colonial Bacillaria paradoxa , was found in 1783 by Danish naturalist Otto Friedrich Müller . Diatoms are producers within the food chain . A unique feature of diatom cells is that they are enclosed within a cell wall made of silica ( hydrated silicon dioxide ) called a frustule . These frustules show a wide diversity in form , but are usually almost bilaterally symmetrical , hence the group name . The symmetry is not perfect since one of the valves is slightly larger than the other , allowing one valve to fit inside the edge of the other . These shells are used by humans as diatomaceous earth , also known as diatomite . Fossil evidence suggests that they originated during , or before , the early Jurassic period . Only male gametes of centric diatoms are capable of movement by means of flagella .

It is also less commonly known as a balanced parliament or a legislature under no overall control . If the legislature is bicameral , and the government is responsible only to the lower house , then \`\` hung parliament '' is used only with respect to that chamber . It is the objective of parliamentary systems for the parliament to be able to form a stable government , preferably one that lasts until the next election . This requires the government to be able to muster up sufficient votes in parliament to pass important legislation , especially the government 's budget . It also needs sufficient votes to defeat votes of no - confidence in the government . If the state of the parliament is such that a majority government can not be formed , the government may be referred to as a \`\` minority government '' . The term hung parliament is used mainly in systems with two parties or two party blocs . Most general elections in such a system will result in one or other party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government ; a \`\` hung parliament '' is an exception to this pattern , and may by some be considered anomalous or undesirable , and by others ideal as it blocks the dangers of absolute power . One or both main parties may seek to form a coalition government with smaller third parties , or a minority government relying on confidence and supply support from third parties or independents .
