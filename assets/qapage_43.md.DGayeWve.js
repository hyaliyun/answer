He was formerly editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics,[2] and later its publisher[3] and chairman[4] before leaving the company to become its chairman emeritus, as well as a member of the editorial board.[5]\\r\\nIn collaboration with several artists, including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he co-created fictional characters including Spider-Man, the Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Black Panther, the X-Men, and, with the addition of co-writer Larry Lieber, the characters Ant-Man, Iron Man and Thor. In addition, he challenged the comics industry's censorship organization, the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to it updating its policies. Lee subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a publishing house to a large multimedia corporation.\\r\\nHe was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. Lee received a National Medal of Arts in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Martin Lieber was born on December 28, 1922 in Manhattan, New York City,[6] in the apartment of his Romanian-born Jewish immigrant parents, Celia (ne Solomon) and Jack Lieber, at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in Manhattan.[7][8] His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression,[7] and the family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue,[9] in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee has one younger brother named Larry Lieber.[10] He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles.[11] By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee has described it as \\"a third-floor apartment facing out back\\". Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.[10]\\r\\nLee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.[12] In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of one day writing the \\"Great American Novel\\".[13] He has said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center;[14] delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway;[15] and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper.[16] He graduated from high school early, aged 16? in 1939, and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.[17]\\r\\nWith the help of his uncle Robbie Solomon,[18] Lee became an assistant in 1939 at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman's company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean[19] was Goodman's wife, was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon.[n 1]\\r\\nHis duties were prosaic at first. \\"In those days [the artists] dipped the pen in ink, [so] I had to make sure the inkwells were filled\\", Lee recalled in 2009. \\"I went down and got them their lunch, I did proofreading, I erased the pencils from the finished pages for them\\".[21] Marshaling his childhood ambition to be a writer, young Stanley Lieber made his comic-book debut with the text filler \\"Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge\\" in Captain America Comics #3 (cover-dated May 1941), using the pseudonym Stan Lee,[22] which years later he would adopt as his legal name.[citation needed] Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work. This initial story also introduced Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss.[23]:11\\r\\nHe graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, \\"'Headline' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent\\", two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (August 1941). Other characters he co-created during this period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books include Jack Frost, debuting in U.S.A. Comics #1 (August 1941), and Father Time, debuting in Captain America Comics #6 (August 1941).[23]:12ÿ13\\r\\nWhen Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941, following a dispute with Goodman, the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor.[23]:14 [24] The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher.[2][25]\\r\\nLee entered the United States Army in early 1942 and served in the US in the Signal Corps, repairing telegraph poles and other communications equipment.[26] He was later transferred to the Training Film Division, where he worked writing manuals, training films, and slogans, and occasionally cartooning.[27] His military classification, he says, was \\"playwright\\"; he adds that only nine men in the US Army were given that title.[28] Vincent Fago, editor of Timely's \\"animation comics\\" section, which put out humor and funny animal comics, filled in until Lee returned from his World War II military service in 1945.\\r\\nIn the mid-1950s, by which time the company was now generally known as Atlas Comics, Lee wrote stories in a variety of genres including romance, Westerns, humor, science fiction, medieval adventure, horror and suspense. In the 1950s, Lee teamed up with his comic book colleague Dan DeCarlo to produce the syndicated newspaper strip, My Friend Irma, based on the radio comedy starring Marie Wilson.[29] By the end of the decade, Lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field.[30][31]\\r\\nIn the late 1950s, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz revived the superhero archetype and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the Flash, and later with super-team the Justice League of America. In response, publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to come up with a new superhero team. Lee's wife suggested him to experiment with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose.[30][31]\\r\\nLee acted on that advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for preteens. Before this, most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious, lasting problems.[32] Lee introduced complex, naturalistic characters[33] who could have bad tempers, fits of melancholy, and vanity; they bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, got bored or even were sometimes physically ill.\\r\\nThe first superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby created together was the Fantastic Four, based on previous Kirby superhero team Challengers of the Unknown published by DC Comics[34] The team's immediate popularity[35] led Lee and Marvel's illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. Again working with Kirby, Lee co-created the Hulk,[36] Thor,[37] Iron Man,[38] and the X-Men;[39] with Bill Everett, Daredevil;[40] and with Steve Ditko, Doctor Strange[41] and Marvel's most successful character, Spider-Man,[42] all of whom lived in a thoroughly shared universe.[43] Lee and Kirby gathered several of their newly created characters together into the team title The Avengers[44] and would revive characters from the 1940s such as the Sub-Mariner[45] and Captain America.[46]\\r\\nComics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that in the 1960s:\\r\\nDC was the equivalent of the big Hollywood studios: After the brilliance of DC's reinvention of the superhero ... in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it had run into a creative drought by the decade's end. There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn't just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the French New Wave.... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further.[47]\\r\\nLee's revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.[48] He introduced the practice of regularly including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the Bullpen Bulletins page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style. Lee has said that his goal was for fans to think of the comics creators as friends, and considered it a mark of his success on this front that, at a time when letters to other comics publishers were typically addressed \\"Dear Editor\\", letters to Marvel addressed the creators by first name (e.g. \\"Dear Stan and Jack\\").[26] By 1967, the brand was well-enough ensconced in popular culture that a March 3 WBAI radio program with Lee and Kirby as guests was titled \\"Will Success Spoil Spiderman\\" [sic].[49]\\r\\nThroughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed and edited most of Marvel's series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called \\"Stan's Soapbox\\", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark motto, \\"Excelsior!\\" (which is also the New York state motto). To maintain his workload and meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the \\"Marvel Method\\". Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the word balloons and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon. Lee recorded messages to the newly formed Merry Marvel Marching Society fan club in 1965.[50]\\r\\nFollowing Ditko's departure from Marvel in 1966, John Romita Sr. became Lee's collaborator on The Amazing Spider-Man. Within a year, it overtook Fantastic Four to become the company's top seller.[51] Lee and Romita's stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man's adventures.[52] The stories became more topical, addressing issues such as the Vietnam War,[53] political elections,[54] and student activism.[55] Robbie Robertson, introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #51 (August 1967) was one of the first African-American characters in comics to play a serious supporting role.[56] In the Fantastic Four series, the lengthy run by Lee and Kirby produced many acclaimed storylines as well as characters that have become central to Marvel, including the Inhumans[57][58] and the Black Panther,[59] an African king who would be mainstream comics' first black superhero.[60]\\r\\nThe story frequently cited as Lee and Kirby's finest achievement[61][62] is the three-part \\"Galactus Trilogy\\" that began in Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966), chronicling the arrival of Galactus, a cosmic giant who wanted to devour the planet, and his herald, the Silver Surfer.[63][64] Fantastic Four #48 was chosen as #24 in the 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time poll of Marvel's readers in 2001. Editor Robert Greenberger wrote in his introduction to the story that \\"As the fourth year of the Fantastic Four came to a close, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby seemed to be only warming up. In retrospect, it was perhaps the most fertile period of any monthly title during the Marvel Age.\\"[65] Comics historian Les Daniels noted that \\"[t]he mystical and metaphysical elements that took over the saga were perfectly suited to the tastes of young readers in the 1960s\\", and Lee soon discovered that the story was a favorite on college campuses.[66] Lee and artist John Buscema launched The Silver Surfer series in August 1968.[67][68]\\r\\nThe following year, Lee and Gene Colan created the Falcon, comics' first African-American superhero in Captain America #117 (September 1969).[69] Then in 1971, Lee indirectly helped reform the Comics Code.[70] The U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare had asked Lee to write a comic-book story about the dangers of drugs and Lee conceived a three-issue subplot in The Amazing Spider-Man #96ÿ98 (cover-dated MayÿJuly 1971), in which Peter Parker's best friend becomes addicted to pills. The Comics Code Authority refused to grant its seal because the stories depicted drug use; the anti-drug context was considered irrelevant. With Goodman's cooperation and confident that the original government request would give him credibility, Lee had the story published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.[71] The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.[72][73]\\r\\nLee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with racism and bigotry.[74] \\"Stan's Soapbox\\", besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of discrimination, intolerance, or prejudice.[75][76]\\r\\nIn 1972, Lee stopped writing monthly comic books to assume the role of publisher. His final issue of The Amazing Spider-Man was #110 (July 1972)[77] and his last Fantastic Four was #125 (August 1972).[78]\\r\\nIn later years, Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions. Lee and John Romita Sr. launched the Spider-Man newspaper comic strip on January 3, 1977.[79] Lee's final collaboration with Jack Kirby, The Silver Surfer: The Ultimate Cosmic Experience, was published in 1978 as part of the Marvel Fireside Books series and is considered to be Marvel's first graphic novel.[80] Lee and John Buscema produced the first issue of The Savage She-Hulk (February 1980), which introduced the female cousin of the Hulk[81] and crafted a Silver Surfer story for Epic Illustrated #1 (Spring 1980).[82] He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel's TV and movie properties. He has been an executive producer for, and has made cameo appearances in, Marvel film adaptations and other movies. He occasionally returned to comic book writing with various Silver Surfer projects including a 1982 one-shot drawn by John Byrne,[83] the Judgment Day graphic novel illustrated by John Buscema,[84] the Parable limited series drawn by French artist M?bius,[85] and The Enslavers graphic novel with Keith Pollard.[86] Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead, finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed.[87]\\r\\nPeter Paul and Lee began a new Internet-based superhero creation, production, and marketing studio, Stan Lee Media, in 1998.[88] It grew to 165 people and went public through a reverse merger structured by investment banker Stan Medley in 1999, but, near the end of 2000, investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon.[89] Stan Lee Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2001.[90] Paul was extradited to the U.S. from Brazil and pleaded guilty to violating SEC Rule 10b-5 in connection with trading of his stock in Stan Lee Media.[91][92] Lee was never implicated in the scheme. In 2001, Lee, Gill Champion, and Arthur Lieberman formed POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment to develop film, television and video game properties. Lee created the risqu animated superhero series Stripperella for Spike TV. In 2004 POW! Entertainment went public. Also that year, Lee announced a superhero program that would feature Ringo Starr, the former Beatle, as the lead character.[93][94] Additionally, in August of that year, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee's Sunday Comics,[95] a short-lived subscription service hosted by Komikwerks.com. On March 15, 2007, after Stan Lee Media had been purchased by Jim Nesfield, the company filed a lawsuit against Marvel Entertainment for $5?billion, claiming Lee had given his rights to several Marvel characters to Stan Lee Media in exchange for stock and a salary.[96] On June 9, 2007, Stan Lee Media sued Lee; his newer company, POW! Entertainment; and POW! subsidiary QED Entertainment.[97][98]\\r\\nIn 2008, Lee wrote humorous captions for the political fumetti book Stan Lee Presents Election Daze: What Are They Really Saying?.[99] In April of that year, Brighton Partners and Rainmaker Animation announced a partnership POW! to produce a CGI film series, Legion of 5.[100] Other projects by Lee announced in the late 2000s included a line of superhero comics for Virgin Comics,[101] a TV adaptation of the novel Hero,[102] a foreword to Skyscraperman by skyscraper fire-safety advocate and Spider-Man fan Dan Goodwin,[103] a partnership with Guardian Media Entertainment and The Guardian Project to create NHL superhero mascots[104] and work with the Eagle Initiative program to find new talent in the comic book field.[105]\\r\\nIn October, Lee announced he would partner with 1821 Comics on a multimedia imprint for children, Stan Lee's Kids Universe, a move he said addressed the lack of comic books targeted for that demographic; and that he was collaborating with the company on its futuristic graphic novel Romeo & Juliet: The War, by writer Max Work and artist Skan Srisuwan.[106][107] At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, Lee announced his YouTube channel, Stan Lee's World of Heroes, which airs programs created by Lee, Mark Hamill, Peter David, Adrianne Curry, and Bonnie Burton among others.[108][109][110][111] Lee wrote the book, Zodiac released in January 2015, with Stuart Moore.[112] The film Stan Lee's Annihilator, based on a Chinese prisoner-turned-superhero named Ming and in production since 2013, is set for a 2015 release.[113][114][115]\\r\\nIn his later career, Lee's contributions continued to expand outside the style that he helped pioneer. An example of this is his first work for DC Comics in the 2000s, launching the Just Imagine... series, in which Lee re-imagined the DC superheroes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, and the Flash.[116] Manga projects involving Lee include Karakurid?ji Ultimo, a collaboration with Hiroyuki Takei, Viz Media and Shueisha,[117] and Heroman, serialized in Square Enix's Monthly Shnen Gangan with the Japanese company Bones.[118][119] In 2011, Lee started writing a live-action musical, The Yin and Yang Battle of Tao.[120]\\r\\nThis period also saw a number of collaborators honor Lee for his influence on the comics industry. In 2006, Marvel commemorated Lee's 65 years with the company by publishing a series of one-shot comics starring Lee himself meeting and interacting with many of his co-creations, including Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, the Thing, Silver Surfer, and Doctor Doom. These comics also featured short pieces by such comics creators as Joss Whedon and Fred Hembeck, as well as reprints of classic Lee-written adventures.[121] At the 2007 Comic-Con International, Marvel Legends introduced a Stan Lee action figure. The body beneath the figure's removable cloth wardrobe is a re-used mold of a previously released Spider-Man action figure, with minor changes.[122] Comikaze Expo, Los Angeles' largest comic book convention, was rebranded as Stan Lee's Comikaze Presented by POW! Entertainment in 2012.[123]\\r\\nAt the 2016 Comic-Con International, Lee introduced his digital graphic novel Stan Lee's 'God Woke',[124][125][126] with text originally written as a poem he presented at Carnegie Hall in 1972.[127] The print-book version won the 2017 Independent Publisher Book Awards' Outstanding Books of the Year Independent Voice Award.[128]\\r\\nThe Stan Lee Foundation was founded in 2010 to focus on literacy, education, and the arts. Its stated goals include supporting programs and ideas that improve access to literacy resources, as well as promoting diversity, national literacy, culture and the arts.[129]\\r\\nStan Lee has donated portions of his personal effects to the University of Wyoming at various times, between 1981 and 2001.[130]\\r\\nStan Lee and his collaborator Jack Kirby appear as themselves in The Fantastic Four #10 (January 1963), the first of several appearances within the fictional Marvel Universe.[131] The two are depicted as similar to their real-world counterparts, creating comic books based on the \\"real\\" adventures of the Fantastic Four.\\r\\nLee was parodied by Kirby in comics published by rival DC Comics as Funky Flashman.[132] Kirby later portrayed himself, Lee, production executive Sol Brodsky, and Lee's secretary Flo Steinberg as superheroes in What If #11 (October 1978), \\"What If the Marvel Bullpen Had Become the Fantastic Four?\\", in which Lee played the part of Mister Fantastic. Lee has also made numerous cameo appearances in many Marvel titles, appearing in audiences and crowds at many characters' ceremonies and parties, and hosting an old-soldiers reunion in Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos #100 (July 1972). Lee appeared, unnamed, as the priest at Luke Cage and Jessica Jones' wedding in New Avengers Annual #1 (June 2006). He pays his respects to Karen Page at her funeral in Daredevil vol. 2, #8 (June 1998), and appears in The Amazing Spider-Man #169 (June 1977).\\r\\nIn 1994, artist Alex Ross rendered Lee as a bar patron on page 44 of Marvels #3.[133]\\r\\nIn Marvel's \\"Flashback\\" series of titles cover-dated July 1997, a top-hatted caricature of Lee as a ringmaster introduced stories that detailed events in Marvel characters' lives before they became superheroes, in special \\"-1\\" editions of many Marvel titles. The \\"ringmaster\\" depiction of Lee was originally from Generation X #17 (July 1996), where the character narrated a story set primarily in an abandoned circus. Though the story itself was written by Scott Lobdell, the narration by \\"Ringmaster Stan\\" was written by Lee, and the character was drawn in that issue by Chris Bachalo.\\r\\nLee and other comics creators are mentioned on page 479 of Michael Chabon's 2000 novel about the comics industry The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Chabon also acknowledges a debt to Lee and other creators on the book's Author's Note page.\\r\\nOn one of the last pages of Truth: Red, White & Black, Lee appears in a real photograph among other celebrities on a wall of the Bradley home.[134] Under his given name of Stanley Lieber, Stan Lee appears briefly in Paul Malmont's 2006 novel The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril.[135]\\r\\nIn Stan Lee Meets Superheroes, which Lee wrote, he comes into contact with some of his favorite creations.[121] Stan Lee and Jack Kirby appear as professors in Marvel Adventures Spider-Man #19.\\r\\nIn Lavie Tidhar's 2013 The Violent Century, Lee appears ÿ under his birth name of \\"Stanley Martin Lieber\\" ÿ as a historian of superhumans.[136]\\r\\nLee has had cameo appearances in many Marvel film and television projects. A few of these appearances are self-aware and sometimes reference Lee's involvement in the creation of certain characters. Lee has been a credited executive producer on most Marvel film and television projects since the 1990 direct-to-video Captain America film.\\r\\nIn the original February 7, 1998, broadcast airing of the Superman: The Animated Series episode \\"Apokolips... Now! Part 2\\" on the Kids' WB programming block, an animated Funky Flashman was visible mourning the death of Daniel \\"Terrible\\" Turpin, a character based on his longtime Marvel Comics collaborator Jack Kirby. This shot was later modified to remove the likeness of Lee and of other background Marvel characters when the episode was released on DVD.[172][173]\\r\\nLee was raised in a Jewish family. In a 2002 survey of whether he believes in God, he stated, \\"Well, let me put it this way... [Pauses.] No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I really don't know. I just don't know.\\"[200]\\r\\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Lee lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in the East 90s in Manhattan.[201] He married Joan Clayton Boocock on December 5, 1947,[202][203] and in 1949, the couple bought house at 1084 West Broadway in Woodmere, New York, on Long Island, living there through 1952.[204] Their daughter Joan Celia \\"J. C.\\" Lee was born in 1950. Another child, daughter Jan Lee, died three days after delivery in 1953.[205] The Lees resided at 226 Richards Lane in the Long Island town of Hewlett Harbor, New York, from 1952 to 1980.[206] They also owned a condominium at 220 East 63rd Street in Manhattan from 1975 to 1980,[207] and, during the 1970s, a vacation home on Cutler Lane in Remsenburg, New York.[208] For their move to the west coast in 1981, he and his wife bought a home in West Hollywood, California previously owned by comedian Jack Benny's radio announcer, Don Wilson.[209]\\r\\nIn late September 2012, Lee underwent an operation to insert a pacemaker, cancelling planned appearances at conventions.[210][211]\\r\\nOn July 6, 2017, his wife of 69 years, Joan, died of complications from a stroke. She was 95 years old.[212]\\r\\nOn July 14, 2017, Lee and Jack Kirby were named Disney Legends for their creation of numerous characters that would comprise Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe.[230]\\r\\nOn July 18, 2017, as part of D23 Disney Legends event, a ceremony was held on TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood Boulevard where Stan Lee imprinted his hands, feet and signature in cement.[231]\\r\\nLee's comics work includes:[82]\\r\\nI applied for a job in a publishing company ... I didn't even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, \\"Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House.\\" When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, 'Well, I'll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I'll get out into the real world.' ... I just wanted to know, 'What do you do in a publishing company?' How do you write? ... How do you publish? I was an assistant. There were two people there named Joe Simon and Jack Kirby ÿ Joe was sort-of the editor/artist/writer, and Jack was the artist/writer. Joe was the senior member. They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, 'Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?' When you're 17, what do you know? I said, 'Sure! I can do it!' I think he forgot about me, because I stayed there ever since.[20]\\r\\nHowever, in his 2002 autobiography, Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee he writes:\\r\\nMy uncle, Robbie Solomon, told me they might be able to use someone at a publishing company where he worked. The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me. ... So I contacted the man Robbie said did the hiring, Joe Simon, and applied for a job. He took me on and I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week....\\r\\nJoe Simon, in his 1990 autobiography The Comic Book Makers, gives the account slightly differently: \\"One day [Goodman's relative known as] Uncle Robbie came to work with a lanky 17-year-old in tow. 'This is Stanley Lieber, Martin's wife's cousin,' Uncle Robbie said. 'Martin wants you to keep him busy.'\\"\\r\\nIn an appendix, however, Simon appears to reconcile the two accounts. He relates a 1989 conversation with Lee:\\r\\nLee: I've been saying this [classified-ad] story for years, but apparently it isn't so. And I can't remember because I['ve] said it so long now that I believe it.\\"\\r\\n...\\r\\nSimon: \\"Your Uncle Robbie brought you into the office one day and he said, 'This is Martin Goodman's wife's nephew.' [sic] ... You were seventeen years old.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLee: \\"Sixteen and a half!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSimon: \\"Well, Stan, you told me seventeen. You were probably trying to be older.... I did hire you.\\"\\r\\nThe DC comics were ... one dimensional characters whose only characteristic was they dressed up in costumes and did good. Whereas Stan Lee had this huge breakthrough of two-dimensional characters. So, they dress up in costumes and do good, but they've got a bad heart. Or a bad leg. I actually did think for a long while that having a bad leg was an actual character trait.","input":"Who was the first hero stan lee created?"},{"output":"Finland","context":"Coordinates: 601332N 244503E? / ?60.2254749N 24.7508775E? / 60.2254749; 24.7508775\\r\\nNokia (Finnish: Nokia, Finnish pronunciation:?[?noki], UK: /?n?ki?/, US: /?no?ki?/) is a Finnish multinational communications, information technology and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2016, Nokia employed approximately 101,000 people across over 100 countries, did business in more than 130 countries, and reported annual revenues of around ?23.6 billion.[3] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 415th-largest company measured by 2016 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]\\r\\nThe company has had various industries in its 152-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development and licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM, 3G and LTE standards (and currently in 5G), and is best known for having been the largest worldwide vendor of mobile phones and smartphones for a period. After a partnership with Microsoft and market struggles, its mobile phone business was eventually bought by the former,[8][9] creating Microsoft Mobile as its successor in 2014.[10] After the sale, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business and on the Internet of things, marked by the divestiture of its Here mapping division and the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent. The company also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings),[11][12] and is the owner of scientific research organization Bell Labs.[13] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through a licensing arrangement with HMD Global.[14]\\r\\nThe company is viewed with national pride by Finns, as its successful mobile phone business made it by far the largest worldwide company and brand from Finland.[15] At its peak in 2000, during the telecoms bubble, Nokia alone accounted for 4% of the country's GDP, 21% of total exports and 70% of the Helsinki Stock Exchange market capital.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNokia's history dates back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia, offering better hydropower resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company from it and called it Nokia Ab (in Swedish, Nokia Company being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.\\r\\nIdestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into electricity generation by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 Suomen Gummitehdas (Finnish Rubber Works), a rubber business founded by Eduard Pol܇n, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.\\r\\nIn 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and Kaapelitehdas (the Cable Factory), all now jointly under the leadership of Pol܇n. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.\\r\\nNokia at the time also made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[18]\\r\\nIn 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.\\r\\nAfter Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that technologic co-operation after the end of the Cold War dtente in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with The Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[19] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.\\r\\nIn 1977, Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called \\"Nordic Japan\\". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.\\r\\nIn 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its \\"Schaub-Lorenz\\" and \\"Graetz\\" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the \\"ITT Nokia\\" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Gnrale d'Electricit (CGE), the predecessor of Alcatel, in 1986.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems,[20] which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.\\r\\nNokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.\\r\\nIn 1987, Kaapelitehdas discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.\\r\\nMobira 800-NDB non-directional beacon located in the Finnish Air Force signals museum\\r\\nNokia MAC 8532 laser rangefinder previously used by Finnish coastal artillery\\r\\nH?meenlinna artillery museum display containing fire control officer with Nokia artillery calculator in Finnish artillery battalion command post\\r\\nLate 1980s MikroMikko 4 TT m216 desktop computer in the Museum of Technology, Helsinki, Finland\\r\\nITT Nokia television with an ITT Nokia VCR (ITT/SEL)\\r\\nA 1986 Mobira pager\\r\\nFollowing Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.\\r\\nVuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result, he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.\\r\\nNokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900?MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[21]\\r\\nSalora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy. The brand continued to be used for televisions until 1995.\\r\\nOn 12 June 1996, Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada/Hong Kong-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[22] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included a factory in Turku, and the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[23] Some of these brands were later sold to other companies.\\r\\nNokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[24] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[25] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[26]\\r\\nIn October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[27] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[28] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.\\r\\nNokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[29] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[30] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[31] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[32]\\r\\nIn 1998, Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[33] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[34]\\r\\nIn 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[35]\\r\\nThe Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone on sale in North America in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[36] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smart phones for the next six years.[37] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as \\"best mobile imaging device\\" in Europe in 2007.[38] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[39] which helped it win the award of \\"best mobile imaging\\" device in Europe in 2008.[40] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[41] They were also well known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[42]\\r\\nIn 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[43] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted \\"Game Boy is for 10-year-olds\\",[44] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[45]\\r\\nNokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[46] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[47]\\r\\nIn 2005 Nokia developed a Linux-based operating system called Maemo, which shipped that year on the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet.\\r\\nOn 1 June 2006, Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[48]\\r\\nIn August 2007, Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new Internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[49] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[50]\\r\\nIn October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. In November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[51]\\r\\nNokia briefly returned to the computer market with the Booklet 3G netbook in August 2009.\\r\\nIn April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[52] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[53] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history.[54]\\r\\nThe old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[55] However, in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[56] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android. Meanwhile, in 2010 for Nokia's Linux ambitions, Nokia collaborated with Intel to form the MeeGo project, after the merger of Nokia's own Maemo and Intel's Moblin.\\r\\nNokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iOS and Android. To counter this, Nokia planned to make their MeeGo Linux operating system the company's flagship on smartphones. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[57] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[58][59]\\r\\nOn 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as \\"compensation for lost income from his prior employer,\\" on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[60] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.\\r\\nWhen the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[61] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[62] the company had had huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[63] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[64] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.\\r\\nIn July 2013, Nokia bought Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[65] until being rebranded as Nokia Networks soon after.[66] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[67]\\r\\nAfter the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia focused on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[68]\\r\\nIn October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[69]\\r\\nOn 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was \\"valuable\\" but \\"is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently.\\"[70] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[71] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would \\"look and feel just like Nokia built it.\\"[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[72]\\r\\nAccording to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[73] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products and seeking of sales partners.[74] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[75]\\r\\nOn 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[76] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be \\"the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions,\\" with more technologic products expected in the future.[77] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[78] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[79] and is listed on its official website as $40,000.[80]\\r\\nOn 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[81] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for ?15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[82] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[83][84] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[82][85] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[86] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[87] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[88] but was not complete until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.\\r\\nOn 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for ?2.8 billion.[89] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[90]\\r\\nOn 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[91][92]\\r\\nOn 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[93][94] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[95][96] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.\\r\\nOn 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[97] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[98]\\r\\nOn 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[99]\\r\\nNokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[100][101] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[102] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[103]\\r\\nNokia comprises two business groups along with further subsidiaries and affiliated firms.\\r\\nNokia Networks is Nokia Corporation's largest division. It is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland, and is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2016 revenues (after Huawei, Ericsson and Cisco). It has operations in around 150 countries.[104] Nokia Networks provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms and professional services to operators and service providers.[105] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.\\r\\nThe Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[106] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it to Nokia Solutions and Networks, shortly thereafter changed to simply Nokia Networks.[107]\\r\\nNokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops consumer products and licenses technology including the Nokia brand.[108] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program.

The technology \\"enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes\\".[153]\\r\\nDuring the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to use of deep packet inspection.[154]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime.

Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, \\"Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours.\\" This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in \\"virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers\\".[161] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[160]\\r\\nIn June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[162] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[163][164]\\r\\nNokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[165] The unpaid TDS of ?30?billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[166]","input":"Which country is the owner of nokia company?"},{"output":"\\"New order of the ages\\"","context":"The phrase Novus ordo seclorum (Latin for \\"New order of the ages\\"; English:  /?no?v?s ???rdo? s??kl??r?m/; Latin pronunciation:?[?novus ?ordo se?klorum]) is the second of two mottos that appear on the reverse (or back side) of the Great Seal of the United States. (The first motto is Annuit c?ptis, literally translated \\"[He/she/it] has favored our undertakings\\".) The Great Seal was first designed in 1782, and has been printed on the back of the United States one-dollar bill since 1935. The phrase  Novus ordo seclorum is sometimes mistranslated as \\"New World Order\\" by people who believe in a conspiracy behind the design.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phrase is a reference to the fourth Eclogue of Virgil,[1] which contains a passage (lines 5-8[2])  that reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forms saecla, saeclorum etc. were normal alternatives to the more common saecula etc. throughout the history of Latin poetry and prose. The form saeculorum is impossible in hexameter verse: the ae and o are long, the u short by position. For the medieval exchange between ae, ? and e, see ?; the word medieval (medi?val) itself is another example.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedieval Christians read  Virgil's poem as a prophecy of the coming of Christ. The Augustan Age, although pre-Christian, was viewed as a golden age preparing the world for the coming of Christ. The great poets of this age were viewed as a source of revelation and light upon the Christian mysteries to come.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word seclorum does not mean \\"secular\\", as one might assume, but is the genitive (possessive) plural form of the word saeculum, meaning (in this context) generation, century, or age. Saeculum did come to mean \\"age, world\\" in late, Christian Latin, and \\"secular\\" is derived from it, through secularis. However,  the adjective \\"secularis,\\" meaning \\"worldly,\\" is not equivalent to the genitive plural \\"seclorum,\\" meaning \\"of the ages.\\"[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the motto Novus ordo seclorum can be translated as \\"A new order of the ages.\\" It was proposed by Charles Thomson, the Latin expert who was involved in the design of the Great Seal of the United States, to signify \\"the beginning of the new American Era\\" as of the date of the Declaration of Independence.[1][5]","input":"What is the meaning of novus ordo seclorum?"},{"output":"between 280 and 247 BC","context":"The Lighthouse of Alexandria, sometimes called the Pharos of Alexandria (/?f??r?s/; Ancient Greek: ? ?? ?? ?ϫѴϚ?ϫ?, contemporary Koine Greek pronunciation:?[ho p?.ros te?s a.lek.sandr?a?s]), was a lighthouse built by the Ptolemaic Kingdom between 280 and 247 BC which has been estimated to be 100 metres in overall height.[1] One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, for many centuries it was one of the tallest man-made structures in the world. Badly damaged by three earthquakes between AD 956 and 1323, it then became an abandoned ruin. It was the third longest surviving ancient wonder (after the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and the extant Great Pyramid of Giza) until 1480, when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the Citadel of Qaitbay on the site. In 1994, French archaeologists discovered some remains of the lighthouse on the floor of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour.[2] The Ministry of State of Antiquities in Egypt has planned, as of late 2015, to turn submerged ruins of ancient Alexandria, including those of the Pharos, into an underwater museum.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPharos was a small island located on the western edge of the Nile Delta. In 332 BC Alexander the Great founded the city of Alexandria on an isthmus opposite Pharos. Alexandria and Pharos were later connected by a mole[4] spanning more than 1200 metres (.75?mi), which was called the Heptastadion (\\"seven stadia\\"a stadium was a Greek unit of length measuring approximately 180?m). The east side of the mole became the Great Harbour, now an open bay; on the west side lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour. Today's city development lying between the present Grand Square and the modern Ras el-Tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole, and the Ras el-Tin promontory represents all that is left of the island of Pharos,[5] the site of the lighthouse at its eastern point having been weathered away by the sea.\\r\\nThe lighthouse was constructed in the 3rd century BC. After Alexander the Great died, the first Ptolemy (Ptolemy I Soter) announced himself king in 305 BC, and commissioned its construction shortly thereafter. The building was finished during the reign of his son, the second Ptolemy (Ptolemy II Philadelphus). It took twelve years to complete, at a total cost of 800?talents,[6] and served as a prototype for all later lighthouses in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top, and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone.\\r\\nStrabo reported that Sostratus had a dedication inscribed in metal letters to the \\"Saviour Gods\\". Later Pliny the Elder wrote that Sostratus was the architect, which is disputed.[7] In the second century AD the satirist Lucian wrote that Sostratus inscribed his name under plaster bearing the name of Ptolemy. This was so that when the plaster with Ptolemy's name fell off, Sostratus's name would be visible in the stone.[8][9]\\r\\nJudith McKenzie writes that \\"The Arab descriptions of the lighthouse are remarkably consistent, although it was repaired several times especially after earthquake damage. The height they give varies only fifteen per cent from c.?103 to 118?m (338 to 387?ft), on a base c.?30 by 30?m (98 by 98?ft) square.\\"[10]\\r\\nThe fullest description of the lighthouse comes from Arab traveller Abou Haggag Youssef Ibn Mohammed el-Balawi el-Andaloussi, who visited Alexandria in A.D.?1166.[11]\\r\\nThe Arab authors indicate that the lighthouse was constructed from large blocks of light-coloured stone, the tower was made up of three tapering tiers: a lower square section with a central core, a middle octagonal section, and, at the top, a circular section. At its apex was positioned a mirror which reflected sunlight during the day; a fire was lit at night. Extant Roman coins struck by the Alexandrian mint show that a statue of a Triton was positioned on each of the building's four corners. A statue of Poseidon or Zeus stood atop the lighthouse.[12] The Pharos's masonry blocks were interlocked, sealed together using molten lead, to withstand the pounding of the waves.[13]\\r\\nAl-Masudi writes that the seaward-facing eastern side featured an inscription dedicated to Zeus.[14]\\r\\nThe lighthouse was badly damaged in the earthquake of 956, and then again in 1303 and 1323. Finally the stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-Sultan of Egypt, Qaitbay, built a medieval fort on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone.\\r\\nThe 10th-century writer al-Mas'udi reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse's destruction, according to which at the time of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r.?705ÿ715) the Byzantines sent a eunuch agent, who adopted Islam, gained the Caliph's confidence, and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse. The search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined, and the Pharos collapsed. The agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him.[15]\\r\\nIn 1968 the lighthouse was rediscovered. UNESCO sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine archaeologists, led by Honor Frost, to the site. She confirmed the existence of the ruins representing part of the lighthouse. Due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone, exploration was put on hold.[16]\\r\\nGreek archaeologists led by Jean-Yves Empereur re-discovered the physical remains of the lighthouse in late 1994 on the floor of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour. Some of these remains were brought up and were lying at the harbour on public view at the end of 1995. [2] Subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains. It is possible to go diving and see the ruins. The secretariat of the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage are currently working with the Government of Egypt on an initiative to add the Bay of Alexandria (to include remains of the lighthouse) on a World Heritage List of submerged cultural sites.[17]\\r\\nLegend has it that the people of the island of Pharos were wreckers; hence, Ptolemy I had the lighthouse built to help guide ships into port at night.[18]\\r\\nPharos became the etymological origin of the word \\"lighthouse\\" in Greek (??), Persian (Fns ÿ ?????), many Romance languages such as French (phare), Italian and Spanish (faro), Romanian (far) and Portuguese (farol), and even some Slavic languages like Bulgarian (far). In Russian, a derived word means \\"headlight\\" (fara ÿ ).\\r\\nIn 2008 it was suggested[19] that the Pharos was the vertical yardstick used in the first precise measurement of the size of the earth.\\r\\nSince 1978 a number of proposals have been made to replace the lighthouse with a modern reconstruction. In 2015, the Egyptian government and the Alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of Alexandria Port. The plan was opposed by Alexandria-based sociologist Amro Ali.[20]\\r\\nThe lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of Alexandria and of the Alexandria Governorate with which the city is more or less coterminous. A stylised representation of the lighthouse appears on the flag and seal of the Governorate and on many public services of the city, including the seal of Alexandria University.\\r\\nNow because of the narrowness of the strait there can be no access by ship to the harbour without the consent of those who hold the Pharos. In view of this, Caesar took the precaution of landing his troops while the enemy was preoccupied with fighting, seized the Pharos and posted a garrison there. The result was that safe access was secured for his corn supplies and reinforcements.[23]\\r\\n\\"After he [Sostratus] had built the work he wrote his name on the masonry inside, covered it with gypsum, and having hidden it inscribed the name of the reigning king. He knew, as actually happened, that in a very short time the letters would fall away with the plaster and there would be revealed: 'Sostratus of Cnidos, the son of Dexiphanes, to the Divine Saviours, for the sake of them that sail at sea.' Thus, not even he had regard for the immediate moment or his own brief life-time: he looked to our day and eternity, as long as the tower shall stand and his skill abide. History then should be written in that spirit, with truthfulness and an eye to future expectations rather than with adulation and a view to the pleasure of present praise.\\"","input":"When was the light house of alexandria built?"},{"output":"August 28, 2012","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLutra nippon Suzuki,?1996\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra whiteleyi) (?YH, Nihon-kawauso[1]) is an extinct variety of otter formerly widespread in Japan. Dating back to the 1880s, it was even seen in Tokyo. The population suddenly shrank in the 1930s, and the mammal nearly vanished. Since then, it has only been spotted several times, in 1964 in the Seto Inland Sea, and in the Uwa Sea in 1972 and 1973. The last official sighting was in the southern part of Kchi Prefecture in 1979, when it was photographed in the mouth of the Shinjo River in Susaki. It was subsequently classified as a \\"Critically Endangered\\" species on the Japanese Red List.[2] On August 28, 2012, the Japanese river otter was officially declared extinct by the Ministry of the Environment.[3][4] It is the official animal symbol of Ehime Prefecture.[5] In February 2017, a wild otter was caught on camera on Tsushima Island, Nagasaki Prefecture. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral genetic studies have suggested that the Japanese river otter should be treated as a distinct species Lutra nippon rather than a subspecies of Lutra lutra.[7] However, this reclassification is not yet generally accepted in the absence of further verification.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nFully grown, a Japanese otter was between 65 and 80?cm (25.5 and 31.5?in) long, with a tail measuring 45 to 50?cm (17.5 to 19.5?in). It had a thick, lush coat of dark brown fur with short webbed feet. In addition the river otter has two types/sets of fur. Data has shown that the river otter would shed their under fur fully from May to August. After the shedding of the under fur, the otter shed their guard hair from August to November. This allowed them to adjust to the seasons changing.[9] The otter had a lifespan of up to 25 years.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nA nocturnal creature, an otter only left its den after dark to forage for food. Claiming a territory about ten miles in diameter, it marked the area with its droppings about one to three miles apart and sets up three or four nests under rocks or inside bushes. The otters were always on the move, visiting each den only once every three to four days. They were considered an adult after only one year. They would then venture on their own, but continue in solitude unless ready to mate.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the Japanese River Otter was ready to reproduce when they were two to three years old. In addition, the males sought out the females in the reproduction process. Besides during reproduction and with the exception of young males staying with their mother for a range of two to three years until they were mature, female otters and male otters didn't generally live together. When a male otter calls out to a female otter, she must give him permission for the mating. If she does not, the male would move onto the next female otter. For the male to know that the female is interested in mating, the female will roll around with the male, which releases hormones. The Japanese River Otter could have anywhere from one to six offspring per litter. Once born, the baby otters are completely blind for a month, leaving them utterly helpless. The female otter makes for a great mother; nursing her young for up to eight hours a day, as well as teaching them valuable lessons and protecting them. After the pups are around the age of four months, the mother otter will introduce her youth to solid food and start to teach them how to hunt.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most otters, the Japanese river otter was not an especially picky eater. While it primarily fed on fish, crab, and shrimp; it also ate eels, beetles, watermelons, and sweet potatoes. Many of these Japanese otters eat about 15% to 25% of their own body weight. Many otters spend around six hours to find food because of their difficult living space and their competition for food. The Japanese otter was known as one of the top carnivores in the aquatic food chain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, there were thousands of river otters in Japan. Starting in the Meiji period, the government of Japan adopted a policy of increasing wealth and military prowess. Animal pelts thus became very valuable since they could be exported for money. As a result, Japanese river otters started to be hunted throughout the country. Their numbers soon dwindled. Populations made a slight comeback after the creation of hunting regulations.[12] Even so, pollution and human development then harmed their environment and resources to build their habitats. This pollution terminated their food sources in the rivers, causing them to hunt in more dangerous settings.[10] These causes grew rapidly, resulting in the extinction of the Japanese river otter in the late 20th century.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the 1990s, there were several attempts to locate a surviving Japanese river otter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1991, the Environmental Agency of Japan in partnership with the Kochi prefectural government assembled a research team of experts and began their search. In March 1992, the research group found hair and excrement in Kochi Prefecture and believed to have come from an otter. Also found were three footprints, and ten additional excrement samples. After an analysis of a cross-section of the hair, the researchers determined that it came from an otter. An official from the agency's wildlife protection section stated that the hair was \\"scientifically solid evidence that confirms the existence of the Japanese Otter.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, zoological experts visited the area where the excrement was found. They discovered remains of the animal's urine, which the animal is believed to leave during its courtship. The prefectural government of Kochi set up an infrared camera for six months from October 1994 to April 1995 in an effort to capture it on film, but all that was recorded were animals such as raccoon dogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween March 4 and 9, 1996, a group of zoo officials, municipal government officials and animals lovers from across the country searched for the river otter in the areas where finds have been made in the past. Such areas included coastal areas in Susaki, areas along the Niyodo River running through Sakawacho and Inocho, and coastal areas along Shimanto River. No evidence of the animal's existence was found.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong these, the presumed sighting reported in Kochi by a local artist with a detailed sketch was regarded \\"highly trustable\\" by Yoshihiko Machida, an emeritus professor at the Kchi University in 2009.[14] Dr. Machida also pointed that the previous studies by the prefecture had been restricted only among coastal areas and thus not filling the definition of extinct species by IUCN. Regarding this, a survey was conducted by Ehime Prefecture in 2014, noting several recent sightings.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2017, a wild otter was filmed alive on Tsushima Island in Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. However, it is not known whether the observed otter was a Japanese river otter.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch done in the early 1990s by the Department of Biology of Kochi University in Japan revealed some interesting facts about the genes of the Japanese River Otter. For many years, it was thought that the Japanese river otter was a subspecies of the Eurasian otter Lutra lutra. However, the studies done in Kochi University revealed something different. By comparing the Mitochondrial Cytochrome b Gene of a mummified Japanese river otter corpse with Eurasian otters from Latvia and China, it was proven that the Japanese river otter was actually different, and was therefore not a subspecies. The name for the Japanese river otter was then changed from L. l. whiteleyi to Lutra nippon.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese river otter was used as medicine to help cure tuberculosis. Typically a dosage that would last about forty days would cost roughly three hundred US dollars.[17]\\r\\nBeginning in the early 20th century, the otter pelts were used for military purposes as well. In 1929, the government established the \\"Hunters Association\\" which called upon people to hunt and skin these otters, which was one of the main causes of their eventual extinction.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese river otter was named the official animal symbol of Japan's Ehime Prefecture, a region of Japan in northwestern Shikoku.[5]","input":"When did the japanese river otter become extinct?"},{"output":"Trevi Fountain","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini. Standing 26.3 metres (86?ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3?ft) wide,[1] it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world. The fountain has appeared in several notable films, including Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita, the eponymous Three Coins in the Fountain, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and Roman Holiday.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fountain at the junction of three roads (tre vie)[3] marks the terminal point[4] of the \\"modern\\" Acqua Vergine, the revived Aqua Virgo, one of the aqueducts that supplied water to ancient Rome.

However, the eventual indirect route of the aqueduct made its length some 22?km (14?mi). This Aqua Virgo led the water into the Baths of Agrippa. It served Rome for more than 400 years.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1629 Pope Urban VIII, finding the earlier fountain insufficiently dramatic, asked Gian Lorenzo Bernini to sketch possible renovations, but the project was abandoned when the pope died. Though Bernini's project was never constructed, there are many Bernini touches in the fountain as it exists today. An early, influential model by Pietro da Cortona, preserved in the Albertina, Vienna, also exists, as do various early 18th century sketches, most unsigned, as well as a project attributed to Nicola Michetti[6] one attributed to Ferdinando Fuga[7] and a French design by Edm Bouchardon.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompetitions had become popular during the Baroque era to design buildings, fountains, as well as the Spanish Steps. In 1730 Pope Clement XII organized a contest in which Nicola Salvi initially lost to Alessandro Galilei?ÿ but due to the outcry in Rome over a Florentine having won, Salvi was awarded the commission anyway.[9] Work began in 1732.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalvi died in 1751 with his work half finished, but he had made sure a barber's unsightly sign would not spoil the ensemble, hiding it behind a sculpted vase,[10] called by Romans the asso di coppe, the \\"Ace of Cups\\", because of its resemblance to a Tarot card.[11] Four different sculptors were hired to complete the fountain's decorations: Pietro Bracci (whose statue of Oceanus sits in the central niche), Filippo della Valle, Giovanni Grossi, and Andrea Bergondi.[12] Giuseppe Pannini was hired as architect.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Trevi Fountain was finished in 1762 by Pannini, who substituted the present allegories for planned sculptures of Agrippa and Trivia, the Roman virgin.[14] It was officially opened and inaugurated on May 22 by Pope Clement XIII.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of the piece is made from Travertine stone, quarried near Tivoli, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) east of Rome.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fountain was refurbished once in 1988 to remove discoloration caused by smog,[17] and again in 1998; the stonework was scrubbed and all cracks and other areas of deterioration were repaired by skilled artisans, and the fountain was equipped with recirculating pumps.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2013, it was announced that the Italian fashion company Fendi would sponsor a 20-month, 2.2-million-euro restoration of the fountain; it was to be the most thorough restoration in the fountain's history.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nRestoration work began in June 2014 and was completed in November 2015. The fountain was reopened with an official ceremony on the evening of November 3, 2015. The restoration included the installation of more than 100 LED lights to improve the nighttime illumination of the fountain.[20][21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe backdrop for the fountain is the Palazzo Poli, given a new fa?ade with a giant order of Corinthian pilasters that link the two main stories.[23] Taming of the waters is the theme of the gigantic scheme that tumbles forward, mixing water and rockwork, and filling the small square. Tritons guide Oceanus' shell chariot, taming hippocamps.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the centre a robustly-modelled triumphal arch is superimposed on the palazzo fa?ade. The centre niche or exedra framing Oceanus has free-standing columns for maximal light and shade. In the niches flanking Oceanus, Abundance spills water from her urn and Salubrity holds a cup from which a snake drinks. Above, bas reliefs illustrate the Roman origin of the aqueducts.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tritons and horses provide symmetrical balance, with the maximum contrast in their mood and poses[citation needed] (by 1730, rococo was already in full bloom in France and Germany).\\r\\n\\r\\nCoins are purportedly meant to be thrown using the right hand over the left shoulder.[26] This was the theme of 1954's Three Coins in the Fountain and the Academy Award-winning song by that name which introduced the picture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn estimated 3,000 euros are thrown into the fountain each day.[27] In 2016, an estimated ?1.4 million (US$1.5 million) was thrown into the fountain.[28] The money has been used to subsidize a supermarket for Rome's needy;[27] however, there are regular attempts to steal coins from the fountain, even though it is illegal to do so.[27][29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevi Fountain\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevi Fountain at night\\r\\n\\r\\nSculptures at night\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevi Fountain papal coat of arms\\r\\n\\r\\nTrevi Fountain as viewed from the side\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1973, Italian National Postal Service dedicated a postage stamp to the Trevi Fountain.[18]","input":"What is the most famous fountain in rome?"},{"output":"the central part of the many animal bodies (including that of the human) from which extend the neck and limbs","context":"The torso or trunk is an anatomical term for the central part of the many animal bodies (including that of the human) from which extend the neck and limbs.[1] The torso includes the thorax and the abdomen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost critical organs are housed within the torso.

The UK's applications to join in 1963 and 1967 were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, who said that \\"a number of aspects of Britain's economy, from working practices to agriculture\\" had \\"made Britain incompatible with Europe\\" and that Britain harboured a \\"deep-seated hostility\\" to any pan-European project.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce de Gaulle had relinquished the French presidency in 1969, the UK made a third and successful application for membership. The question of sovereignty had been discussed at the time in an official Foreign and Commonwealth Office document. It listed among \\"Areas of policy in which parliamentary freedom to legislate will be affected by entry into the European Communities\\": Customs duties, Agriculture, Free movement of labour, services and capital, Transport, and Social Security for migrant workers. The document concluded (paragraph 26) that it was advisable to put the considerations of influence and power before those of formal sovereignty.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Treaty of Accession was signed in January 1972 by the then prime minister Edward Heath, leader of the Conservative Party.[7] Parliament's European Communities Act 1972 was enacted on 17 October, and the UK's instrument of ratification was deposited the next day (18 October),[8] letting the United Kingdom's membership of the EC come into effect on 1 January 1973.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, the United Kingdom held its first ever national referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Communities. The opposition Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, had contested the October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain's terms of membership of the EC and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms.[10] All of the major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. However, there were significant divides within the ruling Labour Party; a 1975 one-day party conference voted by two to one in favour of withdrawal,[11] and seven of the 23 cabinet ministers were opposed to EC membership,[12] with Harold Wilson suspending the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility to allow those ministers to publicly campaign against the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 June 1975, the electorate were asked to vote yes or no on the question: \\"Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?\\" Every administrative county and region in the UK returned majority \\"Yes\\" votes, apart from the Shetland Islands and the Outer Hebrides. With a turnout of just under 65%, the outcome of the vote was 67.2% in favour of staying in, and the United Kingdom remained a member of the EC.[13] Support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975, in the data, appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, the United Kingdom opted out of the newly formed European Monetary System (EMS), which was the precursor to the creation of the euro currency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposition Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum.[15] It was heavily defeated; the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher was re-elected.

The United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling came under pressure from currency speculators (an episode known as Black Wednesday). The resulting cost to UK taxpayers was estimated to be in excess of S3?billion.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Communities became the European Union on 1 November 1993.[18] The new name reflected the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political union.[19] As a result of the Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, the Maastricht Treaty is now known, in updated form as, the Treaty on European Union (2007) or TEU, and the Treaty of Rome is now known, in updated form, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (2007) or TFEU.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Referendum Party was formed in 1994 by Sir James Goldsmith to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.[20] It fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votes or 2.6% of the total votes cast.[21] It failed to win a single parliamentary seat because its vote was spread out across the country, and lost its deposit (funded by Goldsmith) in 505 constituencies.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was also formed, in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than the Labour or Conservative parties had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election.[22] UKIP's electoral success in the 2014 European election has been documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, UKIP won two by-elections, triggered by defecting Conservative MPs, and in the 2015 general election took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) was drafted in 1950, largely under British leadership,[citation needed] and its court (ECtHR) was established in 1953.  EU institutions are bound under article 6 of the Treaty of Nice[citation needed] to respect human rights under the Convention, over and above for example the Law of the United Kingdom.[25] The Court was criticised especially within the Conservative Party for ruling in favour of British prisoners obtaining the right to vote.[26][27][28][29]  During the referendum the then Home Secretary, Theresa May, had called for the UK to leave the ECHR[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a statistical analysis published in April 2016, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University defined Euroscepticism as the wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU, and conversely Europhilia as the desire to preserve or increase the powers of the EU. According to this definition, the British Social Attitudes (BSA) surveys show an increase in euroscepticism from 38% (1993) to 65% (2015). Euroscepticism should however not be confused with the wish to leave the EU: the BSA survey for the period JulyÿNovember 2015 shows that 60% backed the option \\"continue as an EU member\\", and only 30% backed the option to \\"withdraw\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1977, both pro- and anti-European views have had majority support at different times, with some dramatic swings between the two camps.[32] In the United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. The highest-ever rejection of membership was in 1980, the first full year of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's term of office, with 65% opposed to and 26% in favour of membership.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Thatcher had negotiated a rebate of British membership payments in 1984, those favouring the EC maintained a lead in the opinion polls, except during 2000, as Prime Minister Tony Blair aimed for closer EU integration, including adoption of the euro currency, and around 2011, as immigration into the United Kingdom became increasingly noticeable.[32] As late as December 2015 there was, according to ComRes, a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU, albeit with a warning that voter intentions would be considerably influenced by the outcome of Prime Minister David Cameron's ongoing EU reform negotiations, especially with regards to the two issues of \\"safeguards for non-Eurozone member states\\" and \\"immigration\\".[33] The following events are relevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2017 to 2019, UK has engaged in negotiating a Brexit between the European Union and herself.

It is expected that sufficient progress is performed in each of the three issues.","input":"When did great britain join the european union?"},{"output":"December 3, 1967","context":"Christiaan Neethling Barnard (8 November 1922?ÿ 2 September 2001) was a South African cardiac surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant on December 3, 1967,[1][2] and the second overall heart transplant (James Hardy did a xenotransplant in 1964[3]). Growing up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, he studied medicine and practised for several years in his native country.[4] As a young doctor experimenting on dogs, Barnard developed a remedy for the infant defect of intestinal atresia. His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.[5] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Wangensteen.[6] Vince Gott introduced him to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei.[7] Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.[8]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted a heart from a person who had just died from a head injury, with full permission of the donor's family, into the chest of a 54-year-old Louis Washkansky. Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the reduction of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.[4][9] Barnard did state to Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[10][11][12]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.[4][13]\\r\\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnard grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.[2] One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \\"blue baby\\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.[14] Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.\\r\\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.[4]\\r\\nBarnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province.[2] In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.[2] He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \\"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\\".\\r\\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.[5] Owen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.[15]\\r\\nIn December 1955, Barnard traveled to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.[6] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \\"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\\"). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.[7] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's 's service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway.[16] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.[17] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled \\"The aortic valve ÿ problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve\\".[2] The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled \\"The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia\\".[2] Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as \\"the most fascinating time in my life.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape .[8][18] He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants[19] (later he credited Demikhov's accomplishment saying that \\"if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.\\")[20] In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.[2] Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein's anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[21] Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.\\r\\nFollowing the first successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.[22][page?needed][23]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world's first heart transplant and world's first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.[3][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nBarnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.[29][30] [31]\\r\\nWith the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.[2][32] Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.[2][31]\\r\\nDuring the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician, helped teach over 3,000 surgeons, and assisted with Barnard's organ transplant program. Barnard said, \\"Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre.\\" People have differing recollections about whether Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.[33]\\r\\nBarnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967.[1][4][34] Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient.[9][35] Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty persons. The operation lasted approximately five hours.[31][36][37][35]\\r\\nBarnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success.[10][12][38] This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were \\"unfounded\\" and \\"misleading\\".[11]\\r\\nBarnard later wrote, \\"For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.\\" The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.[2] On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.[39] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.[40] The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.[41] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.[2] Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, \\"Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'\\"[2][31]\\r\\nWashkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days. However, he succumbed to pneumonia as he was taking immunosuppressive drugs.\\r\\nBarnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was photogenic, and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.\\r\\nWorldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.[42] Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. A U.S. National Institutes of Health publication states, \\"Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants.\\"[32]\\r\\nHowever, Barnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months.[4][13] Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.[43]\\r\\nBetween December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.[44]\\r\\nFull recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \\"piggy back\\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \\"double heart\\". Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.[44][45]\\r\\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, forty-nine consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.[44]\\r\\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\\r\\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.[citation needed] Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature on an anti-apartheid platform. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a \\"white South African\\".[46]\\r\\nShortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa; \\"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa\\"[47]\\r\\nIn answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a \\"benevolent dictator in South Africa\\", Dr. Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review;[48]\\r\\nThe interview ended with the following summary from he himself; \\"I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.\\"[48]\\r\\nBarnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children? Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951ÿ1984).[2][49] International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children? Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).[50] He divorced Zoellner in 1982.[50] Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.[50] They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.[50]\\r\\nBarnard described in his autobiography The Second Life a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida,[2][51] that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.[52]\\r\\nIn October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-CA), whom she was a staffer for at the time.[53][54][55]\\r\\nBarnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.[2] After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.\\r\\nHe had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter.[4] He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial \\"rejuvenation therapy\\" was practised.[56]\\r\\nBarnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.[57]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, One Life, was published in 1969 and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town. His second autobiography, The Second Life, was published in 1993, eight years before his death.\\r\\nApart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:","input":"When was the first heart transplant performed in the world?"},{"output":"Inland taipan","context":"","input":"What's the most poisonous snake on the planet?"},{"output":"Argentina","context":"Ushuaia (/u???wa?.?/; Spanish pronunciation:?[u?swa?a]) is the capital of Tierra del Fuego, Antrtida e Islas del Atlntico Sur Province, Argentina. It is commonly regarded as the southernmost city in the world.[2][3] Ushuaia is located in a wide bay on the southern coast of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, bounded on the north by the Martial mountain range, and on the south by the Beagle Channel. It is the only municipality in the Department of Ushuaia, which has an area of 9,390?km2 (3,625?sq?mi). It was founded October 12 of 1884 by Augusto Lasserre and is located on the shores of the Beagle Channel surrounded by the mountain range of the Martial Glacier, in the Bay of Ushuaia. Besides being an administrative center, it is a light industrial port and tourist hub.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word Ushuaia comes from the Yaghan language: ush and waia (\\"bay\\" or \\"cove\\") and means \\"deep bay\\" or \\"bay to background\\". The act creating the subprefecture in 1884 cites the name \\"Oshovia\\", one of the many orthographic variations of the word.[4] Its demonym is \\"Ushuaiense\\".\\r\\nThe name is often pronounced \\"u-sua-ia\\" (Spanish pronunciation:?[u?swa?a]), an exception to the orthographic rules of Spanish, since the 's' forms a syllable with the following 'u' despite the intervening 'h'. The pronunciation \\"Usuaa\\" (accented on the 'i') is erroneous: the prosodic accent is on the first 'a', which is why the word is written without an accent mark.\\r\\nThe municipality carried out a contest for the election of the image of the City Shield, approving by decree no28, in 1971, the design of Vicente G܇mez.[5]\\r\\nThe Selknam Indians, also called the Ona, first arrived in Tierra del Fuego about 10,000 years ago. The southern group of people indigenous to the area, The Yaghan (also known as Ymana), occupied what is now Ushuaia, lived in continual conflict with the northern inhabitants of the island.[6]\\r\\nFor much of the latter half of the 19th century, the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego was populated by a substantial majority of nationals who were not Argentine citizens, including a number of British subjects. Ushuaia was founded informally by British missionaries, following previous British surveys, long before Argentine nationals or government representatives arrived there on a permanent basis. The British ship HMS Beagle, under the command of Captain Robert FitzRoy, first reached the channel on January 29, 1833, during its maiden voyage surveying Tierra del Fuego.[7] The city was originally named by early British missionaries[8] using the native Ymana name for the area. Much of the early history of the city and its hinterland is described in Lucas Bridgess book Uttermost Part of the Earth (1948). The name Ushuaia first appears in letters and reports of the South American Mission Society[8] in England. The British missionary Waite Hockin Stirling[9] became the first European to live in Ushuaia when he stayed with the Ymana people between 18 January and mid-September 1869. In 1870 more British missionaries arrived to establish a small settlement. The following year the first marriage was performed. During 1872, 36 baptisms and 7 marriages and the first European birth (Thomas Despard Bridges) in Tierra del Fuego were registered.[10] The first house constructed in Ushuaia was a pre-assembled 3 room home prepared in the Falkland Islands in 1870 for Reverend Thomas Bridges. One room was for the Bridges family, a second was for a Ymana married couple, while the third served as the chapel.[11]\\r\\nThomas Bridges learned the Yaghan (coastal dwellers) language and was a fluent speaker. To a lesser extent he was able to communicate in the Ona (forest dwellers) language. His missionary work was mainly directed at the Yaghans. The word Yamana simply means \\"people\\" in the Yaghan language. He wrote a dictionary of the Yaghan language, the original manuscript of which is in the British Museum. As the Yaghans had no ability nor means to write, Thomas Bridges had to construct an alphabet which was suited to the phonetics of the language. The original manuscript was lost three times but recovered and almost published under an incorrect name. More than one alphabet has been used over the years in the rendering of this dictionary. The odyssey of the manuscript covered nearly half a century before it was finally published. Natalie Goodall was instrumental in reprinting the dictionary in 1987 and providing valuable insights into the history of Thomas Bridges' work. Copies of the dictionary provide material on the letters and pronunciations used which in many respects differ from the alphabet used in the English language. (Ref: A de la Rue).\\r\\nDuring 1873, Juan and Clara Lawrence, the first Argentine citizens to visit Ushuaia, arrived to teach school. That same year Julio Argentino Roca, who later served as Argentine President twice, promoted the establishment of a penal colony for re-offenders, modeled after one in Tasmania, Australia, in an effort to secure permanent residents from Argentina and to help establish Argentine sovereignty over all of Tierra del Fuego.[12][13] But only after the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina did formal efforts get under way to establish the township and its prison.\\r\\nDuring the 1880s, many gold prospectors came to Ushuaia following rumors of large gold fields, which proved to be false.[14][15] On 12 October 1884, as part of the South Atlantic Expedition, Commodore Augusto Lasserre established the sub-division of Ushuaia,[16] with the missionaries and naval officers signing the Act of Ceremony. Don Feliz M Paz was named Governor of Tierra del Fuego and in 1885 named Ushuaia as its capital. In 1885 the territory police was organized under Antonio A. Romero with headquarters also in Ushuaia. But it was not until 1904 that the Federal Government of Argentina recognized Ushuaia as the capital of Tierra del Fuego.[17]\\r\\nUshuaia suffered several epidemics, including typhus, pertussis, and measles, that decimated the native population. But because the Ymana were not included in census data, the exact numbers lost are not known. The first census was held in 1893, which recorded 113 men and 36 women living in Ushuaia. The prison was formally announced in an Executive order by the then-Acting President Roca in 1896.[10] By 1911 the Ymana had all practically disappeared, so the mission was closed.[18] The population grew to 1,558 by the 1914 census.\\r\\nIn 1896 the prison received its first inmates, mainly re-offenders and dangerous prisoners transferred from Buenos Aires, but also some political prisoners. A separate military prison opened in 1903 at the nearby Puerto Golondrina. The two prisons merged in 1910, and that combined complex still stands today.[9][19] Thus, during the first half of the 20th century, the city centered around the prison built by the Argentine government to increase the Argentine population and to ensure Argentine sovereignty over Tierra del Fuego.[12][13] The prison was intended for repeat offenders and serious criminals, following the example of the British in Tasmania and the French in Devil's Island.[13] Escape from Tierra del Fuego was similarly difficult, although two prisoners managed to escape into the surrounding area for a few weeks.[12] The prison population thus became forced colonists and spent much of their time building the town with timber from the forest around the prison. They also built a railway to the settlement,[20] now a tourist attraction known as the End of the World Train (Tren del Fin del Mundo), the southernmost railway in the world.\\r\\nThe prison operated until 1947, when President Juan Per܇n closed it by executive order in response to the many reports of abuse and unsafe practices.[9][19] Most of the guards stayed in Ushuaia, while the prisoners were relocated to other jails farther north. After the prison closed, it became a part of the Base Naval Ushuaia (in Spanish), functioning as a storage and office facility until the early 1990s.[21] Later it was converted into the current Museo Maritimo de Ushuaia.[22]\\r\\nThe naval base at Ushuaia was engaged during the Falklands War of 1982.[citation needed]. The Argentine cruiser ARA General Belgrano, subsequently sunk by the British Fleet, sailed from the Port of Ushuaia, where a memorial was erected in February 1996.\\r\\nIt is located at 6 meters above sea level, located on Ushuaia Bay, surrounded to the west, north and east by the Andes Fueguinos. From the position of the rest of Argentina, it is the only city in the country that is accessed by crossing part of the Andes mountain range that runs along the southern edge of the Tierra del Fuego. In order to proceed to Ushuaia, two major foothills of the Andes Fueguinos must be passed by means of the National Route 3 (National Route 3): the Sierra Sierras Alvear by means of the pass mountain range Paso Garibaldi y Garibaldi, and the Sierra Sorondo ÿ Montes Bridges through the valley of the Olivia River.[23][24][25] For this reason, in Argentina it is considered the only city trasandina, although to access it there is no Which cross the entire Andean chain.\\r\\nUshuaia has long been described as the southernmost city in the world.[2][3] While there are settlements farther south, the only one of any notable size is Puerto Williams, a Chilean settlement of some 2,000 residents.[26] As a center of population, commerce, and culture, and as a town of significant size and importance,[27] Ushuaia however clearly qualifies as a city. A 1998 article in the newspaper Clarn[28] reported that the designation \\"Southernmost city in the world\\" had been transferred to Puerto Williams by a joint committee from Argentina and Chile, but this was denied by Argentine authorities,[29][30] and the Secretariat of Tourism of Argentina continues to use the slogan in official documentation and web sites.[31]\\r\\nUshuaia features a significantly ocean-moderated mild tundra climate (K?ppen: ET); with both extremely mild winters and summers (average temperature remains above 1 C and below 10 C year round). Vegetation around the city thus does not resemble typical tundra but is instead heavily forested. Temperatures at the Ushuaia ÿ Malvinas Argentinas International Airport average 1.3?C (34.3?F) in the coolest month (July), and 9.6?C (49.3?F) in the warmest month (January).[32] The record low is ?21.0?C (?5.8?F) in July, and the record high is 29.5?C (85.1?F) in January.[33] On average, the city experiences 146 days of precipitation a year, with many cloudy and foggy days, averaging 206 cloudy days a year.[34] This results in Ushuaia receiving an average of 3.93 hours of sunshine per day (an annual total of 1,434 hours) or about 30.2% of possible sunshine.[33] Despite receiving only 529.7 millimetres (21?in) average annual precipitation, Ushuaia is very humid with an average humidity of 77%.[32]\\r\\nSummers tend to be cloudy and windy, with maximum temperatures averaging around 14?C (57?F) during the day and about 5?C (41?F) at night.[34] Temperatures of 20?C (68?F) or more occur only on a handful of days, and night frost is always possible, as well as days below 10.0?C (50?F). Temperatures gradually diminish during the autumn, to reach maximum temperatures of about 4.5?C (40?F) and minimum temperatures of ?1.4?C (29?F) in winter, with frequent snow, sleet and rain showers.[34] Some winters may bring extended periods of frost and snow, whereas other winters might just bring snowstorms followed by thaws. Temperatures then very slowly recover during the spring, but snow showers and frost are a common occurrence until the beginning of the summer in December, and they might occur even in midsummer.\\r\\nThe southwestern winds make the outer islands wetter, reaching 1,400?mm (55?in) at Isla de los Estados (Island of the States). Because temperatures are cool throughout the year, there is little evaporation. Snow is common in winter and regularly occurs throughout the year. Ushuaia occasionally experiences snow in summer (from November to March). Due to its high southern latitude, the city's climate is influenced by Antarctica, and the duration of daylight varies significantly, from more than 17 hours in summer to just over 7 hours in winter.\\r\\nThe main economic activities are fishing, natural gas and oil extraction[citation needed], sheep farming and ecotourism.\\r\\nTourist attractions include the Tierra del Fuego National Park and Lapataia Bay. The park can be reached by highway, or via the End of the World Train (Tren del Fin del Mundo) from Ushuaia. The city has a museum of Ymana, English, and Argentine settlement, including its years as a prison colony. Wildlife attractions include local birds, penguins, seals, and orcas, many of these species colonizing islands in the Beagle Channel. There are daily bus and boat tours to Harberton, the Bridges family compound. Tours also visit the Les Eclaireurs Lighthouse. Les Eclaireurs is sometimes confused with the \\"Lighthouse at the End of the World\\" (Faro del fin del mundo) made famous by Jules Verne in the novel of the same name; but the latter lies some 200?mi (320?km) east of Ushuaia on Isla de los Estados (Staten Island).\\r\\nUshuaia's industrial sector, led by the Grundig Renacer electronics factory, is among the largest in Patagonia.\\r\\nSince 2007 Ushuaia has hosted the Bienal de Arte Contemporneo del Fin del Mundo (Biennial of Contemporary Art at the End of the World), created and organized by the Patagonia Arte & Desafo Foundation under the rubric \\"South Pole of the Arts, Sciences, and Ecology\\". The Bienal has gathered over one hundred artists from five continents addressing the motto \\"think at the End of the World that another world is possible\\". As a pedagogical project it encourages students at all levels to \\"think about a better world\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nAs in most of Argentina, football is a popular sport in Ushuaia, and in 2010 the TV show FIFA Mundial did a story about the sport's development in this locality. In 2015 Ushuaia hosted the first PATHF Snow Handball Panamerican Championship.[39]\\r\\nA popular sport in Ushuaia is ice hockey, and low temperatures all year long make the city a perfect spot for practicing it outdoors. In 2010 the city opened an outdoor short track and ice hockey Olympic-Size Ice rink (30 by 60 metres (98 by 197 feet)),[40] the first of its kind in South America. After this Argentina became the first South American nation to be upgraded from affiliate to associate member status of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).[41]\\r\\nSince 2005 the Municipality of Ushuaia and the Argentinean Ice Hockey Federation (FAHH) organize the yearly End of the World Cup (Copa del Fin del Mundo) that has gathered ice hockey teams from Ushuaia, Buenos Aires, Punta Arenas and Sao Paulo and includes seven different competitions: one for men, one for women, four junior categories and an international tournament.[42]\\r\\nBeside the local league and the Copa del Fin del Mundo, in 2016 the city hosted the first ice hockey Patagonian Championship, with teams from Ushuaia, Ro Grande and Punta Arenas. After the tournament it was announced a new plan to build a roof over the ice rink.[43]\\r\\nSeveral ski areas are located near Ushuaia including Glacier El Martial (on Martial Mountains) and Cerro Castor. Opened in 1999,[44] Cerro Castor is the southernmost full-fledged ski resort in the world.[45][46] On Cerro Castor, it is possible to ski just 200 metres (660 feet) above sea level. The summit reaches an elevation of 1,003 metres (3,291 feet) above sea level, and consistently cool temperatures allow the longest skiing season in South America. Winter temperatures fluctuate between 0 to ?5?C (32.0 to 23.0?F). It has ten elevation facilities and 28 ski trails for all skill levels. There are cafeterias, mountain huts, a ski school, a first aid room and a forest of beech.[47] Snowboarding, sledding, and snowshoeing are also available at Cerro Castor, in addition to alpine skiing.[48] It is located on the southern side of Cerro Krund,[49] 27 kilometres (17 miles) north of Ushuaia. The ski season is typically between June through October. In 2012 Cerro Castor hosted the FIS Freestyle Slopestyle World Cup, organized by the International Ski Federation (FIS),[50] and in 2015 it hosted the Interski Congress and World Cup, organized by the International Ski Instructors Association, which was its first ever event in the Southern Hemisphere.[51]\\r\\nThe glacier is popular even during the summer months, when the chairlift operates in both directions. Hiking trails lead from the city's edge to the base of the glacier, which has retreated considerably over the past century, as shown in photographs on display at the Antarctic Museum of Ushuaia.[52]\\r\\nThe Valley of Tierra Mayor and the Francisco Jerman Nordic Ski Area, located 20?km and 5?km away from Ushuaia respectively, are popular Cross-Country venues. Since 1986 Tierra Mayor hosts the annual Marchablanca, a 21?km traditional race organized by the Club Andino Ushuaia,[53] and the Ushuaia Loppet, a full distance marathon that is one of the 20 members of the Worldloppet Ski Federation. Usually this race starts the Federation's Marathon Series in August.[54]\\r\\nIn October 2014 the Argentine Olympic Committee (COA) revealed the plan to use the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, to be held in Buenos Aires, as the launchpad for a bid in the near future. The Committee identified Argentina's south-eastern region of Patagonia, which comprises the southern section of the Andes mountains, as a possible location to host the Winter Games.[55] In 2010 it was suggested that Ushuaia would be the main option for a bid.[56]\\r\\nThe city government consists of the three-member Board of Selectmen, a Representative Town Meeting (RTM), a Board of Finance, a Board of Education, a Planning and Zoning Commission (TPZ), and many other politically appointed commissions, boards, and committees.\\r\\nUshuaia has twelve secondary schools, four of which also provide adult education.[57][58] The Colegio Nacional de Ushuaia[59] is one of the newest schools in the city and it was modeled after the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires. Another important secondary school is Colegio Diocesano Monse?or Miguel ngel Alemn, which takes its name after the Monsignor of the same name.\\r\\nThe National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco[60] operates a campus in Ushuaia, with Faculties of Engineering, Economics and Humanities, and Social Sciences.\\r\\nThe National University of Tierra del Fuego, inaugurated in 2010, has its headquarters in Ushuaia.\\r\\nUshuaia has two television stations, channel 11[61] and channel 13.[62]\\r\\nThere are two main newspapers, El Diario del Fin del Mundo[63] and El Diario La Prensa,[64] plus several other minor publications.\\r\\nUshuaia receives regular flights at Ushuaia ÿ Malvinas Argentinas International Airport from El Calafate, Buenos Aires and Santiago, Chile.\\r\\nIn addition to being a vacation destination for local and international tourists, Ushuaia is also the key access point to the Southern Ocean, including subantarctic islands such as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands and Antarctic islands such as the South Orkney Islands and the South Shetland Islands. Its commercial pier is the major port of departure in the world for tourist and scientific expeditions to the Antarctic Peninsula.[citation needed] Cruise ships visiting the Falkland Islands and Antarctica dock at the port, as well as Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, and Celebrity Cruises, which transit between Valparaso, Chile, to Buenos Aires and beyond. Antarpply Expeditions, Global Maritime, Hurtigruten, Lindblad Expeditions, Orient Lines, Quark Expeditions, Regent Seven Seas Cruises, and other passenger and freight lines provide regularly scheduled services between Ushuaia and local seaports and settlements. Australis Cruises provides regular service between Ushuaia and Punta Arenas from September to April. Tourists can also visit Cape Horn (in Chilean waters) by boat or helicopter.\\r\\nThe southern terminus of the Pan-American Highway, which is also the southern end of Argentina National Route 3, is located in Tierra del Fuego National Park.\\r\\nLocated at the corner of Avenida 12 de Octubre and Maip~, the Hospital Gobernador Ernesto M. Campos[65] is one of the big health care centers in Ushuaia; the other one is private and it is called Clnica San Jorge.\\r\\nUshuaia is surrounded by Magellanic subpolar forests. On the hills around the town, the following indigenous trees are found: Drimys winteri (Winter's bark), Maytenus magellanica (Hard-log Mayten) and several species of Nothofagus (Southern Beech). Trees in Ushuaia tend to follow the wind direction, and are therefore called \\"flag-trees\\", for their uni-directional growth pattern.\\r\\nUshua?a, le magazine de l'Extrme was the name of a television program, presented by Nicolas Hulot and broadcast on the French TV channel TF1 from September 1987 to June 1995.[citation needed] The show is known in English as Ushuaia: The Ultimate Adventure, and this language's version was hosted by Perri Peltz and was shown on NBC, CNBC, and international affiliates of the Discovery Channel.[citation needed]. The city was also featured on the American CBS reality television show The Amazing Race in the fourth leg of Season 11.\\r\\nIn 2014, BBC car program Top Gear visited Ushuaia at the conclusion of their \\"Patagonia Special\\", with the intent of constructing a stadium and playing a game of car football there. Before they could do so, however, they were chased out of the city (and subsequently across the border into Chile) by mobs of people angered by an apparent reference to the Falklands War encoded in the registration plate of presenter Jeremy Clarkson (H982 FKL).\\r\\nSeveral scenes in the 2015 film The Revenant, directed by Alejandro Gonzlez I?rritu, were shot in Ushuaia from July through November, 2014.[66][67][68]\\r\\nOn December 29, 2009, the first same-sex couple to marry in Latin America were married in Ushuaia.[71] Although the Civil Code of Argentina at that time did not allow marriage between people of the same sex, Governor Fabiana Ros issued a special decree allowing the couple to wed there.[71] The marriage was annulled when the decree was reversed by Tierra del Fuego's judiciary, since the Civil Code did not support it.[72] Same sex marriage became legal nationwide in Argentina a few months later, on July 15, 2010, after the approval of a gender-neutral bill by the Argentine National Congress.\\r\\nPort\\r\\nHarbor\\r\\nLighthouse\\r\\nCity view\\r\\nPenguins on Martillo Island\\r\\nLos Lobos Island\\r\\nUshuaia is twinned with:","input":"In what country is ushuaia the southernmost city in the world?"},{"output":"Microsoft SQL Server 2016","context":"Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft.

All operations that can be invoked on SQL Server are communicated to it via a Microsoft-defined format, called Tabular Data Stream (TDS). TDS is an application layer protocol, used to transfer data between a database server and a client. Initially designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase SQL Server relational database engine in 1984, and later by Microsoft in Microsoft SQL Server, TDS packets can be encased in other physical transport dependent protocols, including TCP/IP, named pipes, and shared memory.

A SQL Server database can contain a maximum of 231 objects, and can span multiple OS-level files with a maximum file size of 260 bytes (1 exabyte).[6] The data in the database are stored in primary data files with an extension .mdf. Secondary data files, identified with a .ndf extension, are used to allow the data of a single database to be spread across more than one file, and optionally across more than one file system. Log files are identified with the .ldf extension.[6]\\r\\nStorage space allocated to a database is divided into sequentially numbered pages, each 8?KB in size. A page is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. Page type defines the data contained in the page: data stored in the database, index, allocation map which holds information about how pages are allocated to tables and indexes, change map which holds information about the changes made to other pages since last backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed in terms of an extent which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent (\\"uniform extent\\") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects (\\"mixed extent\\"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8?KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8?KB and the row contains varchar or varbinary data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possibly a sequence of pages, called an allocation unit) and replaced with a pointer to the data.[20]\\r\\nFor physical storage of a table, its rows are divided into a series of partitions (numbered 1 to n). The partition size is user defined; by default all rows are in a single partition. A table is split into multiple partitions in order to spread a database over a computer cluster. Rows in each partition are stored in either B-tree or heap structure. If the table has an associated, clustered index to allow fast retrieval of rows, the rows are stored in-order according to their index values, with a B-tree providing the index. The data is in the leaf node of the leaves, and other nodes storing the index values for the leaf data reachable from the respective nodes. If the index is non-clustered, the rows are not sorted according to the index keys. An indexed view has the same storage structure as an indexed table. A table without a clustered index is stored in an unordered heap structure. However, the table may have non-clustered indices to allow fast retrieval of rows. In some situations the heap structure has performance advantages over the clustered structure. Both heaps and B-trees can span multiple allocation units.[21]\\r\\nSQL Server buffers pages in RAM to minimize disk I/O. Any 8?KB page can be buffered in-memory, and the set of all pages currently buffered is called the buffer cache. The amount of memory available to SQL Server decides how many pages will be cached in memory. The buffer cache is managed by the Buffer Manager. Either reading from or writing to any page copies it to the buffer cache. Subsequent reads or writes are redirected to the in-memory copy, rather than the on-disc version. The page is updated on the disc by the Buffer Manager only if the in-memory cache has not been referenced for some time. While writing pages back to disc, asynchronous I/O is used whereby the I/O operation is done in a background thread so that other operations do not have to wait for the I/O operation to complete. Each page is written along with its checksum when it is written. When reading the page back, its checksum is computed again and matched with the stored version to ensure the page has not been damaged or tampered with in the meantime.[22]\\r\\nSQL Server allows multiple clients to use the same database concurrently. As such, it needs to control concurrent access to shared data, to ensure data integritywhen multiple clients update the same data, or clients attempt to read data that is in the process of being changed by another client. SQL Server provides two modes of concurrency control: pessimistic concurrency and optimistic concurrency. When pessimistic concurrency control is being used, SQL Server controls concurrent access by using locks. Locks can be either shared or exclusive. Exclusive lock grants the user exclusive access to the datano other user can access the data as long as the lock is held. Shared locks are used when some data is being readmultiple users can read from data locked with a shared lock, but not acquire an exclusive lock. The latter would have to wait for all shared locks to be released.\\r\\nLocks can be applied on different levels of granularityon entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis on tables. For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the database administrator. While a fine-grained locking system allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources, so it does not automatically yield higher performance. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight mutual exclusion solutionslatches and spinlockswhich are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks to ensure that they do not end up in deadlocksin case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases are to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and roll back the transaction it started.[6] To implement locking, SQL Server contains the Lock Manager. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it.\\r\\nSQL Server also provides the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, which is similar to the multiversion concurrency control used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row is in the process of being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rowsboth of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.[6]\\r\\nThe main mode of retrieving data from a SQL Server database is querying for it. The query is expressed using a variant of SQL called T-SQL, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with Sybase SQL Server due to its legacy. The query declaratively specifies what is to be retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute a query is called a query plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for a query that contains a join statement and a select statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on the results would give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the plan that is expected to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called query optimization and is performed by the query processor itself.[6]\\r\\nSQL Server includes a cost-based query optimizer which tries to optimize on the cost, in terms of the resources it will take to execute the query. Given a query, then the query optimizer looks at the database schema, the database statistics and the system load at that time. It then decides which sequence to access the tables referred in the query, which sequence to execute the operations and what access method to be used to access the tables. For example, if the table has an associated index, whether the index should be used or not: if the index is on a column which is not unique for most of the columns (low \\"selectivity\\"), it might not be worthwhile to use the index to access the data. Finally, it decides whether to execute the query concurrently or not. While a concurrent execution is more costly in terms of total processor time, because the execution is actually split to different processors might mean it will execute faster. Once a query plan is generated for a query, it is temporarily cached. For further invocations of the same query, the cached plan is used. Unused plans are discarded after some time.[6][23]\\r\\nSQL Server also allows stored procedures to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that are stored in the server itself (and not issued by the client application as is the case with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as input parameters, and send back results as output parameters. They can call defined functions, and other stored procedures, including the same stored procedure (up to a set number of times). They can be selectively provided access to. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance.[24] Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary.\\r\\nT-SQL (Transact-SQL) is the secondary means of programming and managing SQL Server. It exposes keywords for the operations that can be performed on SQL Server, including creating and altering database schemas, entering and editing data in the database as well as monitoring and managing the server itself. Client applications that consume data or manage the server will leverage SQL Server functionality by sending T-SQL queries and statements which are then processed by the server and results (or errors) returned to the client application. SQL Server allows it to be managed using T-SQL. For this it exposes read-only tables from which server statistics can be read. Management functionality is exposed via system-defined stored procedures which can be invoked from T-SQL queries to perform the management operation. It is also possible to create linked Servers using T-SQL. Linked servers allow a single query to process operations performed on multiple servers.[25]\\r\\nSQL Native Client is the native client side data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It natively implements support for the SQL Server features including the Tabular Data Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Native Client is used under the hood by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the generic data access layers.[26]\\r\\nOn November 28, 2011, a preview release of the SQL Server ODBC driver for Linux was released.[27]\\r\\nMicrosoft SQL Server 2005 includes a component named SQL CLR (\\"Common Language Runtime\\") via which it integrates with .NET Framework. Unlike most other applications that use .NET Framework, SQL Server itself hosts the .NET Framework runtime, i.e., memory, threading and resource management requirements of .NET Framework are satisfied by SQLOS itself, rather than the underlying Windows operating system. SQLOS provides deadlock detection and resolution services for .NET code as well. With SQL CLR, stored procedures and triggers can be written in any managed .NET language, including C# and VB.NET. Managed code can also be used to define UDT's (user defined types), which can persist in the database. Managed code is compiled to CLI assemblies and after being verified for type safety, registered at the database. After that, they can be invoked like any other procedure.[28] However, only a subset of the Base Class Library is available, when running code under SQL CLR. Most APIs relating to user interface functionality are not available.[28]\\r\\nWhen writing code for SQL CLR, data stored in SQL Server databases can be accessed using the ADO.NET APIs like any other managed application that accesses SQL Server data. However, doing that creates a new database session, different from the one in which the code is executing. To avoid this, SQL Server provides some enhancements to the ADO.NET provider that allows the connection to be redirected to the same session which already hosts the running code. Such connections are called context connections and are set by setting context connection parameter to true in the connection string. SQL Server also provides several other enhancements to the ADO.NET API, including classes to work with tabular data or a single row of data as well as classes to work with internal metadata about the data stored in the database. It also provides access to the XML features in SQL Server, including XQuery support. These enhancements are also available in T-SQL Procedures in consequence of the introduction of the new XML Datatype (query,value,nodes functions).[29]\\r\\nSQL Server also includes an assortment of add-on services. While these are not essential for the operation of the database system, they provide value added services on top of the core database management system. These services either run as a part of some SQL Server component or out-of-process as Windows Service and presents their own API to control and interact with them.\\r\\nUsed inside an instance, programming environment. For cross-instance applications, Service Broker communicates over TCP/IP and allows the different components to be synchronized, via exchange of messages. The Service Broker, which runs as a part of the database engine, provides a reliable messaging and message queuing platform for SQL Server applications.[30]\\r\\nSQL Server Replication Services are used by SQL Server to replicate and synchronize database objects, either in entirety or a subset of the objects present, across replication agents, which might be other database servers across the network, or database caches on the client side. Lulla follows a publisher/subscriber model, i.e., the changes are sent out by one database server (\\"publisher\\") and are received by others (\\"subscribers\\"). SQL Server supports three different types of replication:[31]\\r\\nSQL Server Analysis Services adds OLAP and data mining capabilities for SQL Server databases. The OLAP engine supports MOLAP, ROLAP and HOLAP storage modes for data. Analysis Services supports the XML for Analysis standard as the underlying communication protocol. The cube data can be accessed using MDX and LINQ[35] queries.[36] Data mining specific functionality is exposed via the DMX query language. Analysis Services includes various algorithmsDecision trees, clustering algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, time series analysis, sequence clustering algorithm, linear and logistic regression analysis, and neural networksfor use in data mining.[37]\\r\\nSQL Server Reporting Services is a report generation environment for data gathered from SQL Server databases. It is administered via a web interface. Reporting services features a web services interface to support the development of custom reporting applications. Reports are created as RDL files.[38]\\r\\nReports can be designed using recent versions of Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio.NET 2003, 2005, and 2008)[39] with Business Intelligence Development Studio, installed or with the included Report Builder. Once created, RDL files can be rendered in a variety of formats,[40][41] including Excel, PDF, CSV, XML, BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF,[42] and HTML Web Archive.\\r\\nOriginally introduced as a post-release add-on for SQL Server 2000,[43] Notification Services was bundled as part of the Microsoft SQL Server platform for the first and only time with SQL Server 2005.[44][45] SQL Server Notification Services is a mechanism for generating data-driven notifications, which are sent to Notification Services subscribers. A subscriber registers for a specific event or transaction (which is registered on the database server as a trigger); when the event occurs, Notification Services can use one of three methods to send a message to the subscriber informing about the occurrence of the event. These methods include SMTP, SOAP, or by writing to a file in the filesystem.[46] Notification Services was discontinued by Microsoft with the release of SQL Server 2008 in August 2008, and is no longer an officially supported component of the SQL Server database platform.\\r\\nSQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) provides ETL capabilities for SQL Server for data import, data integration and data warehousing needs. Integration Services includes GUI tools to build workflows such as extracting data from various sources, querying data, transforming dataincluding aggregation, de-duplication, de-/normalization and merging of dataand then exporting the transformed data into destination databases or files.[47]\\r\\nSQL Server Full Text Search service is a specialized indexing and querying service for unstructured text stored in SQL Server databases. The full text search index can be created on any column with character based text data. It allows for words to be searched for in the text columns. While it can be performed with the SQL LIKE operator, using SQL Server Full Text Search service can be more efficient. Full allows for inexact matching of the source string, indicated by a Rank value which can range from 0 to 1000a higher rank means a more accurate match. It also allows linguistic matching (\\"inflectional search\\"), i.e., linguistic variants of a word (such as a verb in a different tense) will also be a match for a given word (but with a lower rank than an exact match). Proximity searches are also supported, i.e., if the words searched for do not occur in the sequence they are specified in the query but are near each other, they are also considered a match. T-SQL exposes special operators that can be used to access the FTS capabilities.[48][49]\\r\\nThe Full Text Search engine is divided into two processes: the Filter Daemon process (msftefd.exe) and the Search process (msftesql.exe). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the indexer (that creates the full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The indexer scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use iFilters to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a Microsoft Word document is stored as an unstructured binary file in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the indexer. The indexer filters out noise words, i.e., words like A, And etc., which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an inverted index is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a Gatherer component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the indexer in case of updates.[50]\\r\\nWhen a full text query is received by the SQL Server query processor, it is handed over to the FTS query processor in the Search process. The FTS query processor breaks up the query into the constituent words, filters out the noise words, and uses an inbuilt thesaurus to find out the linguistic variants for each word. The words are then queried against the inverted index and a rank of their accurateness is computed. The results are returned to the client via the SQL Server process.[50]\\r\\nSQLCMD is a command line application that comes with Microsoft SQL Server, and exposes the management features of SQL Server. It allows SQL queries to be written and executed from the command prompt. It can also act as a scripting language to create and run a set of SQL statements as a script. Such scripts are stored as a .sql file, and are used either for management of databases or to create the database schema during the deployment of a database.\\r\\nSQLCMD was introduced with SQL Server 2005 and this continues with SQL Server 2012, 2014 and 2016. Its predecessor for earlier versions was OSQL and ISQL, which is functionally equivalent as it pertains to TSQL execution, and many of the command line parameters are identical, although SQLCMD adds extra versatility.\\r\\nMicrosoft Visual Studio includes native support for data programming with Microsoft SQL Server. It can be used to write and debug code to be executed by SQL CLR. It also includes a data designer that can be used to graphically create, view or edit database schemas. Queries can be created either visually or using code. SSMS 2008 onwards, provides intellisense for SQL queries as well.\\r\\nSQL Server Management Studio is a GUI tool included with SQL Server 2005 and later for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server. The tool includes both script editors and graphical tools that work with objects and features of the server.[51] SQL Server Management Studio replaces Enterprise Manager as the primary management interface for Microsoft SQL Server since SQL Server 2005. A version of SQL Server Management Studio is also available for SQL Server Express Edition, for which it is known as SQL Server Management Studio Express (SSMSE).[52]\\r\\nA central feature of SQL Server Management Studio is the Object Explorer, which allows the user to browse, select, and act upon any of the objects within the server.[53] It can be used to visually observe and analyze query plans and optimize the database performance, among others.[54] SQL Server Management Studio can also be used to create a new database, alter any existing database schema by adding or modifying tables and indexes, or analyze performance. It includes the query windows which provide a GUI based interface to write and execute queries.[6]\\r\\nBusiness Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) is the IDE from Microsoft used for developing data analysis and Business Intelligence solutions utilizing the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services, Reporting Services and Integration Services. It is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment but is customized with the SQL Server services-specific extensions and project types, including tools, controls and projects for reports (using Reporting Services), Cubes and data mining structures (using Analysis Services).[55] For SQL Server 2012 and later, this IDE has been renamed SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).","input":"What is the latest version of sql server?"},{"output":"eleven","context":"","input":"How many players on a football team nfl?"},{"output":"the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago","context":"A. f. fulgens F. Cuvier, 1825\\r\\nA. f. styani Thomas, 1902[2][3]\\r\\nThe red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.[1] It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.\\r\\nThe red panda has been classified as endangered by the IUCN, because its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries.[1][4]\\r\\nThe red panda is the only living species of the genus Ailurus and the family Ailuridae. It has been previously placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of phylogenetic analysis provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family, Ailuridae, which is part of the superfamily Musteloidea, along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families.[5] Two subspecies are recognized.[3] It is not closely related to the giant panda, which is a basal ursid.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head and body length of a red panda measures 50 to 64?cm (20 to 25?in), and its tail is 28 to 59?cm (11 to 23?in). Males weigh 3.7 to 6.2?kg (8.2 to 13.7?lb) and females 3 to 6.0?kg (6.6 to 13.2?lb).[6][7][8] They have long, soft, reddish-brown fur on the upper parts, blackish fur on the lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and robust cranio-dental features. The light face has white badges similar to those of a raccoon, but each individual can have distinctive markings. Their roundish heads have medium-sized upright ears, black noses, and blackish eyes. Their long, bushy tails with six alternating transverse ochre rings provide balance and excellent camouflage against their habitat of moss- and lichen-covered trees. The legs are black and short with thick fur on the soles of the paws. This fur serves as thermal insulation on snow-covered or icy surfaces and conceals scent glands, which are also present on the anus.[9]\\r\\nThe red panda is specialized as a bamboo feeder with strong, curved and sharp semi-retractile claws[6] standing inward for grasping narrow tree branches, leaves, and fruit. Like the giant panda, it has a false thumb, which is an extension of the wrist bone. When descending a tree head-first, the red panda rotates its ankle to control its descent, one of the few climbing species to do so.[10]\\r\\nThe red panda is endemic to the temperate forests of the Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east.[11] Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China. Its range includes southern Tibet, Sikkim and Assam in India, Bhutan, the northern mountains of Burma, and in south-western China, in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan. It may also live in south-west Tibet and northern Arunachal Pradesh, but this has not been documented. Locations with the highest density of red pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been a refuge for a variety of endemic species in the Pleistocene. The distribution range of the red panda should be considered disjunct, rather than continuous.[6] A disjunct population inhabits the Meghalaya Plateau of north-eastern India.[12]\\r\\nDuring a survey in the 1970s, signs of red pandas were found in Nepal's Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.[13] Their presence was confirmed in spring 2007 when four red pandas were sighted at elevations ranging from 3,220 to 3,610?m (10,560 to 11,840?ft).[14] The species' westernmost limit is in Rara National Park located farther west of the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.[15] Their presence was confirmed in 2008.[16]\\r\\nThe red panda lives between 2,200 and 4,800?m (7,200 and 15,700?ft) altitude, inhabiting areas of moderate temperature between 10 and 25?C (50 and 77?F) with little annual change. It prefers mountainous mixed deciduous and conifer forests, especially with old trees and dense understories of bamboo.[6][11]\\r\\nThe red panda population in Sichuan Province is larger and more stable than the Yunnan population, suggesting a southward expansion from Sichuan into Yunnan in the Holocene.[17]\\r\\nThe red panda has become extirpated from the Chinese provinces of Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Qinghai.[18]\\r\\nDistribution of the red panda is disjointed, with two extant subspecies:\\r\\nA. f. styani has been described by Thomas in 1902 based on one skull from a specimen collected in Sichuan.[2] Pocock distinguished A. f. styani from A. f. fulgens by its longer winter coat and greater blackness of the pelage, bigger skull, more strongly curved forehead, and more robust teeth. His description is based on skulls and skins collected in Sichuan, Myitkyina close to the border of Yunnan, and Upper Burma.[9]\\r\\nStyan's red panda is supposedly larger and darker in color than the Western member of the species, but with considerable variation in both subspecies, and some individuals may be brown or yellowish brown rather than red.[11]\\r\\nThe Brahmaputra River is often considered the natural division between the two subspecies, where it makes a curve around the eastern end of the Himalayas, although some authors suggest A. f. fulgens extends farther eastward, into China.\\r\\nThe red panda is territorial; it is solitary except during mating season. The species is generally quiet except for some twittering, tweeting, and whistling communication sounds. It has been reported to be both nocturnal and crepuscular, sleeping on tree branches or in tree hollows during the day and increasing its activity in the late afternoon and early evening hours. It sleeps stretched out on a branch with legs dangling when it is hot, and curled up with its tail over the face when it is cold.[6] This animal is very heat-sensitive, with an optimal well-being temperature between 17 and 25?C (63 and 77?F), and cannot tolerate temperatures over 25?C (77?F)[citation needed].\\r\\nShortly after waking, red pandas clean their fur somewhat like a cat would, licking their front paws and then rubbing their backs, torsos, and sides. They also rub their backs and bellies along the sides of trees or rocks. Then they patrol their territories, marking with urine and a weak musk-smelling secretion from their anal glands. They search for food running along the ground or through the trees. Red pandas may use their forepaws alternately to bring food to their mouths or place food directly into their mouths.[6]\\r\\nPredators of the red panda include the snow leopard, mustelids, and humans. If they feel threatened or sense danger, they may try to escape by climbing a rock column or tree. If they can no longer flee, they stand on their hind legs to make themselves appear larger and use the sharp claws on their front paws to defend themselves. A red panda, Futa, became a visitor attraction in Japan for his ability to stand upright for ten seconds at a time[citation needed]. (See also: facultative biped)\\r\\nRed pandas are excellent climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, maple and mulberry leaves, and bark and fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.[6]\\r\\nLike the giant panda, they cannot digest cellulose, so they must consume a large volume of bamboo to survive. Their diets consist of about two-thirds bamboo, but they also eat mushrooms, roots, acorns, lichens, and grasses. Occasionally, they supplement their diets with fish and insects. They do little more than eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.[20][21]\\r\\nBamboo shoots are more easily digested than leaves, exhibiting the highest digestibility in summer and autumn, intermediate digestibility in the spring, and lowest digestibility in the winter. These variations correlate with the nutrient contents in the bamboo. Red pandas process bamboo poorly, especially the cellulose and cell wall components. This implies microbial digestion plays only a minor role in their digestive strategy. To survive on this poor-quality diet, they have to eat the high-quality sections of the bamboo plant, such as the tender leaves and shoots, in large quantities, over 1.5?kg (3.3?lb) of fresh leaves and 4?kg (8.8?lb) of fresh shoots daily. This food passes through the digestive tract fairly rapidly (about 2ÿ4 hr) so as to maximize daily nutrient intake.[22] Red pandas can taste artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame, and are the only nonprimates known to be able to do so.[23]\\r\\nRed pandas are able to reproduce at around 18 months of age, and are fully mature at two to three years. Adults rarely interact in the wild except to mate. Both sexes may mate with more than one partner during the mating season from mid-January to early March.[24] A few days before birth, females begin to collect material, such as brushwood, grass, and leaves, to build a nest, which is normally located in a hollow tree or a rock crevice. After a gestation period of 112 to 158 days, the female gives birth in mid-June to late July to one to four (usually 1ÿ2) blind and deaf cubs weighing 110 to 130?g (3.9 to 4.6?oz) each.[6]\\r\\nAfter birth, the mother cleans the cubs, and can then recognize each by its smell. At first, she spends 60% to 90% of her time with the cubs. After the first week, the mother starts spending more time outside the nest, returning every few hours to nurse and groom the cubs. She moves the young frequently among several nests, all of which she keeps clean. The cubs start to open their eyes at about 18 days of age. By about 90 days, they achieve full adult fur and coloring, and begin to venture out of the nest. They also start eating solid foods at this point, weaning at around six to eight months of age. The cubs stay with their mother until the next litter is born in the following summer. Males rarely help raise the young, and only if they live in pairs or in small groups.[6]\\r\\nA red panda's average lifespan is between eight and 10 years, but individuals have been known to reach 15 years[citation needed].\\r\\nThe primary threats to red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, competition with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and deforestation resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The relative importance of these factors is different in each region, and is not well understood.[11] For instance, in India, the biggest threat seems to be habitat loss followed by poaching, while in China, the biggest threat seems to be hunting and poaching.[1] A 40% decrease in red panda populations has been reported in China over the last 50 years, and populations in western Himalayan areas are considered to be lower.[18]\\r\\nDeforestation can inhibit the spread of red pandas and exacerbate the natural population subdivision by topography and ecology, leading to severe fragmentation of the remaining wild population. Fewer than 40 animals in four separate groups share resources with humans in Nepal's Langtang National Park, where only 6% of 1,710?km2 (660?sq?mi) is preferred red panda habitat. Although direct competition for food with domestic livestock is not significant, livestock can depress bamboo growth by trampling.[25]\\r\\nSmall groups of animals with little opportunity for exchange between them face the risk of inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.[11]\\r\\nIn south-west China, red pandas are hunted for their fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails, from which hats are produced. In these areas, the fur is often used for local cultural ceremonies. In weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. The \\"good-luck charm\\" red panda-tail hats are also used by local newly-weds.[18] This practice may be quite old, as the red panda seems to be depicted in a 13th-century Chinese pen-and-ink scroll showing a hunting scene. Little or no mention of the red panda is made in the culture and folklore of Nepal.[26]\\r\\nIn the past, red pandas were captured and sold to zoos. Angela Glatston reported she had personally handled 350 red pandas in 17 years.[27]\\r\\nDue to CITES, this zoo harvest has decreased substantially in recent years, but poaching continues, and red pandas are often sold to private collectors at exorbitant prices. In some parts of Nepal and India, red pandas are kept as pets.[28]\\r\\nThe red panda has a naturally low birth rate (usually one single or twin birth per year), and a high death rate in the wild[citation needed].\\r\\nThe red panda is listed in CITES Appendix I.[29] The species has been classified as endangered in the IUCN Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend; only about half of the total area of potential habitat of 142,000?km2 (55,000?sq?mi) is actually being used by the species. Due to their shy and secretive nature, and their largely nocturnal habits, observation of red pandas is difficult. Therefore, population figures in the wild are determined by population density estimates and not direct counts.[1]\\r\\nWorldwide population estimates range from fewer than 2,500[24] to between 16,000 and 20,000 individuals.[12] In 1999, the total population in China was estimated at between 3,000 and 7,000 individuals.[18] In 2001, the wild population in India was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 individuals.[12] Estimates for Nepal indicate only a few hundred individuals.[30] No records from Bhutan or Burma exist.\\r\\nReliable population numbers are hard to find, partly because other animals have been mistaken for the red panda. For instance, one report from Burma stated that red pandas were still fairly common in some areas; however, the accompanying photographic proof of the \\"red panda\\" is in fact a species of civet.[31]\\r\\nThe red panda is protected in all range countries, and hunting is illegal.[1] Beyond this, conservation efforts are highly variable between countries:\\r\\nA community-managed forest in Ilam District of eastern Nepal is home to 15 red pandas which generate household income through tourism activities, including homestays. Villagers in the high-altitude areas of Arunachal Pradesh have formed the Pangchen Red Panda Conservation Alliance comprising five villages with a community-conserved forest area of 200?km2 (77?sq?mi) at an altitude of 2,500?m (8,200?ft) to over 4,000?m (13,000?ft).[33]\\r\\nThe red panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had occurred in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide.[34] By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone.[35] As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies A. f. fulgens were kept in 173 institutions[36] and 306 individuals of subspecies A. f. styani were kept in 81 institutions.[37]\\r\\nThe international studbook is currently managed at the Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands. In cooperation with the International Red Panda Management Group, they coordinate the Species Survival Plan in North America, the European Endangered Species Programme in Europe, and other captive-breeding programs in Australia, India, Japan, and China.[37][38] In 2009, Sarah Glass, curator of red pandas and special exhibits at the Knoxville Zoo in Knoxville, Tennessee, was appointed as coordinator for the North American Red Panda Species Survival Plan. The Knoxville Zoo has the largest number of captive red panda births in the Western Hemisphere (101 as of August 2011). Only the Rotterdam Zoo has had more captive births worldwide.[36][37]\\r\\nThe Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling, India, successfully released four captive-bred red pandas to the wild in August and November 2003.[38]\\r\\nThe most often cited example of keeping red pandas as pets is the case of former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi. Pandas were presented to her family as a gift, and they were then housed in \\"a special tree house\\".[39]\\r\\nThe taxonomic classification of the red panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist Frdric Cuvier initially described the red panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the raccoon (Procyonidae), though he gave it the genus name Ailurus, (from Ancient Greek ϫ??, \\"cat\\"), based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective fulgens (\\"shining\\").[40]\\r\\nAt various times, it has been placed in the Procyonidae, Ursidae, with Ailuropoda (giant panda) in the Ailuropodinae (until this family was moved into the Ursidae), and into its own family, the Ailuridae. This uncertainty comes from difficulty in determining whether certain characteristics of Ailurus are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.[6]\\r\\nEvidence based on the fossil record, serology, karyology, behavior, anatomy, and reproduction reflect closer affinities with Procyonidae than Ursidae. However, ecological and foraging specializations and distinct geographical distribution in relation to modern procyonids support classification in the separate family Ailuridae.[3][6][41]\\r\\nRecent molecular systematic DNA research also places the red panda into its own family, Ailuridae, a part of the broad superfamily Musteloidea that also includes the skunk, raccoon, and weasel families.[5][41][42]\\r\\nIt is not a bear, nor closely related to the giant panda, nor a raccoon, nor a lineage of uncertain affinities. Rather it is a basal lineage of musteloid, with a long history of independence from its closest relatives (skunks, raccoons, and otters/weasels/badgers).\\r\\nThe two subspecies are A. f. fulgens and A. f. styani. However, the name Ailurus fulgens refulgens is sometimes incorrectly used for A. f. styani. This stems from a lapsus made by Henri Milne-Edwards in his 1874 paper \\"Recherches pour servir  l'histoire naturelle des mammifres comprenant des considrations sur la classification de ces animaux\\",[43] making A. f. refulgens a nomen nudum.[9][19] The most recent edition of Mammal Species of the World still shows the subspecies as A. f. refulgens.[3] This has been corrected in more recent works, including A guide to the Mammals of China[44] and Handbook of the Mammals of the World, Volume 1: Carnivores.[45]\\r\\nThe red panda is considered a living fossil and only distantly related to the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally more closely related to the other members of the superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.\\r\\nFossils of the extinct red panda Parailurus anglicus have been unearthed from China in the east to Britain in the west.[46] In 1977, a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia.[47] In 2004, a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5ÿ7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa.[46][48] Additional fossils of Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012.[49][50] The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played a large role in the overall ecosystem of the area.\\r\\nThe discovery in Spain of the postcranial remains of Simocyon batalleri, a Miocene relative to the red panda, supports a sister-group relationship between red pandas and bears. The discovery suggests the red panda's \\"false thumb\\" was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion? independent of the giant panda's adaptation to manipulate bamboo? one of the most dramatic cases of convergent evolution among vertebrates.[51]\\r\\nThe first known written record of the red panda occurs in a 13th-century Chinese scroll depicting a hunting scene between hunters and the red panda.[26][34]\\r\\nMajor General Thomas Hardwickes 1821 presentation of an article titled \\"Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains\\" at the Linnean Society in London is usually regarded as the moment the red panda became a bona fide species in Western science. Hardwicke proposed the name \\"wha\\" and explained: \\"It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word Wha, often repeating the same: hence is derived one of the local names by which it is known. It is also called Chitwa.\\" Hardwicke's paper was not published until 1827, by which time Frdric Cuvier had published his description and a figure. Hardwicke's originally proposed taxonomic name was removed from the 1827 publication of his paper with his permission, and naming credit is now given to Cuvier.[52]\\r\\nFrdric Cuvier had received the specimen he described from his brother's stepson, Alfred Duvaucel, who had sent it \\"from the mountains north of India\\".[53] He was the first to use both the binomial name Ailurus fulgens and the vernacular name panda in his description of the species published in 1825 in Histoire naturelle des mammifres.[54][55] Ailurus is adopted from the ancient Greek word ϫ?? (ailouros), meaning \\"cat\\".[56] The specific epithet fulgens is Latin for \\"shining, bright\\".[57] Panda is a Roman goddess of peace and travellers, who was called upon before starting a difficult journey.[58] Whether this is the origin of the French vernacular name panda remains uncertain. Later publications claim the name was adopted from a Himalayan language.\\r\\nIn 1847, Hodgson described a red panda under the name Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since the description of the two agree very closely. He subordinated both types to the Himalayan red panda subspecies Ailurus fulgens fulgens.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red panda's local names differ from place to place. The Lepcha call it sak nam. In Nepal, it is called bhalu biralo (bear-cat) and habre. The Sherpa people of Nepal and Sikkim call it ye niglva ponva and wah donka.[59] The word w?? is Sunuwari meaning bear; in Tamang language, a small, red bear is called twm.[60] In the Kanchenjunga region of eastern Nepal, the Limbus know red pandas as kaala (literally \\"dark\\") because of their underside pelage; villagers of Tibetan origin call them hoptongar.[61]\\r\\nAdditionally, Pocock lists the vernacular names ye and niglya ponya (Nepal); thokya and thongwa (Limbu); oakdonga or wakdonka and woker (Bhotia); saknam sunam (Lepcha).[9] Niglya may originate from the Nepali word ?????? ni?lo or n?glo, a small bamboo, Arundinaria intermedia, but also refers to a kind of small leopard, or cat-bear.[62] The word p܇nya may originate from the Nepali ????? paj (\\"claw\\") or ????? pa?j (\\"paw\\").[63] Niglya p܇nya may translate to \\"bamboo claw/paw\\". Niglya p܇nya, nyala ponga,[64] and poonya are also said to mean \\"eater of bamboo\\".[65] The name panda could originate from panj.[66]\\r\\nIn modern Chinese, the red panda is called xi?oxi܇ngmo (ւV/ւ?, lesser or small panda),[67] or \`V/S? (h܇ngxi܇ngmo, red panda).[68] In contrast, the giant panda is called dxi܇ngmo (΂V/΂?, giant or big panda), or simply xi܇ngmo (V/?, panda, literally bear-cat).\\r\\nIn English, the red panda is also called lesser panda (since it is smaller than the giant panda),[69] though \\"red\\" is more commonly used nowadays. As it was known in the West decades before the giant panda, initially it was the red panda that was simply called \\"panda\\".[70][71] When distinction became necessary, the red panda was still considered the true panda and common panda.[69][72]\\r\\nOther English names used in the past include fire fox, fire cat, red cat, fox bear, bright panda, and Himalayan raccoon.[73][34]\\r\\nMany other languages also use \\"red\\" or variations of \\"shining/gold\\" or \\"lesser/small\\" in their names for this species. For instance, ۿ־ Ť in Bulgarian, panda roux in French, panda rojo in Spanish, and Roter Panda in German all mean \\"red panda\\". Since at least as far back as 1855, one of its French names has been panda clatant (shining panda).[74] In Finnish, it is called kultapanda (gold panda).\\r\\nVariations of \\"lesser panda\\" occur in French petit panda (small panda), German Kleiner Panda (small panda), Spanish panda menor (lesser panda), Dutch kleine panda (small panda), Russian  Ť (malaya panda, \\"small panda\\"), Korean ???? (aeki panda, \\"baby panda\\"), and Japanese ɼĸ (ress panda, a transliteration of English \\"lesser panda\\")[citation needed].\\r\\nThe red panda was recognized as the state animal of Sikkim in the early 1990s,[75] and was the mascot of the Darjeeling Tea Festival.[26]\\r\\nIn 2005, Babu, a male red panda at Birmingham Nature Centre in Birmingham, England, escaped[76] and briefly became a media celebrity,[76][77] before being recaptured. He was subsequently voted \\"Brummie of the Year\\", the first animal to receive this honor.[76][77] Rusty, a male red panda at the National Zoo in Washington, DC, similarly attracted media attention when he briefly escaped in 2013.[78][79]\\r\\nThe name of the open-source Firefox web browser is said to have been derived from a nickname of the red panda: \\"fire fox\\".[80][81]\\r\\nAn anthropomorphic red panda was featured as Master Shifu, the kungfu teacher, in the 2008 film Kung Fu Panda, and its sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 in 2011 and Kung Fu Panda 3 in 2016.[82] The red panda Futa inspired the character of Pabu, the so-called \\"fire ferret\\" animal companion (primarily of Bolin), in the U.S. animated TV series The Legend of Korra.[83]","input":"When did the red panda first appear on earth?"},{"output":"Fifty","context":"","input":"How many flags are around the base of the washington monument?"},{"output":"Washington County","context":"Providence St. Vincent Medical Center, is a non-profit, acute care teaching hospital in West Haven-Sylvan in the Portland metropolitan area in the state of Oregon, United States.

Situated in the historical area of Caithness, it is the northernmost town on the British mainland.\\r\\nIt lies at the junction of the north-south A9 road and the west-east A836 road, connected to Bridge of Forss in the west and Castletown in the east. The 34 miles (55?km) River Thurso flows through the town and into Thurso Bay and the Pentland Firth. The river estuary serves as a small harbour. At the 2011 Census, Thurso had a population of 7,933. The larger Thurso civil parish including the town and the surrounding countryside had a population of 9,112.\\r\\nThurso functioned as an important Norse port, and later traded with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century. A thriving fishing centre, Thurso also had a reputation for its linen-cloth and tanning activities. As of 2015[update] the Dounreay Nuclear power plant, although decommissioned at the end of the 20th century, employs a significant number of the local population. The Category-A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) is one of the oldest churches in Scotland, dating to at least 1125. The current church, St Andrew's and St Peter's, was built in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style.\\r\\nThe town contains the main campus of North Highland College and Thurso High School, the northernmost secondary school on the British mainland, which was established in 1958. Thurso Castle, built in 1872, is in ruins. Thurso is home to the football (soccer) team, Thurso FC, established in 2008, which play in the North Caledonian League, and the rugby teams Caithness Crushers and Caithness RFC.\\r\\nThurso railway station, opened in 1874, was the most northern station on the Sutherland and Caithness Railway. The nearby port of Scrabster provides ferry services to the Orkney Islands; the Northlink ferry (MV?Hamnavoe) operates between Scrabster and Stromness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally Thurso was known by the Celtic name of tarvodubron meaning \\"bull water\\" or \\"bull river\\"; similarly Dunnet Head was tarvedunum standing for \\"bull fort\\" and the name of the town name may have its roots there. Norse influence altered its name to Thjors, then Thors, based on the deity of Thor and translating as the place on Thors River.[2][3]\\r\\nThe local Scots name, Thursa,[4] derives from the Norse, as does the modern Scottish Gaelic Inbhir Thersa. Inbhir means a river mouth, and is generally found as \\"Inver\\" in many anglicised names. It is possible that there was also a pre-Norse Gaelic name as well, as \\"tarvodunum\\" is cognate with the modern Gaelic terms, \\"tarbh\\" (bull),[5] \\"dobhran\\" and \\"dun\\".\\r\\nThurso's history stretches back to at least the era of Norse Orcadian rule in Caithness, which ended conclusively in 1266. Neolithic horned cairns found on nearby Shebster Hill, which were used for burials and rituals, date back about 5000 years.[6] The town was an important Norse port, and has a later history of trade with ports throughout northern Europe until the 19th century. In 1330 Scotland's standard unit of weight was brought in line with that of Thurso at the decree of King David II of Scotland, a measure of the town's economic importance.[7] Old St Peter's Kirk is said to date from circa 1220 and the time of Caithness Bishop Gilbert Murray, who died in 1245.[8]\\r\\nIn 1649, the Irish, led by Donald Macalister Mullach, attacked Thurso and were chased off by the residents, headed by Sir James Sinclair. One of the locals, a servant of Sinclair was said to have killed Mullach by \\"cutting a button from his master's coat and firing it from a musket\\".[9] In 1811, the parish had 592 houses with a population of 3462.[10] Following the passage into law of the 1845 Poor Law Act,[11] a combination poorhouse was constructed; work commenced in 1854 and was completed by 1856. The building, which had a capacity to house 149 inmates,[12] was on a five acres (2.0?ha) site to the west of Thurso Road and provided poor relief for Thurso and the parishes of Bower, Canisbay, Dunnet, Halkirk, Olrig, Reay and Watten.[13] Many of the poorhouses in Scotland were under used,[14] and by 1924 the building had been unoccupied for several years so was sold; it was later utilised as housing but by 2001 was again abandoned.[13]\\r\\nMuch of the town is a planned 19th-century development. In 1906, a new Royal National Lifeboat Institution boathouse and slipway was inaugurated near Scrabster Harbour. A fire on 10 December 1956 destroyed the building and its 47ft Watson-class lifeboat and a new building and boat was built, launched the following year.[15] A new lifeboat, named \\"The Three Sisters\\" was inaugurated in 1971 by The Queen Mother. A major expansion occurred in the mid-20th century when the Dounreay nuclear power plant was established at Dounreay in 1955,[16] 9 miles (14?km) to the west of the town. The arrival of workers related to the power station caused a three-fold increase in the population of Thurso; the 1951 census gave a figure of 3,000 but this had swelled to 9,000 by 1971.[17] This led to around 1,700 new houses being built in Thurso and nearby Castletown, a mixture of local authority housing blended with private houses and flats built by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.[17] Decommissioned at the end of the 20th century, it is estimated the site will not be cleared of all the waste until the 2070s, so will continue to provide employment.[18]\\r\\nThurso is also the name of the viscountcy held by the Sinclair family in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.[19] Thurso hosted the National Md in 2010, which was the first time this festival of Gaelic language and culture had been held so far north.[20][21]\\r\\nThurso has history as a burgh of barony dating from 1633 when it was established by Charles I.[22] In 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, the local government burgh was merged into the Caithness district of the two-tier Highland region. In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the district was abolished and the region became a unitary council area. From 1996 until 2007, the town of Thurso was covered by two or three wards, each electing one councillor by the first past the post system of election. In 2007, a single Thurso ward was created to elect three councillors by the single transferable vote system.[23] . In 2017 the Thurso ward was absorbed into a new multi member ward along with the Western portion of Landward Caithness [24], the new ward, named Thurso and Northwest Caithness, was contested for the first time in the Highland Council Election, 2017. The incumbent councillors are Cllr Matthew Reiss (Independent), Cllr Struan Mackie (Scottish Conservative), Donnie Mackay (Independent) and Karl Rosie (Scottish National Party).\\r\\nElecting four members to the new ward, it is one of two within the Highland Council's Caithness ward management area and one of seven within the council's Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross corporate management area.[25]\\r\\nThurso Community Council was created in 1975 when the burgh was abolished.[15] The community council is not a tier of local government, but it is recognised as a level of statutory representation. The community council represents an area which is somewhat smaller than that represented by ward councillors. The ward area also includes parts of other community council areas.\\r\\nThurso is the most northerly town on the British mainland, situated on the northern coastline overlooking the Orkney Islands.[26] It is situated at the northern terminus of the A9 road, the main road linking Caithness with the south of Scotland, and is 19.5 miles (31.4?km) west of John o' Groats and 20.4 miles (32.8?km) northwest of Wick, the closest town.[27] Thurso railway station is the most northerly location served by Britain's rail network, which links the town directly with Wick, the county town of Caithness, and with Inverness. Thurso is bordered by the parishes of Olrig and Bower to the east, Halkirk to the south, and Reay to the west, and stretches from Holburn Head and Crosskirk Bay in the west to Dunnet Head and Dunnet Bay in the east.[28] It lies as far north as the Alaskan capital of Juneau.\\r\\nThe 34 miles (55?km) River Thurso, reputable for its salmon fishing,[29] flows through the town and into Thurso Bay and the Pentland Firth.[30] The river estuary serves as a small harbour. Thurso has a fine harbour and beach and looks out over the Pentland Firth to the Orkney island of Hoy and the towering Old Man of Hoy (a stack of rock standing out from the main island).[31]\\r\\nThurso has a cool oceanic climate, similar weather to the Scottish Highlands, Iceland, Alaska and the Scandinavian West Coast of Norway. The highest temperature recorded was 25?C (July 1995) and the lowest -11?C (December 2010). Similar parallels in nearby Sweden have much more continental climates with much more extensive heat and coldwaves, further demonstrating the moderating effect of the North Atlantic. The moderate winter climate is some 30?C warmer than marine areas around Hudson Bay in Canada on similar latitudes.\\r\\nHistorically, Thurso was known for its production of linen cloth and had a thriving tanning business.[10] Fishing has always been of major significance in the running of the local economy, and the Thurso Shipowner's Association overlooked much of the shipping activity.[33] The port of Scrabster lies about 1?1?2 miles (2.4?km) to the west of the estuary of the River Thurso, and plays a significant role in the white fish industry in Scotland.[34] Scrabster has deep water in the shelter of Holborn Head. The harbour includes a berth for the MV Hamnavoe, a roll-on/roll-off ferry operated by Northlink linking the Scottish mainland with Stromness on Orkney. There is also a large fishmart and the local lifeboat is stationed there too. From June 2007, a summer-only weekly ferry service operated by the Faroese company Smyril Line reopened,[35] connecting Scrabster with the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, but has now been discontinued.[36]\\r\\nThurso boasts a small museum, Caithness Horizons, several hotels and bars, a surf shop/cafe stocking famous brands, and a small skatepark. There is also a sizeable British Telecom call centre and a plant making lithium-ion batteries for the MoD on the west side of the town, which along with the Dounreay Nuclear power plant, provide a high level of employment in Caithness. On 12 January 2010, approval was granted for the Baillie wind farm near Thurso which will feature 21 turbines and supply 52.5?MW, enough for 25,000 homes.[37]\\r\\nThe Category A listed ruined Old St Peter's Church (St. Peter's Kirk) is one of the older churches in Scotland, dated to at least 1125, and at one time it was the principal church for the county, administered by the Bishops of Caithness.[9] The church held hearings against criminal activity and determined how those caught should be punished. In 1701, a woman who had a relationship with a Dutch sailor had her head shaved and was publicly shamed, paraded through the town by the local hangman.[9]\\r\\nThe current church, St Andrew's and St Peter's, was built in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style with buttressed walls and a square tower.[38] The pipe organ was added by Norman & Beard in 1914, and in 1922 Oscar Paterson contributed some of the stained glass windows such as 'The Sower'. In 2013 gravestones were vandalised in the graveyard.[9] Holburn Head Lighthouse, within the parish territory, was completed in 1862 to a design by David & Thomas Stevenson and has since achieved Category B listed status.[39]\\r\\nThe Swanson Gallery of Thurso hosts exhibitions throughout the year, and showcases glass art by Ian Pearson.[40] The Caithness Horizons building contains a museum and also hosts exhibitions. Hotels of note include the 103-room Royal Hotel,[41] Pentland Hotel, Waterside House, Murray House and the Category B listed Forss House Hotel, about 4 miles to the west of Thurso in a Georgian country mansion.[42] At Sir John's Square is an ornamental garden and statue which was donated to the town by Sir Tollemache Sinclair in memory of his grandfather Sir John Sinclair, a prominent local figure responsible for the \\"compilation of the First Statistical Account of Scotland and the pioneering of agricultural reforms in Caithness\\".[43] A Category C listed fountain was built in 1894 by the son of Sir George Sinclair. Also of note is the wellhouse of Meadow Well at the junction of Traill Street and Manson's Lane, which was the primary water supply for Thurso for centuries. The current well, with a conical roof, was completed in 1823.[44]\\r\\nThe main campus of North Highland College, formerly Thurso College, is one of several partner colleges which constitute the University of the Highlands & Islands. It offers several certificate, diploma and degree courses from subjects as diverse as Nuclear Decommissioning, Hairdressing, Gamekeeping and Golf Management. Adjacent to the UHI is Thurso High School, the most northerly secondary school on the British mainland, established in 1958. The town also has three primary schools, Pennyland, Miller Academy Primary[a] and Mount Pleasant.[46] Mount Pleasant Primary School teaches in Scottish gaelic, part of a revival of the language in Caithness.[20] According to the 2011 census, 110 residents of the town age three and over (1.43%) speak Gaelic while 181 overall (2.35%) have some facility with the language.[47] A Gaelic language nursery school, Crileagan Inbhir Thersa, was created in the town in 1996.[48]\\r\\nCaithness Horizons is a small museum that opened in 2008.[49] The museum now houses panels from the control room at the Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor (DMTR), which in 1958 had become Scotland's first operation nuclear reactor.[50]\\r\\nWith its powerful swells, Thurso is a notable location for surfing and kayaking, with international surfing championship events having regularly been held in the area.[51] It attracts surfers from all over the world,[52] and both the European Surfing Championships and Scottish Surf Kayaking Championships have been held in Caithness, with Thurso East being the main focus of activity. An annual raft race is organised by the North Coast Branch of Coastguard Association.[53]\\r\\nThe football (soccer) team, Thurso FC (nicknamed \\"the Vikings\\"), was established in 2008 and plays in the North Caledonian League. Caithness Crushers are a rugby league club playing in the Scotland Rugby League Conference Division 1, while Caithness RFC are a rugby union club that participate in the Caledonia One.[54] The local athletics club is Caithness Amateur Athletics Club (C.A.A.C.); hurdler Moira Mcbeath was a 1986 Commonwealth Games athlete.[55] Thurso has the largest swimming club in the Highland area, Thurso Amateur Swimming Club (TASC), with over 250 members.[56] Thurso Bowling Club is next door to the Tesco supermarket. Also of note is Caithness Motocross Club, which stages races fortnightly during the summer on tracks around the county.[57]\\r\\nThurso railway station opened in 1874. It was the most northern station on the Sutherland and Caithness Railway.[58] The station became part of the Highland Railway Company in the late 19th century[59] before being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923.[60] and it is now part of the Far North Line.[61]\\r\\nThe nearby port of Scrabster provides ferry services to the Orkney Islands. The A9 trunk road, which connects Thurso to Inverness, Perth and the Central Belt ends at the ferry terminal.[62] Stagecoach run bus services from Thurso to Wick and John O' Groats, and a long distance service to Helmsdale and Inverness.[63]\\r\\nThurso has been twinned with Brilon, Germany since 1972, after two men from the respective towns met in London and agreed a formal link. The twinning has come under threat as Thurso High School no longer participates in its activities and there is a lack of young people willing to preserve relationships between the towns.[64]\\r\\nNotes","input":"What is the northern most town in scotland?"},{"output":"being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth","context":"\\"This Woman's Work\\" is a song written and performed by the British singer Kate Bush. It was originally featured on the soundtrack of the American film She's Having a Baby (1988). The song was released as the second single from her album The Sensual World in 1989 and peaked at 25 in the UK Singles Chart.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lyric of \\"This Woman's Work\\" is about being forced to confront an unexpected and frightening crisis during the normal event of childbirth. Written for the movie She's Having a Baby,[2] director John Hughes used the song during the film's dramatic climax, when Jake (Kevin Bacon) learns that the lives of his wife, Kristy (Elizabeth McGovern), and their unborn child are in danger. As the song plays, we see a montage sequence of flashbacks showing the couple in happier times, intercut with shots of him waiting for news of Kristy and their baby's condition. Bush wrote the song specifically for the sequence, writing from a man's (Jake's) viewpoint and matching the words to the visuals which had already been filmed.[3]\\r\\nThe version of the song that was featured on The Sensual World was re-edited from the original version featured on the film soundtrack. The version released as a single was a third, slightly different mix.\\r\\n\\"This Woman's Work\\" is one of several songs that were completely re-recorded on her 2011 album Director's Cut. The new version features a sparse performance of Bush singing and playing piano.\\r\\nComposition\\r\\nAccording to the sheet music published in Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a slow tempo of 66 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A-flat major with Bush's vocal range spanning from A?3 to E?5.[4]\\r\\nThe music video for \\"This Woman's Work\\", which was directed by Bush herself, starts with Bush, spotlighted in an otherwise black room, playing the introductory notes on a piano. In the next scene, a distraught man (played by Tim McInnerny) is pacing in the waiting room of a hospital. It is then revealed through flashbacks that his wife (played by Bush) has collapsed while they were having dinner. The story blurs into a continuous scene where he carries her to the car, a desperate race to the hospital, and his wife being wheeled away on a stretcher as he races in behind her. While waiting, the husband is wracked with fear and imagines his wife in happier times, kissing him in the rain, and even imagines the nurse coming to tell him she has died. The nurse then pulls him out of his reverie, as she reassuringly puts her hand on his shoulder and tells him about his wife's situation, the outcome of this is left ambiguous. The final scene of the video returns to Bush as she silently closes the piano keyboard.\\r\\nA version of the B-side \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" had previously been featured in the film Castaway in 1986.

The military operations started with an attack on a US base by the Vietnam People's Army (NVA) and the Viet Cong on January 1, ending a truce declared by the Pope and agreed upon by all sides. At the end of January, the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong launched the Tet Offensive.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanoi erred monumentally in its certainty that the offensive would trigger a supportive uprising of the population. NVA and Viet Cong troops throughout the South, from Hue to the Mekong Delta, attacked in force for the first time in the war, but to devastating cost as ARVN and American troops killed close to 60,000 of the ill-supported enemy in less than a month. These reversals on the battlefield (the  Viet Cong would never again fight effectively as a cohesive force) failed to register on the American home front, however, as shocking photos and television imagery, and statements such as Conkrite's, fueled what would ultimately prove to be a propaganda victory for Hanoi.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeter Arnett quoting an unnamed US major as saying, \\"It became necessary to destroy the town to save it.\\" Eddie Adams' iconic image of South Vietnamese General Nguy?n Ng?c Loan's execution of a Vietcong operative was taken in 1968. The year also saw Walter Cronkite's call to honourably exit Vietnam because he thought the war was lost. This negative impression forced the US into the Paris peace talks with North Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nUS troop numbers peaked in 1968 with President Johnson approving an increased maximum number of US troops in Vietnam at 549,500. The year was the most expensive in the Vietnam war with the American spending US$77.4?billion (US$ 544?billion in 2018) on the war. The year also became the deadliest of the Vietnam War for America and its allies with 27,915 South Vietnamese (ARVN) soldiers killed and the Americans suffering 16,592 killed compared to around two hundred thousand of the communist forces killed. The deadliest week of the Vietnam War for the USA was during the Tet Offensive specifically February 11ÿ17, 1968, during which period 543 Americans were killed in action, and 2547 were wounded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) violated a New Year's truce.

The Commander of the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) General William Westmoreland described to Time the fighting \\"as the most intense of the entire war.\\"  MACV claimed that 5,000 communist forces had been killed.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long and bloody Battle of Khe Sanh began with an assault by the PAVN on a hill held by U.S. Marines.  Khe Sanh is in northwestern Qu?ng Tr? Province, near the Demilitarized Zone. The combatants were elements of the U.S. III Marine Amphibious Force (III MAF) and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) against two to three PAVN division-size elements.[16]  NVA General Vo Nguyen Giap later explained that his objective was to create a diversion to draw U.S. forces away from the populated areas of South Vietnam. Khe Sanh diverted 30,000 US troops away from the cities that would be the main targets of the Tet Offensive.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBattle of Ban Houei Sane began on the night of 23 January 1968, when the 24th Regiment of the PAVN 304th Division overran the small Laotian Army outpost at Ban Houei Sane.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOperation Coburg was an Australian military action that saw heavy fighting between the 1st Australian Task Force (1ATF) and PAVN and Viet Cong forces during the wider fighting around Long Binh and Bin Ha.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Time Magazine, General Westmoreland said, \\"the Communists seem to have run temporarily out of steam.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Westmoreland in his annual report said \\"In many areas the enemy has been driven away from the population centers; in others he has been compelled to disperse and evade contact thus nullifying much of his potential.

He also had 27 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[24] On December 23, Foles broke his hand against the Redskins, and was replaced by Vick in the season finale against the New York Giants.[25] On December 26, Foles was placed on injured reserve.[26]\\r\\nGoing into training camp, new head coach Chip Kelly announced that Foles would compete with Vick and newly drafted rookie Matt Barkley for the Eagles starting quarterback job in the 2013 season.[citation needed] Going into preseason, it became clear that the job was a two-way battle between Foles and Vick.[citation needed] Foles played average during preseason while Vick excelled past him. On August 20, it was announced that Vick would start the season and Foles would be the backup.\\r\\nFoles saw his first action during a Week 4 loss against the Denver Broncos. He completed 3 out of 4 attempted passes for a total of 49 yards and one touchdown, with no interceptions.[27]\\r\\nOn October 6, Foles entered the game against the New York Giants in the second quarter, after Vick suffered a hamstring injury. Foles completed 16 of 25 passes for 197 yards and 2 touchdowns, leading the Eagles to a 36ÿ21 win over the Giants.[28] Later in the week, it was announced that Foles would get the start in Week 6 against the 0ÿ4 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, after Vick was declared unable to start due to his injury. In his Week 6 start on October 13, Foles had one of the best starts of his career, completing 22 of 31 passes for 296 yards and 4 total touchdowns (3 passing, 1 rushing) in a 31ÿ20 win over the Bucs, a performance that earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[29]\\r\\nOn October 15, Vick announced that he needed another week of rehab before he was able to start again, making Foles the starter for the Week 7 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys for the division lead. However, against the Cowboys, Foles completed only 11 of 29 passes for a total of 80 yards, with no touchdowns.[30] In that same game, Foles left in the 4th quarter after suffering a head injury, and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley. Barkley did not perform well either, throwing 3 interceptions. The Eagles went on to lose 17ÿ3 to the Cowboys thus dropping to 3ÿ4 on the season and 1 game out of first place. The next day, Foles was diagnosed with a concussion and ruled out of any participation in the Week 8 matchup against the Giants on medical grounds.\\r\\nVick left the game late in the second quarter of the Eagles 15ÿ7 loss to the Giants in Week 8, aggravating the hamstring injury he had previously picked up in Week 5.\\r\\nFoles was given his third start of the season for Week 9 against the Oakland Raiders. Against the Raiders, Foles threw for seven touchdowns, tying a record held by six other quarterbacks. Foles is one of three quarterbacks to throw seven touchdowns and zero interceptions; he also amassed a perfect passer rating (158.3), having thrown more touchdown passes than incompletions.[31] Foles was awarded his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week Award of the season for his performance vs the Raiders.\\r\\nIn Week 10 of the regular season, Foles played in his sixth game of the season (four starts) against the Green Bay Packers. Coming into the game the Eagles had lost to the Packers on the last three occasions the teams had met (including post season).[32] Foles completed 12 out of 18 passes for a total of 228 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. His passer rating was extremely high for the second consecutive week, finishing at 149.3 and becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to post passer ratings above 149 in consecutive weeks. Foles carried 8 times during the game, including a 16 yard long run, finishing the game with 38 yards total and one fumble lost. The Eagles won the game 27ÿ13 and moved to 5ÿ5.[33]\\r\\nFoles continued as the starting quarterback in Week 11 of the regular season against the Washington Redskins at home. For the sixth time this season, Foles passer rating eclipsed 100, as he completed 17 of his 26 attempts for 298 yards with 0 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. Foles rushed the ball on 9 occasions during the game, ending with 47 total yards and a rushing touchdown. He led the Eagles to a 24ÿ0 lead at the end of the third quarter, before a comeback from the Redskins meant the game finished 24ÿ16.[34] The win moved the Eagles to an overall record of 6ÿ5ÿ0 and first position in the NFC East. The Eagles had not won at Lincoln Financial Field in 413 days since defeating the New York Giants on September 30, 2012; ending a streak of 10 consecutive home defeats.[35][36] On November 27, Foles was named the NFC Player of the Month for his play during the month of November.\\r\\nThe Eagles did not have a game scheduled for Week 12 of the regular season. The team returned to action on Sunday, December 1, for a home game against the Arizona Cardinals. Following their bye week, the Eagles had slipped into 2nd place in the divisional standings behind fierce rivals the Cowboys. Foles was named as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, a decision which Vick (who began the year as the number one quarterback) fully agreed with.[37]\\r\\nFor the seventh time this season, Foles's passer rating eclipsed 100, as he completed 21 of 34 attempted passes for a total of 237 yards, with 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. He also rushed for 22 yards on 9 attempts and fumbled on one occasion, although this was recovered by his teammates ÿ and did not result in a turnover. Following a closely contested game, the Eagles held on to win 24ÿ21 despite a fourth quarter comeback by Carson Palmer.[38] Foles set a team record for most passes without an interception (233), breaking Michael Vick's mark of 224 set in 2010. He also moved within one touchdown pass of the record 20 straight touchdown passes set by Peyton Manning and zero interceptions to start a season before throwing an interception in a blizzard game in Philadelphia against the Detroit Lions in which the Eagles won 34ÿ20. [39] The win took the Eagles to an overall record of 8ÿ5 and surpassed Dallas for the number one spot in the NFC East. A week later in Minnesota, the team's five game winning streak was snapped with a loss to Minnesota. However, Foles again had another impressive game with yet another passer rating over 100 and three more touchdowns and only his second interception of the season.[40] The following week, the Eagles defeated the Chicago Bears 54ÿ11, which saw another passer rating over 100 and a completion of 84.0% of his passes, a career-high.[41] Foles helped lead the Eagles to their first NFC East division title in three years by beating the Cowboys in the regular season finale. Foles had his ninth game with a passer rating over 100.[42]\\r\\nFoles finished the 2013 regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, surpassing Tom Brady's 2010 season posting of 36/4 for the best TD-INT ratio in NFL history, and a season leading 119.0 passer rating and third in NFL history trailing only to Aaron Rodgers' 122.5 rating in 2011 and Peyton Manning's 121.1 rating in 2004.[43] Foles led the Eagles to a playoff berth, the first since 2010. Hosting the Saints in the playoffs at Lincoln Financial Field, the Eagles lost on a last-minute field goal as the game ended at 26ÿ24. Foles threw for 195 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, for a passer rating of 105.0, in his postseason debut.[44] Foles was awarded the \\"NFL Greatness on the Road\\" award for his seven touchdown, perfect game performance against the Oakland Raiders during a road game in 2013.\\r\\nFoles was also assigned to the 2014 Pro Bowl as an alternate and was drafted by Team Sanders. Despite losing the game, Foles went 7 for 10 for 89 yards and a go ahead touchdown. Foles won the Pro Bowl Offensive MVP award, which included a new GMC truck.[45]\\r\\nGoing into 2014, Chip Kelly had released Foles' top receiver, DeSean Jackson, but Jeremy Maclin, who had good chemistry with Foles in 2012, returned from an ACL tear and had a career season, gaining 702 yards and six touchdowns with Foles as quarterback, finishing with 1,318 yards and ten scores. He was also aided by rookie receiver Jordan Matthews, second year tight end Zach Ertz, and veteran running back Darren Sproles.\\r\\nFoles and the Eagles kicked off their 2014 season with a Week 1 home matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Foles started the game poorly, losing 2 fumbles and throwing an interception in the first half. Foles only lost 2 fumbles and threw 2 interceptions the entire 2013 season. The Eagles defense also performed poorly, as they trailed 17ÿ0 after the first half. However, the Eagles roared back in the second half, scoring 34 unanswered points to defeat the Jags 34ÿ17. Overall, Foles completed 24 of 45 passes for 332 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with the 3 turnovers.[46]\\r\\nFoles led the Eagles to a 30ÿ27 win over the Colts after trailing by as much as 20ÿ6 early in the third. Foles went 21ÿ37, passing for 331 yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception during the game.[46]\\r\\nFoles played his best game of the young season in 37ÿ34 win over the division rival Washington Redskins.[47] Foles fought off the slow starts of games past, a strong Washington defensive front seven, and a brutal blindside hit from Washington defensive lineman Chris Baker which resulted in a major brawl between both teams and causing Eagles left tackle Jason Peters, the strongest player in their line, and Baker to be ejected from the game.[48][49] Foles finished the game completing 66 percent of his passes, going for 325 yards and three touchdowns. In Week 8, Foles set a franchise record for most completions in a game with 36 and threw a career-high 62 times in a close loss to the Arizona Cardinals, finishing with 411 passing yards and 2 TDs.[50] The following week in a game against the Houston Texans, Foles left the game during the first half with a broken collarbone, which led to Foles being put on injured reserve, ending his 2014 season. Mark Sanchez finished out the season as the Eagles starting quarterback.[51]\\r\\nAfter a league-best 27ÿ2 TD-INT ratio in 2013, Foles finished the season with 2,163 yards in 8 games, and a 13ÿ10 TD-INT ratio.[52] He also fumbled 4 times, only recovering it once. Overall, all of his stats were narrowly beaten by Sanchez, including turnovers (14ÿ11 TDÿINT ratio). On the bright side, he was on pace to have over 4,000 yards passing and he led the team to a 6ÿ2 record as starter, first place in the NFC East and second place in the NFC.\\r\\nOn March 10, 2015, the Eagles traded Foles, a 2015 fourth-round pick, and a 2016 second-round pick to the St. Louis Rams in exchange for Sam Bradford and a 2015 fifth-round pick.[53][54][55] Foles signed a two-year, $24.5 million extension with the Rams on August 7, 2015.[56] Foles's first game with the team came against the division rival Seattle Seahawks, who had the league's No. 1 defense in 2013 and 2014. Foles went 18 for 27 and passed for 297 yards in the game, and his lone passing touchdown came with 53 seconds left, bringing the game into overtime. He also ran for 11 yards and 1 touchdown, which put the Rams in the lead in the middle of the second quarter. In overtime, Foles threw a 22-yard pass to wide receiver Stedman Bailey, which set up the Rams' game-winning field goal over the defending NFC Champions.[57]\\r\\nFollowing the dramatic win, Foles struggled against his former divisional rival, the Washington Redskins. Although he didn't turn the ball over, he only completed 17 passes out of 32 for 150 yards and the Rams lone touchdown as they lost 24ÿ10.[58] Foles' accuracy improved the following week, going 19ÿ28 for 197 yards, but he threw no touchdowns and his first interception as a Ram against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Rams dropped to 1ÿ2.[59] Following the two losses, Foles bounced back, going 16ÿ24 for 3 touchdowns and no turnovers to hand the 3ÿ0 Arizona Cardinals their first loss of the season.[60] After that game, Foles' problems with turnovers from 2014 started to show, as he completed 11 passes out of 30 for 141 yards, 1 touchdown, and a career-high 4 interceptions against the Green Bay Packers.[61] On November 16 Foles was benched in favor of Case Keenum. He won his starting job back two weeks later after Keenum was out with a concussion, but his struggles worsened. In a loss against Cincinnati Bengals, he went 30ÿ46 for 228 yards (his second highest total of the year) and 3 interceptions, and followed it up by going 15/35 for 146 yards and 1 interception in a 27ÿ3 loss to the Arizona Cardinals.[62][63] Foles was again benched after Keenum returned from his concussion.\\r\\nUpset that the now-Los Angeles Rams drafted quarterback Jared Goff with the first overall pick of the 2016 NFL draft, Foles requested and was granted a release on July 27, 2016.[64]\\r\\nFoles signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 3, 2016. It was a one-year deal worth $1.75 million and included a second-year option for 2017, worth between $6.75 million and $16 million depending on his performance during the Chiefs' 2016 season.[65] In Week 8 at Indianapolis Colts after Alex Smith left the game with a concussion, Foles took over for the remainder of the game, and finished 16/22 completions with 223 yards and two touchdowns.[66] The Chiefs announced that Foles would start in Week 9 against the Jacksonville Jaguars as Smith was still recovering from injury.[67] Foles won the game over the Jaguars, 19ÿ14, and finished 20ÿ33 with 187 yards and a touchdown.[68] The next day, Smith was announced to start Week 10.[69]\\r\\nOn March 9, 2017, the Chiefs declined a second-year option on his contract, making him a free agent.[70]\\r\\nOn March 13, 2017, Foles signed a two-year contract to return to the Philadelphia Eagles to back up 2016 first-round pick Carson Wentz.[71][72] During Week 14 against the Los Angeles Rams, Foles came in relief of Wentz, who left the game with a torn ACL. Foles completed 6 of 10 passes for 42 yards as the Eagles won 43ÿ35, clinching their first division title since 2013. On December 11, 2017, head coach Doug Pederson announced that Foles would be the starter after Wentz was ruled out for the season.[73] Starting his first game of the season in Week 15, Foles threw for 237 yards and 4 touchdowns in a 34ÿ29 victory over the New York Giants.[74]\\r\\nOn January 13, 2018, the Eagles defeated the Atlanta Falcons 15ÿ10, in the NFC Divisional playoff game, with Foles completing 23 of 30 passes for 246 yards. This was the Eagles' first playoff victory in nine seasons.[75] On January 21, 2018, the Eagles defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 38ÿ7, in the NFC Championship Game, with Foles going 26 of 33 for 352 yards and 3 touchdowns. The Vikings were 3-point favorites with the league's top-ranked defense entering the game.[76][77][78][79]\\r\\nIn Super Bowl LII, Foles caught a touchdown pass from tight end Trey Burton, becoming the first player to both throw and catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, while also being the third quarterback to catch a pass in a Super Bowl, after John Elway in Super Bowl XXII and Jim Kelly in Super Bowl XXVI. The Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41ÿ33 to win their first Super Bowl. Foles completed 28 of 43 passes for 373 yards, 3 passing touchdowns and 1 interception, and was named the Most Valuable Player of the game.[80][81]\\r\\nFoles is a Christian, saying, \\"I'm a Christian and I believe in God... and when you do great, you stay humble and you give Him glory.\\"[84][85] Foles is currently an online graduate student at Liberty University, earning his master's degree in divinity.[86]\\r\\nFoles has planned to become a pastor after his football career, saying, \\"I want to be a pastor in a high school, It's on my heart. I took a leap of faith last year and signed up to take classes at seminary. I wanted to continue to learn and challenge my faith. It's a challenge because you are writing papers that are biblically correct. You want to impact people's hearts.\\"[87]\\r\\nHe married Tori Moore, who is the younger sister of former NFL tight end Evan Moore, in 2014.[88] Moore and Foles were briefly teammates with the Eagles in 2012.\\r\\nThe couple have a daughter, Lily James, born in 2017.[89]\\r\\nNames in bold are still active","input":"What teams did quarterback nick foles play for?"},{"output":"AD 79","context":"25,000 years before present to 1944\\r\\nMount Vesuvius ( /v??su?vi?s/; Italian: Monte Vesuvio [?monte ve?zu?vjo]; Neapolitan: Vesuvio; Latin: Mons Vesuvius [m??s w??s?w?.?s]; also Vesevus or Vesaevus in some Roman sources)[1] is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about 9?km (5.6?mi) east of Naples and a short distance from the shore. It is one of several volcanoes which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Vesuvius consists of a large cone partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius is best known for its eruption in AD 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, as well as several other settlements. The eruption ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second,[2] ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] More than 1,000 people died in the eruption, but exact numbers are unknown. The only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4]\\r\\nVesuvius has erupted many times since and is the only volcano on the European mainland to have erupted within the last hundred years. Today, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world because of the population of 3,000,000 people living nearby and its tendency towards violent, explosive eruptions of the Plinian type, making it the most densely populated volcanic region in the world.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVesuvius has a long historic and literary tradition. It was considered a divinity of the Genius type at the time of the eruption of AD 79: it appears under the inscribed name Vesuvius as a serpent in the decorative frescos of many lararia, or household shrines, surviving from Pompeii. An inscription from Capua[6] to IOVI VESVVIO indicates that he was worshipped as a power of Jupiter; that is, Jupiter Vesuvius.[7]\\r\\nThe historian Diodorus Siculus relates a tradition that Hercules, in the performance of his labors, passed through the country of nearby Cumae on his way to Sicily and found there a place called \\"the Phlegraean Plain\\" (phlegraion pedion, \\"plain of fire\\"), \\"from a hill which anciently vomited out fire ... now called Vesuvius.\\"[8] It was inhabited by bandits, \\"the sons of the Earth,\\" who were giants. With the assistance of the gods he pacified the region and went on. The facts behind the tradition, if any, remain unknown, as does whether Herculaneum was named after it. An epigram by the poet Martial in 88 AD suggests that both Venus, patroness of Pompeii, and Hercules were worshipped in the region devastated by the eruption of 79.[9] Mount Vesuvius was regarded by the Romans as being devoted to the hero and demigod Hercules.[10]\\r\\nVesuvius was a name of the volcano in frequent use by the authors of the late Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Its collateral forms were Vesaevus, Vesevus, Vesbius and Vesvius.[11] Writers in ancient Greek used Ѯ?? or Ѯ???. Many scholars since then have offered an etymology. As peoples of varying ethnicity and language occupied Campania in the Roman Iron Age, the etymology depends to a large degree on the presumption of what language was spoken there at the time. Naples was settled by Greeks, as the name Nea-polis, \\"New City\\", testifies. The Oscans, a native Italic people, lived in the countryside. The Latins also competed for the occupation of Campania. Etruscan settlements were in the vicinity. Other peoples of unknown provenance are said to have been there at some time by various ancient authors.\\r\\nSome theories about its origin are:\\r\\nVesuvius is a distinctive \\"humpbacked\\" peak, consisting of a large cone (Gran Cono) partially encircled by the steep rim of a summit caldera caused by the collapse of an earlier and originally much higher structure called Mount Somma.[15] The Gran Cono was produced during the A.D. 79 eruption. For this reason, the volcano is also called Somma-Vesuvius or Somma-Vesuvio.\\r\\nThe caldera started forming during an eruption around 17,000 (or 18,300) years ago[16][17][18] and was enlarged by later paroxysmal eruptions,[19] ending in the one of AD 79. This structure has given its name to the term \\"somma volcano\\", which describes any volcano with a summit caldera surrounding a newer cone.[20]\\r\\nThe height of the main cone has been constantly changed by eruptions but was 1,281?m (4,203?ft) in 2010.[17] Monte Somma is 1,132?m (3,714?ft) high, separated from the main cone by the valley of Atrio di Cavallo, which is 5?km (3.1?mi) long. The slopes of the volcano are scarred by lava flows, while the rest are heavily vegetated, with scrub and forests at higher altitudes and vineyards lower down. Vesuvius is still regarded as an active volcano, although its current activity produces little more than sulfur-rich steam from vents at the bottom and walls of the crater. Vesuvius is a stratovolcano at the convergent boundary where the African Plate is being subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Layers of lava, ash, scoria and pumice make up the volcanic peak. Their mineralogy is variable, but generally silica-undersaturated and rich in potassium, with phonolite produced in the more explosive eruptions.[21]\\r\\nVesuvius was formed as a result of the collision of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper into the earth. As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.\\r\\nThe volcano is one of several which form the Campanian volcanic arc. Others include Campi Flegrei, a large caldera a few kilometers to the north west, Mount Epomeo, 20 kilometres (12?mi) to the west on the island of Ischia, and several undersea volcanoes to the south. The arc forms the southern end of a larger chain of volcanoes produced by the subduction process described above, which extends northwest along the length of Italy as far as Monte Amiata in Southern Tuscany. Vesuvius is the only one to have erupted within recent history, although some of the others have erupted within the last few hundred years. Many are either extinct or have not erupted for tens of thousands of years.\\r\\nMount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500.[19] The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (especially in 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one.\\r\\nThe eruptions vary greatly in severity but are characterized by explosive outbursts of the kind dubbed Plinian after Pliny the Younger, a Roman writer who published a detailed description of the 79 AD eruption, including his uncle's death.[22] On occasion, eruptions from Vesuvius have been so large that the whole of southern Europe has been blanketed by ash; in 472 and 1631, Vesuvian ash fell on Constantinople (Istanbul), over 1,200 kilometres (750?mi) away. A few times since 1944, landslides in the crater have raised clouds of ash dust, raising false alarms of an eruption.\\r\\nScientific knowledge of the geologic history of Vesuvius comes from core samples taken from a 2,000?m (6,600?ft) plus bore hole on the flanks of the volcano, extending into Mesozoic rock. Cores were dated by potassiumÿargon and argonÿargon dating.[23] The volcano started forming 25,000 years ago. Although the area has been subject to volcanic activity for at least 400,000 years, the lowest layer of eruption material from the Somma caldera lies on top of the 40,000 year?old Campanian ignimbrite produced by the Campi Flegrei complex, and was the product of the Codola Plinian eruption 25,000 years ago.[15]\\r\\nIt was then built up by a series of lava flows, with some smaller explosive eruptions interspersed between them. However, the style of eruption changed around 19,000 years ago to a sequence of large explosive Plinian eruptions, of which the AD 79 one was the most recent. The eruptions are named after the tephra deposits produced by them, which in turn are named after the location where the deposits were first identified:[24]\\r\\nThe volcano was then quiet (for 295 years, if the 217 BC date for the last previous eruption is true) and was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards, except at the top, which was craggy. The volcano may have had only one summit at that time, judging by a wall painting, \\"Bacchus and Vesuvius\\", found in a Pompeian house, the House of the Centenary (Casa del Centenario).\\r\\nSeveral surviving works written over the 200?years preceding the AD 79 eruption describe the mountain as having had a volcanic nature, although Pliny the Elder did not depict the mountain in this way in his Naturalis Historia:[30]\\r\\nOn August 24, in the year AD 79, Vesuvius erupted in one of the most catastrophic and famous eruptions of all time. Historians have learned about the eruption from the eyewitness account of Pliny the Younger, a Roman administrator and poet.[34]\\r\\nThe volcano ejected a cloud of stones, ashes and volcanic gases to a height of 33?km (21?mi), spewing molten rock and pulverized pumice at the rate of 6G105 cubic metres (7.8G105?cu?yd) per second, ultimately releasing a hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings.[3] The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were destroyed by pyroclastic surges and the ruins buried under dozens of feet of tephra.[3][34]\\r\\nThe AD 79 eruption was preceded by a powerful earthquake seventeen years beforehand on February 05 of AD 62, which caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, and particularly to Pompeii.[35] Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted.[36] The deaths of 600 sheep from \\"tainted air\\" in the vicinity of Pompeii indicates that the earthquake of AD 62 may have been related to new activity by Vesuvius[37]\\r\\nThe Romans grew accustomed to minor earth tremors in the region; the writer Pliny the Younger even wrote that they \\"were not particularly alarming because they are frequent in Campania\\". Small earthquakes started taking place on 20 August 79[36] becoming more frequent over the next four days, but the warnings were not recognized.[a]\\r\\nReconstructions of the eruption and its effects vary considerably in the details but have the same overall features. The eruption lasted two days. The morning of the first day was perceived as normal by the only eyewitness to leave a surviving document, Pliny the Younger. In the middle of the day an explosion threw up a high-altitude column from which ash and pumice began to fall, blanketing the area. Rescues and escapes occurred during this time. At some time in the night or early the next day pyroclastic surges in the close vicinity of the volcano began. Lights were seen on the peak interpreted as fires. People as far away as Misenum fled for their lives. The flows were rapid-moving, dense and very hot, knocking down wholly or partly all structures in their path, incinerating or suffocating all population remaining there and altering the landscape, including the coastline. These were accompanied by additional light tremors and a mild tsunami in the Bay of Naples. By late afternoon of the second day, the eruption was over, leaving only haze in the atmosphere through which the sun shone weakly.\\r\\nThe latest scientific studies of the ash produced by Vesuvius reveals a multi-phase eruption.[38] The initial major explosion produced a column of ash and pumice ranging between 15 and 30 kilometres (49,000 and 98,000?ft) high, which rained on Pompeii to the southeast but not on Herculaneum upwind. The chief energy supporting the column came from the escape of steam superheated by the magma, created from seawater seeping over time into the deep faults of the region, that came into interaction with magma and heat.\\r\\nSubsequently, the cloud collapsed as the gases expanded and lost their capability to support their solid contents, releasing it as a pyroclastic surge, which first reached Herculaneum but not Pompeii. Additional blasts reinstituted the column. The eruption alternated between Plinian and Pelan six times. Surges 3 and 4 are believed by the authors to have buried Pompeii.[39] Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.\\r\\nAnother study used the magnetic characteristics of over 200 samples of roof-tile and plaster fragments collected around Pompeii to estimate equilibrium temperature of the pyroclastic flow.[40] The magnetic study revealed that on the first day of the eruption a fall of white pumice containing clastic fragments of up to 3 centimetres (1.2?in) fell for several hours.[41] It heated the roof tiles up to 140?C (284?F).[42] This period would have been the last opportunity to escape.\\r\\nThe collapse of the Plinian columns on the second day caused pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) that devastated Herculaneum and Pompeii. The depositional temperature of these pyroclastic surges ranged up to 300?C (572?F).[43] Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as 100?C (212?F).[44]\\r\\nThe only surviving eyewitness account of the event consists of two letters by Pliny the Younger to the historian Tacitus.[4] Pliny the Younger describes, amongst other things, the last days in the life of his uncle, Pliny the Elder. Observing the first volcanic activity from Misenum across the Bay of Naples from the volcano, approximately 35 kilometres (22?mi), the elder Pliny launched a rescue fleet and went himself to the rescue of a personal friend. His nephew declined to join the party. One of the nephew's letters relates what he could discover from witnesses of his uncle's experiences.[45][46] In a second letter the younger Pliny details his own observations after the departure of his uncle.[47][48]\\r\\nThe two men saw an extraordinarily dense cloud rising rapidly above the peak. This cloud and a request by a messenger for an evacuation by sea prompted the elder Pliny to order rescue operations in which he sailed away to participate. His nephew attempted to resume a normal life, but that night a tremor awoke him and his mother, prompting them to abandon the house for the courtyard. Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.\\r\\nThe early light was obscured by a black cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the population began to call to each other and move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.\\r\\nPliny's uncle Pliny the Elder was in command of the Roman fleet at Misenum, and had meanwhile decided to investigate the phenomenon at close hand in a light vessel. As the ship was preparing to leave the area, a messenger came from his friend Rectina (wife of Tascius[49]) living on the coast near the foot of the volcano explaining that her party could only get away by sea and asking for rescue. Pliny ordered the immediate launching of the fleet galleys to the evacuation of the coast. He continued in his light ship to the rescue of Rectina's party.\\r\\nHe set off across the bay but in the shallows on the other side encountered thick showers of hot cinders, lumps of pumice and pieces of rock. Advised by the helmsman to turn back, he stated \\"Fortune favors the brave\\" and ordered him to continue on to Stabiae (about 4.5 kilometers from Pompeii).\\r\\nPliny the Elder and his party saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected to take to the fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny sat down on a sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.[50]\\r\\nIn the first letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger suggested that his uncle's death was due to the reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16?km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so it is more likely that the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack.[51] His body was found with no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.\\r\\nAlong with Pliny the Elder, the only other noble casualties of the eruption to be known by name were Agrippa (a son of the Herodian Jewish princess Drusilla and the procurator Antonius Felix) and his wife.[52]\\r\\nBy 2003, around 1,044?casts made from impressions of bodies in the ash deposits had been recovered in and around Pompeii, with the scattered bones of another 100.[53] The remains of about 332 bodies have been found at Herculaneum (300 in arched vaults discovered in 1980).[54] What percentage these numbers are of the total dead or the percentage of the dead to the total number at risk remain completely unknown.\\r\\nThirty-eight percent of the 1,044 were found in the ash fall deposits, the majority inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits,[53] and thus were probably killed by them ÿ probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris thrown around. In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under 23 metres (75?ft) of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.\\r\\nPeople caught on the former seashore by the first surge died of thermal shock. No boats have been found, indicating they may have been used for the earlier escape of some of the population. The rest were concentrated in arched chambers at a density of as high as 3 persons per square meter. As only 85 metres (279?ft) of the coast have been excavated, the casualties waiting to be excavated may well be as high as the thousands.[55]\\r\\nSince the eruption of AD 79, Vesuvius has erupted around three dozen times. It erupted again in 203, during the lifetime of the historian Cassius Dio. In 472, it ejected such a volume of ash that ashfalls were reported as far away as Constantinople. The eruptions of 512 were so severe that those inhabiting the slopes of Vesuvius were granted exemption from taxes by Theodoric the Great, the Gothic king of Italy. Further eruptions were recorded in 787, 968, 991, 999, 1007 and 1036 with the first recorded lava flows. The volcano became quiescent at the end of the 13th century and in the following years it again became covered with gardens and vineyards as of old. Even the inside of the crater was moderately filled with shrubbery.\\r\\nVesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929 and 1944.\\r\\nThe eruption of April 05 in 1906,[56][57] killed more than 100 people and ejected the most lava ever recorded from a Vesuvian eruption. Italian authorities were preparing to hold the 1908 Summer Olympics when Mount Vesuvius violently erupted, devastating the city of Naples and surrounding comunes. Funds were diverted to the reconstruction of Naples, requiring a new location for the Olympics to be found.\\r\\nThe last major eruption was in March 1944. It destroyed the villages of San Sebastiano al Vesuvio, Massa di Somma, Ottaviano, and part of San Giorgio a Cremano.[58] From March 18 to 23, 1944, lava flows appeared within the rim. There were outflows. Small explosions then occurred until the major explosion took place on March 18, 1944.[59]\\r\\nAt the time of the eruption, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 340th Bombardment Group was based at Pompeii Airfield near Terzigno, Italy, just a few kilometres from the eastern base of the volcano. The tephra and hot ash damaged the fabric control surfaces, the engines, the Plexiglas windscreens and the gun turrets of the 340th's B-25 Mitchell medium bombers. Estimates ranged from 78 to 88 aircraft destroyed.[60]\\r\\nThe eruption could be seen from Naples. Different perspectives and the damage caused to the local villages were recorded by USAAF photographers and other personnel based nearer to the volcano.[61]\\r\\nLarge Vesuvian eruptions which emit volcanic material in quantities of about 1 cubic kilometre (0.24?cu?mi), the most recent of which overwhelmed Pompeii and Herculaneum, have happened after periods of inactivity of a few thousand years. Sub-Plinian eruptions producing about 0.1 cubic kilometres (0.024?cu?mi), such as those of 472 and 1631, have been more frequent with a few hundred years between them. Following the 1631 eruption until 1944 every few years saw a comparatively small eruption which emitted 0.001ÿ0.01?km3 of magma. It seems that for Vesuvius, the amount of magma expelled in an eruption increases very roughly linearly with the interval since the previous one, and at a rate of around 0.001 cubic kilometres (0.00024?cu?mi) for each year. This gives an approximate figure of 0.06 cubic kilometres (0.014?cu?mi) for an eruption after 60?years of inactivity.[62]\\r\\nMagma sitting in an underground chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The effect is to increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases to come out of solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.\\r\\nThe government emergency plan for an eruption therefore assumes that the worst case will be an eruption of similar size and type to the 1631 VEI 4[63] one. In this scenario the slopes of the volcano, extending out to about 7 kilometres (4.3?mi) from the vent, may be exposed to pyroclastic surges sweeping down them, whilst much of the surrounding area could suffer from tephra falls. Because of prevailing winds, towns and cities to the south and east of the volcano are most at risk from this, and it is assumed that tephra accumulation exceeding 100 kilograms per square metre (20?lb/sq?ft) ÿ at which point people are at risk from collapsing roofs ÿ may extend out as far as Avellino to the east or Salerno to the south-east. Towards Naples, to the north west, this tephra fall hazard is assumed to extend barely past the slopes of the volcano.[62] The specific areas actually affected by the ash cloud will depend upon the particular circumstances surrounding the eruption.\\r\\nThe plan assumes between two weeks and 20 days' notice of an eruption and foresees the emergency evacuation of 600,000?people, almost entirely comprising all those living in the zona rossa (\\"red zone\\"), i.e. at greatest risk from pyroclastic flows.[5][64] The evacuation, by trains, ferries, cars, and buses is planned to take about seven days, and the evacuees will mostly be sent to other parts of the country rather than to safe areas in the local Campania region, and may have to stay away for several months. However, the dilemma that would face those implementing the plan is when to start this massive evacuation, since if it is left too late then thousands could be killed, while if it is started too early then the precursors of the eruption may turn out to have been a false alarm. In 1984, 40,000?people were evacuated from the Campi Flegrei area, another volcanic complex near Naples, but no eruption occurred.[64]\\r\\nOngoing efforts are being made by the government at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings[64] and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away.[65] One of the underlying goals is to reduce the time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30?years, to two or three days.[66]\\r\\nThe volcano is closely monitored by the Osservatorio Vesuvio in Naples with extensive networks of seismic and gravimetric stations, a combination of a GPS-based geodetic array and satellite-based synthetic aperture radar to measure ground movement and by local surveys and chemical analyses of gases emitted from fumaroles. All of this is intended to track magma rising underneath the volcano. No magma has been detected within 10?km of the surface, and so the volcano is classified by the Observatory as at a Basic or Green Level.[67]\\r\\nThe area around Vesuvius was officially declared a national park on June 5, 1995.[68] The summit of Vesuvius is open to visitors and there is a small network of paths around the volcano that are maintained by the park authorities on weekends. There is access by road to within 200 metres (660?ft) of the summit (measured vertically), but thereafter access is on foot only. There is a spiral walkway around the volcano from the road to the crater.\\r\\nThe first funicular cable car on Mount Vesuvius opened in 1880. It was later destroyed by the March 1944 eruption. \\"Funicul, Funicul\\", a famous Neapolitan language song with lyrics by journalist Peppino Turco set to music by composer Luigi Denza, commemorates its opening.","input":"When did mount vesuvius erupt for the first time?"},{"output":"Robert Serber","context":"The Dayton Project was a research and development project to produce polonium during World War II, as part of the larger Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. Work took place at several sites in and around Dayton, Ohio. Those working on the project were ultimately responsible for creating the polonium-based modulated neutron initiators which were used to begin the chain reactions in the atomic bombs.\\r\\nThe Dayton Project began in 1943 when Monsanto's Charles Allen Thomas was recruited by the Manhattan Project to coordinate the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at various sites. Scientists at the Los Alamos Laboratory calculated that a plutonium bomb would require a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources used radioactive polonium and beryllium, so Thomas undertook to produce polonium at Monsanto's laboratories in Dayton. While most Manhattan Project activity took place at remote locations, the Dayton Project was located in a populated, urban area. It ran from 1943 to 1949, when the Mound Laboratories were completed in nearby Miamisburg, Ohio, and the work moved there.\\r\\nThe Dayton Project developed techniques for extracting polonium from the lead dioxide ore in which it occurs naturally, and from bismuth targets that had been bombarded by neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Ultimately, polonium-based neutron initiators were used in both the gun-type Little Boy and the implosion-type Fat Man used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The fact that polonium was used as an initiator was classified until the 1960s, but George Koval, a technician with the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment, penetrated the Dayton Project as a spy for the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, a chemist and director of research at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as the deputy chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for propellants, explosives and the like.[1] Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, a member of the NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University and the chairman of the NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the wartime Manhattan Project responsible for building an atomic bomb. When he got there, Thomas found Conant was also present.[2][3]\\r\\nGroves and Conant were hoping to harness Thomas's industrial expertise for the benefit of the project.[4] They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto.[5] Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at Los Alamos would be led by the youthful Joseph W. Kennedy.[4]\\r\\nAt Los Alamos, physicist Robert Serber proposed that instead of relying on spontaneous fission, the chain reaction inside the atomic bomb should be triggered by a neutron initiator. The best-known neutron sources were radium-beryllium and polonium-beryllium. The latter was chosen, as polonium has a 138-day half-life, which made it intense enough to be useful but not long-lived enough to be stockpiled. Thomas took charge of the development of techniques to industrially refine polonium for use with beryllium in the \\"urchin\\" internal neutron initiators. This effort became the Dayton Project.[6][7]\\r\\nThomas brought in key personnel from Monsanto's Thomas and Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, including Caroll Hochwalt, James Lum and Nicholas Samaras. Thomas became Director of the Dayton Project, with Hochwalt as Assistant Project Director and Lum as Laboratory Director.[8] They decided that about twelve chemists would be required, and Lum set about recruiting professors, graduate students and industrial chemists from universities and laboratories in the area. The first of these recruits commenced in August 1943, but few had any experience with radiochemistry.[9] Numbers increased from 46 full-time employees at the end of 1943 to 101 at the end of 1944, 201 at the end of 1945, and 334 at the end of 1946,[10] including 34 members of the Army's Special Engineer Detachment.[11]\\r\\nOffice space was initially found in the Monsanto offices at 1515 Nicholas Rd, which became known as Unit I.[12] Unit II was the Monsanto Rocket Propellant works off Betty Lane near Ohio State Route 741. While it was administered by Monsanto, it was not used by the Dayton Project. The site handled explosives including ammonium nitrate and ammonium picrate, but no radioactive materials were handled there. Work at Unit II ceased in the fall of 1945.[13] Consideration was given to using it in December 1946, but this proposal was rejected in favor of erecting a Quonset hut at Unit III.[14]\\r\\nA laboratory site was found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which used it as a warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. The building was in poor shape when the Dayton Project took it over, with many broken windows, and the staircase between the second and third floors was missing. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. Initially only the bottom two floors were occupied, providing 560 square meters (6,000?sq?ft) of laboratory space. Later, the third floor was taken over as well, providing another 280 square meters (3,000?sq?ft).[15][16][12] In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, a physics laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.[17]\\r\\nBy 1944, space was running short, and Monsanto began negotiations to acquire the Runnymede Playhouse in the wealthy residential Dayton suburb of Oakwood. Built in 1927, the Playhouse was a leisure facility that included an outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom, a squash court, a tennis court with a cork floor and a stage for community theater. It had showers with Italian marble and a ?1?1?2-story garage.[18][19] The estate was owned by the Talbott Realty Company, which was controlled by Thomas's wife's family. The Talbotts were among the heirs of the Delco company, which was by then a part of General Motors.[7][20] The Oakwood City Council wanted the Playhouse as a community center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them that it would not be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for.[19] When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944.[18] A lease was signed on 10 March 1944, under which the Talbott Realty was paid $4,266.72 per annum for the property. The lease was initially up to 30 June 1944, but was then extended annually until 30 June 1949. The lease specified that the property would be returned in its original condition. Talbott Realty were told that the property would be used to produce training films.[21]\\r\\nRemodeling began on 17 March 1944.[18] The tennis courts were subdivided into multiple rooms. The ceiling was lowered, and heating, air conditioning and air filtration systems were added. One of the greenhouses was converted into a loading dock. The property was enclosed in a barbed wire fence that was floodlit by night, and patrolled around the clock by armed guards; there were 43 guards at Units III and IV.[22] The Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along with a wire fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.[18]\\r\\nIn May 1945, Monsanto rented three floors of a warehouse at 601 East Third Street from General Electric. Initially it was used to receive and store equipment used by the Project. Later the fourth floor was used as office space, and a laboratory was established on the fifth floor where studies were carried out on the effects of polonium on laboratory animals. Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium contamination of the samples.[12][23]\\r\\nFew people had seen polonium before. It was a silvery metal. In a dark room, it gave off an eerie, purple glow.Mref name=\\"Building\\"/> Polonium occurs naturally in various ores, and the lead dioxide residues from the refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, left over after the removal of uranium and radium, were estimated to contain 0.2 to 0.3 milligrams (0.0031 to 0.0046?gr) of polonium per metric ton.[24][25] A curie of polonium weighs about 0.2 milligrams (0.0031?gr).[26] Port Hope was already under contract from the Manhattan Project for the supply and refining of uranium ore.[27] The first 3,290 kilograms (7,250?lb) of radioactive lead dioxide was delivered to the Dayton Project on 10 November 1943. The first 230-kilogram (500?lb) batch was processed by 8 December, which made 30 microcuries (1.1?MBq) of polonium available for experiments a week later.[28]\\r\\nThree processes were investigated for extracting the polonium from the ore. J. H. Dillon of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company had patented a process in which the lead oxide was dissolved in hydrochloric acid:[26]\\r\\nThe polonium could then be deposited on copper or nickel sheets. This required large-scale glass-lined equipment not available in Dayton, but available at the Monsanto B plant in Monsanto, Illinois. After small-scale tests at Unit III revealed that the process was practical, some three tons of lead dioxide were sent to the B plant, and 2.50 curies (93?GBq) were recovered. Getting the polonium off the copper and nickel sheets proved more problematic.[24]\\r\\nA second method attempted was a kiln process. The idea was to simply roast the lead dioxide and vaporize the polonium. The problem was that lead dioxide slagged at 700?C (1,292?F), which was too low for the process to work. So lead orthophosphate was tried, which slagged at 900?C (1,650?F). This was made by mixing the lead dioxide with phosphoric acid. Experiments showed that the polonium vaporized well when the lead orthophosphate was heated to 750?C (1,380?F) for four hours. Unfortunately, the process then ran into problems with dust and other foreign matter, and with contamination of the personnel and equipment involved.[29][30]\\r\\nThe third method involved dissolving the lead dioxide in a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide:[30]\\r\\nThis proved to be the best way to separate the polonium from the lead dioxide, although there were problems with the precipitation of various contaminants, including iron and aluminum. Although about 32 metric tons (35 short tons) of lead dioxide were treated with nitric acid, and about 40 curies (1.5?TBq) of polonium were produced, the process did not proceed beyond the pilot stage because a better source of polonium became available.[31] The lead dioxide was not purchased by the Manhattan Project, and early in the war had been acquired by the Canadian government. In June 1945, the lead was precipitated as a lead carbonate slurry, and shipped to the Manhattan District's Madison Square area to be dried and returned to Canada.[32]\\r\\nPolonium could also be produced by neutron irradiation of bismuth. In 1943 the only polonium produced in this manner was in cyclotrons, but the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear reactors offered the prospect of producing large amounts of polonium in this manner:[31]\\r\\nA metric ton of bismuth irradiated in the Manhattan Project's X-10 Graphite Reactor at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, contained 32 to 83 curies (1.2 to 3.1?TBq) of polonium, a vast improvement over the yields from Port Hope's lead dioxide.[31] Irradiated bismuth came from Clinton in the form of 30.5-by-9.5-by-9.5-centimeter (12 by 3.75 by 3.75?in) bricks that weighed about 26 kilograms (58?lb). They were shipped to Dayton by rail in wooden boxes, which were stored in a tile-lined cavity in the floor at Unit IV.[33]\\r\\nThese procedures were adequate because the quantity of polonium in the bismuth was still fairly low, but starting in June 1945, the Dayton Project began receiving bismuth irradiated in the more powerful reactors at the Hanford Site in Washington, which now became the major source of supply.[34] Even at Clinton, unprotected bismuth proved problematic when a brick broke apart and chips fell into containers of uranium slugs, and had to be hazardously separated by hand by project personnel. Bismuth slugs irradiated in the reactors at Hanford were therefore canned in aluminium. The canned slugs were 3.8 centimeters (1.5?in) in diameter, and 10 or 20 centimeters (4 or 8?in) long. The problem was that the aluminium contained impurities such as iron, manganese, copper, lead, tin, zinc, silicon, titanium, nickel, magnesium, chromium, vanadium, bismuth and gallium, and when irradiated, these could form radioactive isotopes. Most were of little concern for the Dayton Project, as they had short half-lives, and would become harmless during the slugs' cooling off period in water at Hanford; but iron could form iron-59, which had a half-life of 45 days, and produced gamma radiation. The slugs were therefore shipped in casks, each of which contained several tubes which held the slugs. The spaces between the tubs was filled with lead. At Dayton, the slugs were stored in a lead-lined safe with doors on both sides containing tubes. They were also stored underwater on racks, and could be removed with tongs. A periscope allowed the identification markings on the slugs to be checked without removing them from the pool.[33]\\r\\nBy the end of 1946 Hanford was shipping material that contained up to 13,200 curies (490?TBq) per metric ton of bismuth.[34] Bismuth was purchased from the American Smelting and Refining Company of the highest purity that it could produce. It was sent to Hanford, where it was canned, and placed inside a reactor for 100 days. The irradiated slugs were then shipped by road to Unit IV, where they were bathed in hydrochloric acid, which dissolved the aluminum. This formed an aluminum chloride solution that was disposed of, as it was highly radioactive due to the iron impurities in the aluminum. The bismuth slugs were then dissolved in aqua regia. This was too weak for electroplating the polonium, so the nitric acid was removed, and then the polonium deposited on bismuth by adding powdered bismuth. This resulted in a 100ÿ1 concentration. This could then be repeated by dissolving in aqua regia again to achieve a 1000ÿ1 concentration. This was again dissolved, and the polonium electroplated on platinum foils. The main problem with the process was that it required glass-lined containers due to the aqua regia, and mechanisms for safe handling of the radioactive material. The Dayton Project explored alternative purification methods that were found to be workable, but less efficient or safe.[35]\\r\\nThe first consignment of polonium left for Los Alamos on 15 March 1944 in a lead-lined suitcase carried by a military courier. Regular shipments were made thereafter.[19][36] Initiator testing at Los Alamos required more polonium than anticipated, and in December 1944, Oppenheimer was forced to ask Thomas if he could ship 20 curies (0.74?TBq) per month. The Dayton Project was able to do so. In February 1945, Thomas agreed to increase shipments to 100 curies (3.7?TBq) per month by June, and 500 per month by December.[37]\\r\\nThe total cost of the Dayton Project up to the end of 1946 was $3,666,507 ($46?million in today's dollars).\\r\\nDayton Project employees were not allowed to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. The chemists wore protective gear, with surgical, cloth and rubber gloves worn in three layers. When leaving for lunch or at the end of the shift, they had to wash their hands with dilute hydrochloric acid, dilute Clorox, and soap. The radioactive residue on their hands was measured with a special Geiger counter designed for the purpose by physicist John J. Sopka.[19][39] No more than one thousand counts per minute per hand was permissible.[40] They had to shower at the end of each day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.[19]\\r\\nGeorge Koval was drafted into the United States Army in 1943, and was inducted into the Manhattan Project's Special Engineer Detachment. He was initially assigned to the Clinton Engineer Works, where his job as a health physics officer gave him access to much of the site. He began passing secrets relating to the production of polonium at Oak Ridge to the Soviet Union through his s GRU (Soviet military intelligence) handler code-named \\"Clyde\\". In 1945 Koval was transferred to Dayton. Again, his job as a health physics officer gave him wide access to the secret installation.[41] In 2007 Russian President Vladimir Putin posthumously awarded Koval a gold star, making him a hero of the Russian Federation for his work as the GRU spy \\"Delmar\\". Russian officials stated that the initiator for their Joe-1 bomb had been \\"prepared to the recipe provided by Delmar\\".[41] The fact that polonium was used as an initiator remained classified until the 1960s.[42]\\r\\nAfter Leonard I. Schiff calculated that an initiator could theoretically improve the efficiency of a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators to be included in the Little Boy design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.[43]\\r\\nThe initiator used in the implosion design of the Fat Man bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki was code-named \\"urchin\\". In order to increase the efficiency of the explosion, the initiator had to emit a large number of neutrons in a few microseconds while the plutonium core was fully compressed.[44] At the heart of the urchin was a solid beryllium sphere 0.4 centimeters (0.16?in) in diameter. This was gold-plated and coated with 20 curies (0.74?TBq) of polonium. The gold kept the polonium's alpha particles from striking the beryllium. This fitted inside two beryllium hemispheres with 15 parallel grooves cut into the inner surface. These grooves converted the shock wave of the implosion into jets that shattered the spheres and caused the beryllium and polonium to mix and emit neutrons. The hemispheres were nickel-plated and the outer surface was coated in gold and 30 curies (1.1?TBq) of polonium. The 2.0-centimeter (0.79?in) initiator, which was hot to the touch, fitted neatly inside the 20-millimeter (0.8?in) hole in the center of the plutonium pit. [45][46]\\r\\nBy 1945, the Dayton Project has assumed such importance that the Manhattan Project decided to make it into a permanent facility.[47] The original intention was to move operations to Oak Ridge, but it was decided that a site near Dayton was preferable. Few of the scientific and technical staff wanted to move to Tennessee, and there were concerns about the dangers of polonium contamination at a plutonium processing site.[48] A search for a suitable site began in early 1946, and one was found in Miamisburg, about 19 kilometers (12?mi) from Dayton. The 72-hectare (178-acre) site was adjacent to a state park containing a large prehistoric Indian burial mound, which ultimately gave the Mound Laboratories their name. It was initially known as Unit V.[47] Monsanto commenced construction in May 1946, using the firm of Giffels and Vallet of Detroit as architects, while the plant was built by the Maxon Construction of Dayton.[47] The design called for an underground complex that could withstand a direct hit from a 910-kilogram (2,000?lb) bomb, with protection against biological and chemical weapons, at a cost of $17,900,000.[49]\\r\\nResponsibility for nuclear weapons production was transferred from the Manhattan Project to the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947, but work continued on the Mound Laboratories.[47] The first building was completed in May 1948, and polonium processing commenced at the Mound Laboratories in February 1949. Altogether, 14 major buildings were constructed with a total floor space of 34,000 square meters (366,000?sq?ft) at a cost of $25.5 million.[50] Due to fear of attack or sabotage, the former Scioto Laboratory Complex in Marion, Ohio, was acquired by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948. It was maintained as a cold standby site until it was no longer needed in 1953.[51]\\r\\nUnit I continued to be used by Monsanto as an administrative facility until the 1988, when it was demolished. The land was sold to Quality Chemicals in 1992, and then to DuPont in 2002.[52][53] Unit III, the former Bonebrake Theological Seminary, was decontaminated in 1950 and returned to the Dayton Board of Education. The original seminary building was subsequently demolished, but several structures remain from the Dayton Project.[54] The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 10 May 2006.[55] Although the lease on Unit IV, the former Runnymede Playhouse, specified that it was to be returned, it was deemed to be too contaminated. The building was demolished in February 1950.[50] Even the cobblestones in the driveway were ripped up and taken away, along with 2.1 meters (7?ft) of earth from under the house. The excavation was filled in, and the site was returned to the Talbott family, who were paid $138,750 in compensation. As of 2017[update], all that remains of the original playhouse is a brass doorknob and part of the greenhouse roof, which are part of the collection of the Mound Science and Energy Museum. Private residences now occupy the site.[19][56] The Dayton Warehouse was decontaminated in 1950 and returned to its owners.[57] The Mound Laboratories continued to produce polonium initiators until 1969. Polonium continued to be produced there for commercial sales and use in satellites until 1972. The laboratories were decommissioned in 1993, and the area was decontaminated. As of 2017[update], it houses the Mound Advanced Technology Center.[56]\\r\\nIn 1996, the Department of Energy, which had succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided that since the Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant inclusion in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This was carried out in 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.[58]","input":"Who invented the trigger for the atomic bomb?"},{"output":"14 May 1984","context":"The Australian one-dollar coin is the second-most-valuable circulation denomination coin of the Australian dollar after the two-dollar coin; there are also non-circulating legal-tender coins of higher denominations (five-, ten-, two-hundred-dollar coins[1] and the one-million-dollar coin[2]).\\r\\nIt was first issued on 14 May 1984[3] to replace the one-dollar note which was then in circulation, although plans to introduce a dollar coin had existed since the 1970s.[3] The first year of minting saw 186.3 million of the coins produced at the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra.[3]\\r\\nThree portraits of Queen Elizabeth II have featured on the obverse, the 1984 head of Queen Elizabeth II by Arnold Machin; between 1985 and 1998 the head by Raphael Maklouf; and since 1999 the head by Ian Rank-Broadley.

The Rams defeated the Titans by the score of 23ÿ16, capturing their first Super Bowl win and first NFL championship since 1951.[5] The game, played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, was the fourth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (the previous time this happened was Super Bowl XXVIII, and coincidentally that game was also played on January 30 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta).[6]\\r\\nThe Rams entered their second Super Bowl in team history with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record. It was the franchise's first playoff appearance since 1989, when they were still in Los Angeles. The Titans, who were originally the Houston Oilers, also finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record, but advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history after entering the playoffs as a wild-card team. Tennessee finished in second place in the AFC Central division behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars.[7]\\r\\nThe first two quarters of Super Bowl XXXIV were largely a defensive battle. Despite outgaining the Titans in total offensive yards in the first half, 294ÿ89,[8] the Rams held only a 9ÿ0 halftime lead on three field goals. St. Louis later scored their first touchdown midway through the 3rd quarter to go up 16ÿ0. Tennessee then responded by scoring 16 consecutive points to tie the game with 2:12 left in regulation. This was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first deficit that was greater than 10 points. On the Rams' ensuing drive, quarterback Kurt Warner completed a 73-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Isaac Bruce to regain the lead. The Titans then drove to the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds remaining, but on the final play of the game, Rams linebacker Mike Jones tackled Tennessee wide receiver Kevin Dyson one yard short of the goal line to prevent a potential game-tying touchdown. This play went into NFL lore as One Yard Short, or simply The Tackle.[9] Warner was then named Super Bowl MVP, becoming the sixth player to win both that award and the NFL MVP during the same season.[10][11] At the time, his 414 passing yards and 45 pass attempts without an interception broke Super Bowl records.[12][13][14]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"Dot-com Super Bowl\\" due to the large amount of advertisements purchased by dot-com companies.[15][16] This game was later featured as one of NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNFL owners awarded Super Bowl XXXIV to Atlanta during their October 31, 1996 meeting held in New Orleans. Other cities under consideration were Miami, Tampa, and Los Angeles. Owners initially planned on selecting only two hosts (XXXIII and XXXIV), but decided to name three after strong showings by the respective delegations. Miami, Atlanta, and Tampa were selected to host XXXIII, XXXIV, and XXXV, respectively.[17][18]\\r\\nThe Rams entered 1999 having been among the league's stragglers for a decade. The reasons are many, including, some suggest, mismanagement by executive John Shaw. The franchise moved to a taxpayer-funded stadium in St. Louis, Missouri for the 1995 season but continued to struggle. In 1997, the team hired Dick Vermeil as their head coach, bringing him back to the NFL after 15 years of retirement. Vermeil had previously turned the Philadelphia Eagles from one of the worst teams in the league into a Super Bowl team in 1980, but his first two seasons in St. Louis were hardly stellar, winning just 5 games in 1997 and 4 in 1998.\\r\\nLittle was expected of the Rams for 1999. Indeed, ESPN The Magazine's 1999 NFL preview predicted the Rams would be the worst team in the NFL; worse even than the Cleveland Browns, who had returned as an expansion team that year.\\r\\nThe Rams proceeded to shock the NFL with an NFC-best 13ÿ3 regular season record and outscored their opponents 526ÿ242, the highest scoring margin (284) of any Super Bowl champion. This was the Rams' first playoff appearance since 1989 and only the second Super Bowl appearance in team history.[19] St. Louis was led by undrafted quarterback Kurt Warner, who started the season as a backup to Trent Green. Green suffered a season-ending knee injury in the preseason, making Warner the team's new starter. Warner previously played for the Iowa Barnstormers of the Arena Football League and the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe.[20]\\r\\nIn his first NFL season in 1998, Warner played only one game and threw just 11 passes. But in 1999, he experienced one of the most spectacular seasons ever by a quarterback, recording a passer rating of 109.2, completing 65.1 percent of his passes for 4,353 yards, 41 touchdowns, and just 13 interceptions, and earning the NFL Most Valuable Player Award. Warner was not the only Rams player compiling significant statistics, though. Running back Marshall Faulk, in his first year in St. Louis after spending five seasons with the Indianapolis Colts, won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award. He scored 12 touchdowns, rushed for 1,381 yards, and recorded a team-leading 87 receptions for 1,048 yards. In all, Faulk gained a record 2,429 total yards and became just the second running back in NFL history to gain over 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season (Roger Craig was the first to do it, in 1985).[21] Faulk held the NFL record for yards from scrimmage in a single season until Tennessee's Chris Johnson broke it in 2009.\\r\\nFaulk wasnt the only weapon at Warner's disposal in 1999. Veteran receiver Isaac Bruce was the top Rams receiver with 77 receptions for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns. while breakout rookie wide receiver Torry Holt recorded 52 receptions, 788 yards, and 6 touchdowns. Even the team's third wide receiver, Az-Zahir Hakim, was a big contributor by catching 36 passes for 677 yards and 8 touchdowns, while also returning punts for 461 yards and another touchdown. The Rams' offensive line was led by Pro Bowlers Orlando Pace and Adam Timmerman. Timmerman, acquired by the Rams in 1999, had previously won Super Bowl XXXI with the Green Bay Packers. On special teams, receiver Tony Horne returned 30 kickoffs for 892 yards and 2 touchdowns, giving him an NFL-leading 29.7 yards per return average.[22]\\r\\nOverall, St. Louis' offense led the league in total yards gained (6,639), scoring (526 points), and passing touchdowns (42).\\r\\nThe Rams' defense led the league in fewest rushing yards allowed (1,189) and fewest rushing touchdowns allowed (4), while giving up just 242 points. Overall, the defense ranked 4th in the league in fewest total yards allowed (5,056).[21] The line was anchored by Pro Bowl defensive end Kevin Carter and defensive end Grant Wistrom. Carter led the league with 17 sacks, while Wistrom recorded 8.5 sacks and 2 interceptions, returning both for touchdowns and a combined total of 131 yards. Behind them, the Rams had three linebackers: London Fletcher (66 tackles and 3 sacks), Mike Jones (4 interceptions for 96 return yards and 2 touchdowns, and 2 fumble recoveries for 51 return yards and 1 touchdown), and Todd Collins (72 tackles, 1 sack, and 2 interceptions for 16 yards). The secondary was led by Pro Bowler Todd Lyght (6 interceptions), Dexter McCleon (4 interceptions), and rookie Dr Bly (3 interceptions).[23]\\r\\nThe Titans advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history, after originating as a charter member of the American Football League.[24] From 1960 to 1996, the team was owned by Houston, Texas businessman Bud Adams and known as the Houston Oilers. By 1995, however, Adams, like Frontiere, was lured to move his team from Houston, in this case to a new stadium in Nashville, Tennessee. Since this new stadium was not ready until the 1999 season, Adams decided to move his team to Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis, Tennessee in 1997 after playing before small Houston crowds in 1996.\\r\\nThe renamed Tennessee Oilers also played before sparse Memphis crowds, and thus spent the 1998 season playing at Nashville's Vanderbilt Stadium. After the new Adelphia Coliseum (now known as Nissan Stadium) was completed in 1999, the team's name was changed to Tennessee Titans.[25] [26] With Tennessee's Super Bowl appearance, every former AFL team had now played in the Super Bowl, including the original eight AFL teams and two AFL expansion teams: the Miami Dolphins and the Cincinnati Bengals.\\r\\nThe 1999 Titans were led by quarterback Steve McNair and running back Eddie George. McNair had missed five games due to injuries during the season, but he was still able to put up solid numbers, throwing for 2,179 yards and 12 touchdowns with only 8 interceptions. Despite his injury problems, McNair finished the season as the second-leading rusher on the team with 337 yards and scoring 8 touchdowns. George also had an outstanding season, rushing for 1,304 yards, and catching 47 passes for 458 yards (his receptions, receiving yards, and receiving touchdowns were all career highs). In all, George scored a grand total of 13 rushing and receiving touchdowns, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the 3rd consecutive year.[27]\\r\\nAnother contributor on the Titans' offense was fullback Lorenzo Neal, who frequently served as George's lead blocker and was widely considered one of the best blocking backs in the league. The team did not have any outstanding deep threats, but wide receiver Yancey Thigpen recorded 38 receptions for 648 yards, wide receiver Kevin Dyson had 54 receptions for 658 yards, and tight end Frank Wycheck caught 69 passes for 641 yards. Up front, their line was anchored by Pro Bowl tackle Bruce Matthews.[28]\\r\\nTennessee's defense was also extremely effective. Pro Bowl defensive end Jevon Kearse anchored the line, recording 14.5 sacks to go along with 8 forced fumbles and was named the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year. The linebacking corps was led by Eddie Robinson, who recorded 64 tackles and 6 sacks. Their secondary was led by cornerback Samari Rolle, who led the team with 4 interceptions.[29]\\r\\nThe Titans finished the regular season with a 13ÿ3 record (including a home win over the Rams), but finished second behind the 14ÿ2 Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Central. The Jaguars' only two losses were to the Titans, but Tennessee's three losses forced them to enter the playoffs as a wild-card team.[30]\\r\\nPlaying in his first ever NFL playoff game, Warner threw for 395 yards and 5 touchdowns, with 1 interception, as the Rams defeated the Minnesota Vikings, 49ÿ37, by scoring 35 unanswered points in the second half. Bruce caught 4 passes for 133 yards and a touchdown. Faulk gained 101 combined rushing/receiving yards and scored 2 touchdowns. Although Vikings quarterback Jeff George threw for 423 yards and 4 touchdowns, three of his scores occurred late in the 4th quarter, after the Rams had already put the game away.[31]\\r\\nThe Rams then narrowly defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 11ÿ6 in a hard-fought defensive struggle in the NFC Championship Game. The first half ended with the Rams leading 5ÿ3 on a Jeff Wilkins field goal and after a bad snap by the Buccaneers went through their own end zone for a safety. Tampa Bay then scored a field goal in the 3rd quarter to take the lead. But Warner threw a 30-yard go-ahead touchdown pass to receiver Ricky Proehl with 4:44 left in the game.[32]\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Titans started out their postseason by narrowly defeating the Buffalo Bills, 22ÿ16 on a famous, trick kickoff return play that became known in NFL lore as the Music City Miracle. Tennessee jumped to a 12ÿ0 halftime lead with an Al Del Greco field goal, a safety by Kearse, and a McNair touchdown run. However, Buffalo came back to take the lead, 13ÿ12 with Antowain Smith's two touchdown runs in the second half (the two-point conversion after Smith's second touchdown failed). In the 4th quarter, the Titans regained the lead after Del Greco kicked his second field goal. With 16 seconds left in the game, Bills kicker Steve Christie made what seemed to be the game-winning 41-yard field goal to give his team the lead, 16ÿ15. However, Neal received the ensuing kickoff and handed the ball off to Wycheck, who then lateraled the ball to Dyson on the other side of the field, who eventually ran 75 yards to the end zone for the game-winning touchdown.[33] The play was reviewed to determine whether Wycheck had lateraled the ball to Dyson or made an illegal forward pass. Referee Phil Luckett upheld the original call on the field of a touchdown, giving Tennessee the win.\\r\\nThe Titans then defeated the Indianapolis Colts 19ÿ16. After both teams exchanged field goals in the first half, George scored on a 68-yard touchdown run to give his team a 13ÿ9 lead. Del Greco then kicked two more field goals in the 4th quarter to put the game away. George finished the game with a franchise playoff record 162 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Del Greco made four field goals.[34]\\r\\nThe Titans then eliminated the Jacksonville Jaguars, 33ÿ14, in the AFC Championship Game. The Jaguars finished the 1999 regular season with a league-best 14ÿ2 record, and advanced to the AFC title game after crushing the Miami Dolphins 62ÿ7 and limiting future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino to just 11 of 25 completions for 95 yards and 1 touchdown, with 2 interceptions. However, Tennessee's defense dominated the Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game, forcing 6 turnovers.[35] Jacksonville led 14ÿ10 at halftime, but the Titans then scored 23 unanswered points on two touchdown runs by McNair, a safety, and Derrick Mason's 80-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. Although McNair passed for only 112 yards and one touchdown with one interception, he rushed for 91 yards and 2 touchdowns on 9 carries. George rushed for 86 yards and caught 3 passes for 19 yards.[36]\\r\\nIn January 2000, two ice storms struck the Atlanta area within a week of each other. The second storm occurred during the week the Super Bowl was hosted. Despite the rare adverse weather conditions, city and state crews kept streets and sidewalks free of ice, and MARTA public transport kept running. The Atlanta region does not receive more ice storms than most other areas of the country, and Super Bowl XXXIV was played indoors and unaffected by the elements. But some residents believe the poor weather during Super Bowl week negatively impacted the city's chances of hosting another Super Bowl, including the bid it lost for the Super Bowl XLIII.[37] That bid included meteorological data showing the rarity of such storms in the area.[38]\\r\\nNashville, home of the Titans, is also the midway point of the Atlanta-St. Louis highway corridor, which contains the entirety of Interstate 24, and uses other highways to complete the route.\\r\\nThis is, to date, the most recent Super Bowl in which neither team had won a Super Bowl before.\\r\\nABC televised the game in the United States with play-by-play announcer Al Michaels and color commentator Boomer Esiason. Chris Berman from Disney-owned corporate sibling ESPN hosted all the events. Berman was joined by fellow ESPN analyst Steve Young, while ESPN's Mike Tirico was on hand for the post-game presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Lesley Visser and Lynn Swann served as sideline reporters.\\r\\nIt was also the first Super Bowl to be aired in high definition and 5.1 Dolby Digital. ABC Sports chose to use the 720p format.[39]\\r\\nIronically, the ABC affiliate in St. Louis, KDNL-TV, has been regarded as one of the network's weakest affiliates since joining the network in 1995[citation needed]. The previous ABC affiliate, KTVI, in contrast, was one of the strongest affiliates[citation needed] ÿ it had become a Fox station in 1995, and thus, has televised the majority of the Rams' games in this period.\\r\\nThe game was later featured as one of the NFL's Greatest Games as The Longest Yard.\\r\\nThe pregame show featured a tribute to \\"The Great American Music of the 20th Century\\". Narrated by the Smothers Brothers, the show highlighted some of the unique American musical styles such as gospel, big band, classical, country and rock. Singers Tina Turner and Travis Tritt along with the Georgia Tech Marching Band and the Georgia Mass Choir performed during the show.\\r\\nCountry singer Faith Hill then sang the national anthem.\\r\\nTo celebrate the 30th anniversary of Super Bowl IV, the following participants of the game were featured during the coin toss ceremony: Bud Grant, Lamar Hunt, Bobby Bell, Paul Krause, Willie Lanier, Alan Page, and Jan Stenerud.[40]\\r\\nThe E-Trade halftime show was produced by Disney and titled \\"Tapestry of Nations\\" after the Epcot parade of the same name. The show, narrated by actor Edward James Olmos, was inspired by Walt Disney World's millennium celebration. It featured a full symphony orchestra conducted by Steven Byess; a multi-generational, 80-person choir; and singers Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Tina Turner, and Toni Braxton.[41]\\r\\nSetlist:[42]\\r\\nThis game is often referred to as the \\"dot-com\\" Super Bowl since it was held during the height of the dot-com bubble, and several Internet companies purchased television commercials. E-Trade ran a commercial featuring a chimpanzee dancing in an E-Trade T-shirt and the text \\"Well, we just wasted 2 million bucks.\\" Lifeminders.com ran a commercial of plain typewritten text beginning with the line \\"This is the worst commercial on the Super Bowl. But it might be the best thing you see tonight.\\" Pets.com famously paid millions for an advertisement featuring a sock puppet, though the company would collapse before the end of the year.[43]\\r\\nThe two teams defenses seemed to dominate most of the first half. The Rams started the game out strong by taking the opening kickoff and marching to the Tennessee 17-yard line. But on third down, safety Blaine Bishop pressured quarterback Kurt Warner to throw an incomplete pass. Then the ensuing field goal attempt failed when punter/holder Mike Horan fumbled the snap. The Titans responded by moving the ball to the St. Louis 29-yard line, aided with running back Eddie George's 32-yard reception. However, they also came up empty after kicker Al Del Greco missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.\\r\\nFor the rest of the half, the Titans were forced to punt on all of their possessions. In contrast, the Rams were able to reach inside the Tennessee 20-yard line on all four of their remaining drives before halftime, but on each one, the Titans' defense forced St. Louis to settle for field goal attempts from kicker Jeff Wilkins, who was successful in making three of them, but missed one attempt from 34 yards. The Rams ended up leading at halftime, 9ÿ0, but their scoring margin over the Titans seemed somewhat small, considering they drove into scoring range on every one of their first-half possessions and outgained Tennessee in total yards, 294ÿ89.\\r\\nBoth teams' offenses started to get going in the second half. The Titans took the opening kickoff of the 3rd quarter and drove 43 yards to the St. Louis 29-yard line. But Tennessee remained scoreless after defensive back Todd Lyght blocked Del Greco's 47-yard field goal attempt. After that, Warner converted a third down situation with a completion to Marshall Faulk, then on the next two plays threw a 31-yard strike to wide receiver Isaac Bruce and a 16-yard completion to tight end Ernie Conwell before finishing the 68-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt, giving St. Louis a 16ÿ0 lead. On the completion to Conwell, Bishop combined to make the tackle, but suffered a spinal injury and had to leave the game. The game was delayed for several minutes while Bishop was being treated.\\r\\nTennessee wide receiver Derrick Mason returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 34-yard line. From there, five runs by George good for 24 yards, three completions from quarterback Steve McNair to tight end Frank Wycheck for 15 yards and a run by McNair for two advanced the ball to the St. Louis 25-yard line. Then McNair scrambled 23 yards to the 2-yard line, setting up a 1-yard touchdown run by George two plays later. The touchdown cut the Titans' deficit to 16ÿ6 after McNair's pass to Wycheck on the two-point conversion attempt fell incomplete.[44]\\r\\nThe Titans' first score sparked them to rally. After forcing the Rams to punt on their ensuing possession, a pair of 21-yard completions from McNair to tight end Jackie Harris and wide receiver Isaac Byrd aided a 13-play, 79-yard drive that was capped by George's 2-yard touchdown run to make the score 16ÿ13. The Tennessee defense then forced the Rams to a three-and-out, and Horan's 30-yard punt gave the Titans the ball back at their 47-yard line. The Titans' offense then drove only 28 yards on their ensuing possession, but it was close enough for Del Greco to attempt a 43-yard field goal. This time, Del Greco's kick was good, tying the score at 16ÿ16 with just 2:12 left in the game. The 16-point deficit was the largest deficit to be erased in a Super Bowl and the first greater than 10 points. It was also the first time in any Super Bowl a team down double digits in the 4th quarter had tied the game. Also, however, the Titans only tied the game and hadn't yet gained the lead.\\r\\nThen on the Rams' first play of their ensuing drive, Warner threw a long pass that was caught at the Titans' 38-yard line by Bruce, who then ran it all the way into the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown to give St. Louis a 23ÿ16 lead. Likewise, in the 1951 NFL Championship Game, quarterback Norm Van Brocklin's 73-yard game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Tom Fears broke a 17ÿ17 tie in the fourth quarter and gave the Rams a seven-point victory to win the NFL title.[45] Warner's touchdown pass to Bruce was his only completion of the 4th quarter.\\r\\nThe Titans took over the ball at their own 12-yard line with 1:48 left in the game after committing a holding penalty on the ensuing kickoff. McNair started out the drive with a pair of completions to Mason and Wycheck for gains of 9 and 7 yards to reach the 28-yard line. After an incomplete pass, defensive back Dr Bly's 15-yard facemask penalty while tackling McNair on a 12-yard scramble gave the Titans a 1st down at the St. Louis 45-yard line. On the next play, St. Louis was penalized 5 yards for being offsides, moving the ball to the 40-yard line with 59 seconds left. McNair then ran for 2 yards, then threw a 7-yard completion to wide receiver Kevin Dyson. On the next play, Tennessee nearly lost the ball when Bly stepped in front of a pass intended for Mason, only to have it go right through his arms. Two plays later, with the Titans facing 3rd down and 5 to go, McNair was hit by two Rams defenders, but he escaped and completed a 16-yard pass to Dyson to gain a 1st down at the Rams 10-yard line. Tennessee then used up their final timeout with just six seconds left in the game, giving them a chance for one last play. This final play has gone down in NFL history as simply \\"The Tackle\\".[46][47]\\r\\nThe Titans had just used their final timeout with six seconds remaining. With the ball on the Rams' 10-yard line, the Titans were trailing by a touchdown and had one last opportunity to tie the game. The plan was to use tight end Frank Wycheck as a decoy. Wycheck would run straight up the field on the right side, to lure linebacker Mike Jones away from receiver Kevin Dyson. Dyson would then slant left through the middle of the field. With Jones occupying Wycheck, quarterback Steve McNair would pass the ball to Dyson, who would be open from about five yards out for the score.\\r\\nAs the play began, everything appeared to go as planned. Jones ran with Wycheck up the field at the beginning of the play. However, as the pass was being delivered to Dyson, Jones, who was at the goal line, glanced over his left shoulder and noticed an open Dyson catching the ball. Jones switched directions and ran towards the Titans receiver. Dyson ran directly toward the end zone, but his legs were wrapped up by Jones with about two and a half yards left to the goal line.\\r\\nSince Dyson was being tackled by the legs, there was still the possibility he could reach towards the end zone and get the ball across the goal line. Both players went into a rolling motion as Dyson outstretched his hand with the football towards the goal line in the hopes of scoring the touchdown. Though his reach was close, and the ball mere inches away from the end zone, it was still not enough to score. As the rolling motion came to an end, with Jones now on top of Dyson's legs, his shoulder had touched the ground and, therefore, the game was over. Had Dyson scored and the extra point been converted, it would have been the first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime. Alternatively, had Dyson scored, the Titans could have attempted a 2-point conversion for the outright win.\\r\\nConsidering the magnitude of the Super Bowl, and the wild game that preceded it, \\"The Tackle\\" is considered one of the greatest and most exciting game-ending plays in modern NFL history. The image of Dyson stretching the ball towards the goal line with Jones wrapped around him has become a staple of NFL highlights. ESPN.com ranked \\"The Tackle\\" as the 35th greatest moment of the past 25 years in sports (as of 2007).[48] NFL.com ranked Jones' tackle of Dyson as the fourth greatest clutch moment in Super Bowl history.[49] Fox Sports ranked The Tackle as the Greatest Clutch Play in Super Bowl History (as of 2007). Like Dallas Cowboys cornerback Larry Brown, Jones was included on the NFL Network's \\"Top 10 One-Hit Wonders\\" list (Jones was #10, Brown was #3), although Jones also mirrored Brown in having a solid if unspectacular career outside of his Super Bowl heroics.\\r\\nAfter the game, many sports writers commented on Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't impressed by it. \\"How can you be in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?\\" Warner pointed out. \\"People think this season is the first time I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years ÿ just not on this level, because I never got the chance. Sure, I had my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, and when you do achieve something, you know luck has nothing to do with it.\\"\\r\\nHowever, he later told The New York Times \\"I guess it is sort of a storybook ending. When you think about where I was and where I am now, it seems pretty incredible.\\"[50]\\r\\nat Georgia Dome, Atlanta\\r\\nBruce caught 6 passes for 162 yards (3rd highest) and a touchdown, an average of 27 yards per catch.

Alfred Prufrock\\", commonly known as \\"Prufrock\\", is the first professionally published poem by American-British poet T. S. Eliot (1888ÿ1965). Eliot began writing \\"Prufrock\\" in February 1910, and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse[2] at the instigation of Ezra Pound (1885ÿ1972). It was later printed as part of a twelve-poem pamphlet (or chapbook) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917.[1] At the time of its publication, Prufrock was considered outlandish,[3] but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th-century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism.\\r\\nThe poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri[4] and makes several references to the Bible and other literary worksincluding William Shakespeare's plays Henry IV Part II, Twelfth Night, and Hamlet, the poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet John Donne, and the nineteenth-century French Symbolists. Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers. The poem, described as a \\"drama of literary anguish\\", is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said \\"to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual\\" and \\"represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment\\".[5]\\r\\nPrufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia, the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress, and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love. With visceral feelings of weariness, regret, embarrassment, longing, emasculation, sexual frustration, a sense of decay, and an awareness of mortality, \\"Prufrock\\" has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEliot wrote \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" between February 1910 and July or August 1911. Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College, Oxford, Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound, who instantly deemed Eliot \\"worth watching\\" and aided the start of Eliot's career. Pound served as the overseas editor of Poetry: A Magazine of Verse and recommended to the magazine's founder, Harriet Monroe, that Poetry publish \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers. Pound claimed that Eliot \\"has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN. The rest of the promising young have done one or the other, but never both.\\"[7] The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue.[2][8]\\r\\nIn November 1915 \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\"along with Eliot's poems \\"Portrait of a Lady,\\" \\"The Boston Evening Transcript,\\" \\"Hysteria,\\" and \\"Miss Helen Slingsby\\"was included in Catholic Anthology 1914ÿ1915 edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London.[9]:297 In June 1917 The Egoist, a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden, published a pamphlet entitled Prufrock and Other Observations (London), containing twelve poems by Eliot. \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" was the first in the volume.[1] Also Eliot was appointed assistant editor of the Egoist in June 1917.[9]:290\\r\\nAccording to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon, when Eliot was writing the first drafts of Prufrock in his notebook in 1910ÿ1911, he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem.[10] According to the notebooks, now in the collection of the New York Public Library, Eliot finished the poem that was originally published sometime in July and August 1911when he was 22 years old.[11] In 1912, Eliot revised the poem and included a 38-line section now called \\"Prufrock's Pervigilium\\" which was inserted on those blank pages, and intended as a middle section for the poem.[10] However, Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken.[12] This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot's poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot's early, unpublished drafts in Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909ÿ1917.[11] This Pervigilium section describes the \\"vigil\\" of Prufrock through an evening and night[11]:41, 43ÿ44, 176ÿ90 described by one reviewer as an \\"erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld\\" that portray \\"in clammy detail Prufrock's tramping 'through certain half-deserted streets' and the context of his 'muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels.'\\"[13]\\r\\nIts reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917. \\"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to poetry.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot's reading of Prufrock and other poems in 1947, as part of their ongoing series of poetry readings by their authors.[15]\\r\\nIn his early drafts, Eliot gave the poem the subtitle \\"Prufrock among the Women.\\"[11]:41 This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication. Eliot called the poem a \\"love song\\" in reference to Rudyard Kipling's poem \\"The Love Song of Har Dyal,\\" first published in Kipling's collection Plain Tales from the Hills (1888).[16] In 1959, Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry:\\r\\n\\"Traces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them, but which I am myself prepared to disclose. I once wrote a poem called \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\": I am convinced that it would never have been called \\"Love Song\\" but for a title of Kipling's that stuck obstinately in my head: \\" The Love Song of Har Dyal.\\"[16]\\r\\nHowever, the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as \\"T.?Stearns Eliot,\\" very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock.[17] It is suggested that the name \\"Prufrock\\" came from Eliot's youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420ÿ422 North Fourth Street.[18][19][20] In a 1950 letter, Eliot said, \\"I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, but I think that it must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe draft version of the poem's epigraph comes from Dante's Purgatorio (XXVI, 147ÿ148):[11]:39, 41\\r\\nHe finally decided not to use this, but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem The Waste Land. The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also. Inferno (XXVII, 61ÿ66) reads:\\r\\nIn context, the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro, who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII, who wished to use Guido's advice for a nefarious undertaking. This encounter follows Dante's meeting with Ulysses, who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent. According to Ron Banerjee, the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock's intent. Like Guido, Prufrock had never intended his story to be told, and so by quoting Guido, Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock's love song.[24]\\r\\nFrederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from multiple personalities of sorts, and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the Inferno analogy. One is the storyteller; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world. He posits, alternatively, that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock, but that the role of Dante is filled by you, the reader, as in \\"Let us go then, you and I,\\" (1). In that, the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock's love song.[25]\\r\\nBecause the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, it can be difficult to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, \\"[the poem] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical\\".[26] This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not.[26][27] The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he wants to say, and to what the various images refer.\\r\\nThe intended audience is not evident. Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person[28] or directly to the reader,[29] while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes \\"The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature\\",[26] while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the \\"you and I\\" refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author.[30] Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before \\"the taking of a toast and tea\\", and \\"time to turn back and descend the stair.\\" This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to ask this \\"overwhelming question\\".[26] Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.[29][30]\\r\\nPerhaps the most significant dispute lies over the \\"overwhelming question\\" that Prufrock is trying to ask. Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her,[26] pointing to the various images of women's arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that the mermaids will not sing to him. Others, however, believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society, but fears rejection, pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society, such as \\"I have measured out my life with coffee spoons\\" (line 51). Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock's dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world.[31] McCoy and Harlan wrote \\"For many readers in the 1920s, Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual. He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment.\\"[29]\\r\\nIn general, Eliot uses imagery which is indicative of Prufrock's character,[26] representing ageing and decay. For example, \\"When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table\\" (lines 2ÿ3), the \\"sawdust restaurants\\" and \\"cheap hotels,\\" the yellow fog, and the afternoon \\"Asleep...tired... or it malingers\\" (line 77), are reminiscent of languor and decay, while Prufrock's various concerns about his hair and teeth, as well as the mermaids \\"Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black,\\" show his concern over aging.\\r\\nLike many of Eliot's poems, \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" makes numerous allusions to other works, which are often symbolic themselves.","input":"What is the poem the love song by j alfred prufrock about?"},{"output":"beefsteak","context":"A cheesesteak, also known as a Philadelphia cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak, cheesesteak sandwich,  cheese steak, or steak and cheese, is a sandwich made from thinly sliced pieces of beefsteak and melted cheese in a long hoagie roll.[1][2] A popular regional fast food, it has its roots in Philadelphia,[3] Pennsylvania, United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cheesesteak was developed in the early 20th century \\"by combining frizzled beef, onions, and cheese in a small loaf of bread\\", according to a 1987 exhibition catalog published by the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhiladelphians Pat and Harry Olivieri are often credited with inventing the sandwich by serving chopped steak on an Italian roll in the early 1930s.[5][6][7]  The exact story behind its creation is debated, but in some accounts, Pat and Harry Olivieri originally owned a hot dog stand, and on one occasion, decided to make a new sandwich using chopped beef and grilled onions.  While Pat was eating the sandwich, a cab driver stopped by and was interested in it, so he requested one for himself.  After eating it, the cab driver suggested that Olivieri quit making hot dogs and instead focus on the new sandwich.[6][8]  They began selling this variation of steak sandwiches at their hot dog stand near South Philadelphia's Italian Market. They became so popular that Pat opened up his own restaurant which still operates today as Pat's King of Steaks.[9]  The sandwich was originally prepared without cheese; Olivieri said provolone cheese was first added by Joe \\"Cocky Joe\\" Lorenza, a manager at the Ridge Avenue location.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCheesesteaks have become popular at restaurants and food carts throughout the city with many locations being independently owned, family-run businesses.[11][12] Variations of cheesesteaks are now common in several fast food chains.[13] Versions of the sandwich can also be found at high-end restaurants.[14] Many establishments outside of Philadelphia refer to the sandwich as a \\"Philly cheesesteak.\\"[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe meat traditionally used is thinly sliced rib-eye or top round, although other cuts of beef are also used.[15] On a lightly oiled griddle at medium temperature, the steak slices are quickly browned and then scrambled into smaller pieces with a flat spatula. Slices of cheese are then placed over the meat, letting it melt, and then the roll is placed on top of the cheese. The mixture is then scooped up with a spatula and pressed into the roll, which is then cut in half.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommon additions include sauted onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, ketchup, hot sauce, salt, and pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Philadelphia, most cheesesteak places use Amoroso rolls; these rolls are long, soft, and slightly salted.[17] One source writes that \\"a proper cheesesteak consists of provolone or Cheez Whiz slathered on an Amoroso roll and stuffed with thinly shaved grilled meat,\\"[18] while a reader's letter to an Indianapolis magazine, lamenting the unavailability of good cheesesteaks, wrote that \\"the mention of the Amoroso roll brought tears to my eyes.\\"[19] After commenting on the debates over types of cheese and \\"chopped steak or sliced,\\" Risk and Insurance magazine declared \\"The only thing nearly everybody can agree on is that it all has to be piled onto a fresh, locally baked Amoroso roll.\\"[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican cheese, Cheez Whiz, and provolone are the most commonly used cheeses or cheese products put on to the Philly cheesesteak.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite American cheese, along with provolone cheese, are the favorites due to their mild flavor and medium consistency. Some establishments melt the American cheese to achieve the creamy consistency, while others place slices over the meat, letting them melt slightly under the heat. Philadelphia Inquirer restaurant critic Craig LaBan says \\"Provolone is for aficionados, extra-sharp for the most discriminating among them.\\" Geno's owner, Joey Vento, said, \\"We always recommend the provolone. That's the real cheese.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nCheez Whiz, first marketed in 1952, was not yet available for the original 1930 version, but has spread in popularity.[22] A 1986 New York Times article called Cheez Whiz \\"the sine qua non of cheesesteak connoisseurs.\\"[23] In a 1985 interview, Pat Olivieri's nephew Frank Olivieri said that he uses \\"the processed cheese spread familiar to millions of parents who prize speed and ease in fixing the children's lunch for the same reason, because it is fast.\\"[24] Cheez Whiz is \\"overwhelmingly the favorite\\" at Pat's, outselling runner-up American by a ratio of eight or ten to one, while Geno's claims to go through eight to ten cases of Cheez Whiz a day.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, while running for President of the United States, John Kerry made what was considered a major faux pas when campaigning in Philadelphia and went to Pat's King of Steaks and ordered a cheesesteak with Swiss.[25]","input":"What kind of meat is philly cheese steak made out of?"},{"output":"Turner Entertainment Co.","context":"","input":"Who is the owner of tom and jerry?"},{"output":"a minimum of eight years  but most often at least 10 years  of university education and postgraduate training","context":"In the United Kingdom, a Chartered Engineer is an Engineer registered with the Engineering Council (the British regulatory body for engineers). Contemporary Chartered Engineers are degree-qualified and have gained professional competencies through training and monitored professional practice experience. This is a peer reviewed process. The formation process of a Chartered Engineer consists of obtaining an accredited Master of Engineering (MEng) degree, or BEng plus MSc or other masters degree or City and Guilds Post Graduate Diploma in an engineering discipline, and a minimum of four years of professional post graduate peer reviewed experience. The title Chartered Engineer is protected by civil law and is a terminal qualification in engineering. The Engineering Council regulates professional engineering titles in the UK. With more than 180,000 registrants from many countries, designation as a Chartered Engineer is one of the most recognisable international engineering qualifications.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Engineering Council, Chartered Engineers \\"are characterised by their ability to develop appropriate solutions to engineering problems, using new or existing technologies, through innovation, creativity and change. They might develop and apply new technologies, promote advanced designs and design methods, introduce new and more efficient production techniques, marketing and construction concepts, pioneer new engineering services and management methods. Chartered Engineers are variously engaged in technical and commercial leadership and possess interpersonal skills.\\"[1]\\r\\nCEng Requirements\\r\\nThe CEng qualification is a protected title, with an international brand recognition and a benchmark. To receive designation as a CEng, it is required in addition to engineering education on MEng level or equivalent UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC) training and experience to also demonstrate significant technical (design competencies) and commercial leadership and management competencies.[2]\\r\\nFor registration as a CEng, candidates must demonstrate that they are professionally competent through education, training and professional practice. Although many current Chartered Engineers have Higher National Certificates and Diplomas, honours degrees in engineering, science or mathematics, since 1997 it has been necessary to demonstrate further learning most commonly by completion of a four or five-year (in England and Wales) or five or six-year (in Scotland) integrated MEng degree, or by gaining an appropriate master's degree following completion of a three or four-year (in England and Wales) or four or five-year (in Scotland) honours baccalaureate degree in engineering or a cognate subject. The details of these engineering degrees are available on the Engineering Council website.\\r\\nCandidates are also required to demonstrate an appropriate level of professional competence to practise. This is accomplished through evidence gained from years of professional development, and by a professional peer review, personal interview and technical presentation in front of a professional board. The candidate's competence is further assessed during the final stage of assessment (professional peer review interview), conducted by two Chartered Engineers and a chairperson. A full description of the requirements for registration appears at the Engineering Council's website.[3] Overall, it takes a minimum of eight years  but most often at least 10 years  of university education and postgraduate training to achieve the Chartered Engineer qualification. Chartered Engineers are recognised in Europe as regulated professions, by the Directive 2005/36.[4]\\r\\nChartered Engineers are entitled to use the suffix, CEng, after names as a means of emphasising their status with the Engineering Council. They can also make use of a logo, which is intended primarily for use in correspondence and on business cards. This is restricted to use by Engineering Council registrants only, through approval by the patent office for its registration as a certification mark. This is written after honours, decorations and academic/university, but before letters denoting membership of professional engineering institutions. When a Chartered Engineer has more than one institution membership conferring designatory letters, the institution through which the holder is registered as a Chartered Engineer appears immediately after CEng, with other memberships following in order of the institution's foundation dates.\\r\\nThe level of competence required for registration as a Chartered Engineer in the U.K. is comparable to many continental European countries that require masters-level education for registration as a professional Engineer. The Washington Accord, signed by the Engineering Council in 1989, recognises \\"substantial equivalence\\" between the academic requirements for registration between signatories, meaning that foreign qualifications recognised by their local signatory body are accepted for Chartered Engineers, and UK qualifications can be used in applying for similar international statuses. Recognition under the Washington Accord is outcome-based, not based on the length of courses.[5][6]\\r\\nChartered Engineers are entitled to register through the European Federation of National Engineering Associations as a European Engineer and use the pre-nominal of EurIng.\\r\\nThe body that maintains the UK's register of Chartered Engineers is the Engineering Council.

It focuses on brothers Sam and Dean Winchester as they track down their father, John, who is on the trail of the demon who killed their mother and Sam's girlfriend. During their travels, they use their father's journal to help them carry on the family businesssaving people and hunting supernatural creatures. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles star as Sam and Dean, with Jeffrey Dean Morgan recurring as their father, John, and Nicki Aycox as the demonic Meg Masters. This is the only season to air on The WB Television Network, with all subsequent seasons airing on The CW Television Network, a joint venture of The WB and UPN.[1]\\r\\nThe first sixteen episodes of the season aired on Tuesdays at 9:00?pm ET in the United States, after which the series was rescheduled to Thursdays.[2] Overall, the season averaged about 3.81 million American viewers.[3] The season gained many award nominations, among them two Primetime Emmy Awards for work done on the pilot episode.[4] While some critics did not like the mostly anthology-like format,[5][6] others praised the show for the emotional moments[7] and noted the brotherly chemistry between the lead actors.[8]\\r\\nThe season was internationally syndicated, airing in the United Kingdom on ITV,[9] in Canada on Citytv,[10] and in Australia on Network Ten.[11] The first season was released on DVD as a six-disc box set on September 5, 2006, by Warner Home Video in Region?1.[12] Although the season was split into two separate releases in Region?2, the complete set was released on October 2, 2006,[13] and in Region?4 on October 2, 2007.[14] The episodes are also available through digital retailers such as Apple's iTunes Store,[15] Microsoft's Xbox Live Marketplace,[16] and Amazon.com's on-demand TV service.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this table, the number in the first column refers to the episode's number within the entire series, whereas the number in the second column indicates the episode's number within this particular season. \\"U.S. viewers in millions\\" refers to how many Americans watched the episode live or on the day of broadcast.\\r\\nThe first season's mythology mainly follows Sam and Dean's search for their missing father. Series creator Eric Kripke summarized this storyline as merely \\"find Dad\\", which he deemed \\"simple\\", \\"emotional\\", and \\"clean\\".[40] However, he found the self-enclosed episodesindependent stories which attain closure at the end of each episode and add little to the overarching storylinesto be \\"hit and miss\\".[40] Because the first ten episodes consist of self-enclosed stories, the series mythology does not begin until the eleventh episode, \\"Scarecrow\\". This episode introduces the demon Meg Masters, which executive producer Kim Manners felt was \\"desperately needed\\".[41] Though uncertain at exactly what direction to take the character, the writers intended Meg to be an antagonist for the Winchesters throughout her story arc.[42] The series mythology further expands with the addition of the demon-killing Colt handgun near the season's end, lending to the \\"modern American Western\\" theme the producers were going for.[43]\\r\\nAlthough the weekly adversaries for the Winchesters were often based on urban legends, the writers tried to put their own spin on the stories for each of the episodes. For example, Kripke combined the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization in the pilot.[45] The episode \\"Hook Man\\", however, borrowed three or four elements from the numerous variations of the Hook Man legend. The figure is an escaped mental patient in the traditional myth, but the writers decided for the purposes of the show to make him the ghost of a hook-handed killer. They also added a poltergeist element by having him attached to the conflicting emotions of the guest starshe wears a cross made from his melted hook.[46] Rather than focus on modern interpretations, Kripke and co-executive producer John Shiban decided that Supernatural's vampires would stem more from the original legends. The vampires were given retractable fangsthese were inspired by the rowed teeth of sharksas well as no aversion to sunlight or the crucifix. Kripke personally added the fact that vampires would become weak if given the blood of a dead man.[44]\\r\\nOther aspects grew out of basic concepts or ideas. For the episode \\"Skin\\", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change into one of the lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder at the end of the episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was \\"a great layer to add\\", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in \\"The Benders\\", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons.[47] Another element that would influence future episodes came about in \\"Hook Man\\" when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the \\"perfect combination of occult element\\", as it brought together a \\"folkloric repellent of evil\\" with the \\"blue-collar aspect of shotguns\\".[48] The episode \\"Asylum\\" later established iron as another weapon against ghosts.[49] \\"Faith\\", on the other hand, stemmed from the question of whether it truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, \\"[Layla's] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it.\\"[50] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create \\"scary\\" sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability.[50] Because the writers found the traditional look of the Reaperhooded and carrying a sickleto be cheesy, they ultimately made him appear as \\"the most shriveled old man you could ever imagine\\".[51]\\r\\nAlthough the villain of the episode \\"Hell House\\" has supernatural origins, the basis of the story came from a situation writer Trey Callaway had as a child; he and his friends created a fake murder scene in an abandoned barn and then convinced their friends that killings occurred there. The children would often go there to scare each other, with one girl running away and breaking her leg after believing that she saw an attacking ghost.[53] The human antagonists of \\"The Benders\\", however, were completely devoid of supernatural elements. Shiban made this decision not only to surprise the audience, but also to have the Winchesters face something they had never encountered before.[54] For \\"Nightmare\\", Tucker tried to write the character Max as sympathetic, and thus had difficulties in deciding how to end the episode. The writers eventually decided to have him kill himself to prevent him from doing more harm.[55]\\r\\nStarting off on the series, Kripke excluded vampires due to their affiliation to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He wanted Supernatural to have its own identity, but became more comfortable with it over time. The writers intended for the vampire-episode \\"Dead Man's Blood\\" to be a self-enclosed episode, but Kripke's introduction of the Colt tied it to the final two episodes of the season.[56] This addition pleased the writers of the penultimate episode \\"Salvation\\" because the Colt gave the brothers a way to fight Meg and also provided a reason for her to kill the Winchesters' friends.[57] Gamble and Tucker crafted the latter storyline because they felt Kripke would only allow their inclusion if they died. When the writers could not come up with something for the Winchesters to be doing while Meg is on the loose, they split the episode into two stories; John would go after Meg while the brothers protect another family from Azazel. Tucker felt that this opened \\"all this emotional stuff with the guys\\", as well as \\"brought back all the themes of the show and tied the season up into a nice big bow\\".[58] Similarly, Kripke believed that the revelation of John being possessed by Azazel in \\"Devil's Trap\\" had to be, as it completed the two main storylines of the seasonfinding their father and tracking down the demonat the same time, but had them find both characters in one body.[59]\\r\\nWhile supernatural and urban legends inspired many episodes, some storyline aspects were influenced by popular culture. The inspiration for the wendigo's appearance in \\"Wendigo\\" came from the creature featured in the music video for the Aphex Twin song \\"Come to Daddy\\". Human features were added to the design due the wendigo's human origins, and the creature was given the ability to mimic human voices to create a \\"creepy effect\\".[60] However, Kripke was not pleased with the final appearance of the wendigo, deeming him as \\"Gollum's tall, gangly cousin\\". Because of this, the creature is not seen throughout most of the episode.[61] For shapeshifting scenes in the episode \\"Skin\\", Kripke chose to base the transformation on that of An American Werewolf in London, using prosthetics and makeup rather than computer-generated imagery.[62] The Ring's Samara influenced the titular villain in \\"Bloody Mary\\", though Kripke felt that she ended up looking too similar to the character due to her grisly appearance and the use of speed ramping to create a time-manipulation effect. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden, on the other hand, believes it was more of an homage.[63]\\r\\nThough the pilot was shot in Los Angeles, principal filming for the rest of the season took place in Vancouver, British Columbia.[64] Local sites often served as shooting locations, with much of \\"Dead in the Water\\" taking place at Buntzen Lake and the climax of \\"Wendigo\\" occurring in a Britannia Beach mine.[65][66] Likewise, Riverview Hospital functioned as a mental institution in \\"Asylum\\".[67] Though production has sometimes recycled sets from other television series\\"The Benders\\" made use of a previously-built Western town,[68] while the warehouse-loft set of \\"Shadow\\" originated from the series Tru Calling[69]most episodes usually require the construction of new sets due to the constant change of setting.[70] The production team, however, created reusable standing sets in the form of the motel rooms frequented by the Winchesters. Each episode presents a different theme to disguise the motel-room set's repeated use, with different colors, bedspreads, and curtains being used. The episode \\"Provenance\\", for instance, displayed a disco-themed motel room.[71]\\r\\nThe mostly synthesized orchestral score of the season was composed by Christopher Lennertz and Jay Gruska.[72] The pair try to base the music on the visuals of each episode,[73] with about a third of each episode's score being newly written for the supernatural legend.[72] For example, off-angle shots in \\"Dead in the Water\\" are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes. As well, spoken words such as \\"water\\" and \\"die\\" are followed by a lower pitch because Lennertz felt it created a \\"gurgly\\" water sound.[73] An electric cello and woodwinds helped to create a big emotional tone in the episode \\"Home\\", with Lennertz feeling that the final cue \\"became a very cinematic musical moment\\".[74] To fit in with the episode's ambiance in \\"Asylum\\", Gruska made the music very subtle; Lennertz felt that it was \\"creepy-crawly\\" like \\"a snake sneaking along the ground\\".[75] Conversely, Lennertz matched the theme of traveling evangelists in \\"Faith\\" by using a small 76-key piano that was damaged and slightly out of tune. He attached small items such as coins and paper clips to the keys to create a rattling noise, making the piano seem \\"old and crappy\\".[76] Lennertz then played \\"bluesy gospel music\\" during the sermon scenes involving the Reapers.[72] Because he felt that there was also a \\"snake-oil salesman vibe\\" to the episode, he included an Armenian duduk due to its association with snake charming.[76] The score of \\"Hell House\\", on the other hand, had a much lighter tone to coincide with the episode's humor. For example, music for the scenes involving the \\"professional\\" ghost hunters used percussion instruments to slightly mimic the Mission: Impossible theme.[77]\\r\\nHowever, recurring characters often have certain musical themes attached to them. For the pilot episode, Lennertz used a piano solo with discordant notes and reverberations to create a \\"really nasty\\"-sounding echo effect for the scenes involving Mary and Jessica's deaths at the hands of the demon Azazel.[78] Lennertz returns to this in \\"Nightmare\\", including it when Sam realizes the connection he shares with the demon and Max.[79] The episode \\"Dead in the Water\\" was the first to use what Kripke feels is the \\"Winchester emotion\\", which involves sorrowful and reverberating piano notes on top of strings. It plays when the brothers make connections with other characters.[73] As well, there are variants of a guitar line used as the \\"humorous brothers' theme\\" in many episodes, including \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Hell House\\", when the brothers are having fun.[77] With Gruska writing Meg Masters' theme for \\"Scarecrow\\", Lennertz reused the music in \\"Shadow\\" but \\"took the scary up a notch\\" to imply to the viewers that she is both \\"more important and more devilish\\" than the other creatures in the episode.[80] For the penultimate episode \\"Salvation\\", Lennertz incorporated musical elements used throughout the season.[81]\\r\\nIn addition to the score, the series makes use of rock songs, with most being selected from Kripke's private collection.[82] Among the many bands featured in the first season are AC/DC, Blue ?yster Cult, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Bad Company. Rock songs are also usually featured in \\"The Road So Far\\" montages at the beginning of select episodes that recap previous events. This was first done with the episode \\"Salvation\\", in which the entire season was recapped to Kansas' \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", with the subsequent episodethe season finaleusing Triumph's \\"Fight the Good Fight\\".\\r\\nTo depict the supernatural aspects of the show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. While various companies were contracted for the Los Angeles-based production of the pilot episode, subsequent episodes being filmed in Vancouver required a new crew to be hired.[84] The company Entity FX performed the visual effects for the pilot episode,[85] with Ivan Hayden taking over as visual effects supervisor for the rest of the season.[86] The crew was required to design all of the external airplane shots in \\"Phantom Traveler\\" from scratch using computer-generated imagery (CGI).[87] As well, they created a time-manipulation effect for the titular villain in \\"Bloody Mary\\" by altering the capture frame rate of the camera.[63] Randy Shymkiw acted as special effects supervisor,[88] and the department found the episode \\"Asylum\\" to be quite a challenge because one scene has the vengeful spirit collapse into dust. They made casts of the character's torso and hands, and had to find the perfect mixture in order to have the casts remain solid but disintegrate when needed.[89]\\r\\nThe visual and special effects departments often overlap, such as in Mary Winchester's death scene in the pilot episode. Because the character is pinned to the ceiling and burned to death, actress Samantha Smith was required to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a papier-mach body was ignited on a fake ceiling.[90] When the burning of the titular creature in the episode \\"Wendigo\\" was not sufficient using special effects, a wire-frame mannequin wrapped in steel wool was then burned, with the scene being composited into the original footage to draw out the wendigo's death.[66] To make it appear that the Hook Man is invisible as he scrapes his hook along the wall for one of the scenes in \\"Hook Man\\", a wire was placed inside plaster walls and then pulled out; the wire later was digitally removed in post-production.[88] In the episode \\"Bugs\\", the cast had to be sealed in a small area with hundreds of bees, and were stung despite wearing special costumes with cuffs sewn into their sleeves and pants.[91] However, the bees did not show up well on camera, so most of them that appear in the final version were added with CGI.[92]\\r\\nIn addition to the digital effects, the series also features stuntwork. Lou Bollo took over as stunt coordinator after the pilot episode,[93] and big scenes often involved the actors, though stunt doubles were used for certain moments. For the final lake scene in \\"Dead in the Water\\", in which Dean must save a boy after he is pulled underwater by a vengeful spirit, Jensen Ackles had to hold onto the young actor as they were pulled down ten feet into the water by divers.[94] The actor portraying the vengeful spirit had to wear a wetsuit under his costume due to the extended period of time he was required to spend in the lake.[95] Ackles and Jared Padalecki performed most of the fight scene featured in \\"Skin\\", and only took four hours to learn the fight choreography. However, stunt doubles were brought in for the scenes in which they are thrown into bookshelves and through a coffee table.[96] For the episode \\"Shadow\\", rather than filming at the exterior location for the scene of Meg Masters being thrown out of a window to the street below, it was decided to not depict the impact, instead having the Winchesters look down at her body after the landing. Thus, filming of it was allowed to take place in the studio using a body double.[97]\\r\\nThroughout filming, various scenes make use of all three effects departments. For scenes involving the floating, fiery spirit of Mary Winchester in \\"Home\\", a small and slim stuntman wearing a fire suit was lit on fire and raised into the air on wires. For the spirit's transition into Mary's normal form, Smith stood in front of a black background with wind blowing onto her, and the two scenes were later combined in post-production.[98] Many aspects went into filming the crash scene in the season finale \\"Devil's Trap\\". For the interior scenes used in the first moments of the Impala being hit, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Padalecki, and Ackles were required to sit in the car, which was in front of a blue screen. A sheet of Lexan placed very close to the passenger-side window protected the actors as the window was shattered, and at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window exploded onto them.[99] For scenes of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled together by a winch, and driven toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to then barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck to go out of control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look \\"pretty real\\".[100]\\r\\nAfter the first four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided to pick up the series for a full season of 22?episodes. During those first episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18ÿ34 and 12ÿ34. It also posted an increase of 73% in males aged 18ÿ49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls.[101] Supernatural's first season averaged about 3.81?million American viewers.[3] According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.[102]\\r\\nOn Metacritic, the season scored 59 out of 100 based on 22 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".[103] The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 69% approval rating with an average rating of 6.8/10 based on 13 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \\"Despite some too-hip dialogue and familiar thematic elements, Supernatural's vigilante brothers manage to stir up some legitimate scares.\\"[104] Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B, saying the show \\"comes off as weekly installments of a horror movie series\\", but that \\"Adding to the show's cred are the '67 Chevy Impala the boys rumble around in and their kick-ass soundtrack\\".[5] Tom Gliatto of People Weekly ranked the show at number five on his list of the Best TV Shows of 2005.[105] Peter Schorn of IGN gave the season a score of 7 out of 10. While he found the self-enclosed episodes to be \\"passably entertaining\\", he enjoyed the story arcs introduced later in the season. Schorn also deemed the \\"stormy relationship between Sam and his father\\" to be \\"compelling\\", and noted that the lead stars have \\"good chemistry together\\".[8] Rick Porter of Zap2it felt that while the season had its \\"share of emotional moments\\", it also \\"[scared] the pants off\\" of viewers \\"surprisingly well\\". He also believed that it did a good job at balancing mythology episodes with self-enclosed ones, comparing it to the early seasons of The X-Files.[7] However, Eric Neigher of Slant Magazine highly criticized the self-enclosed episodes for being \\"almost totally linear, without any B- or C-stories\\", and felt that the episodes were mainly \\"watered-down rehashes of classic weird fiction or popular urban legends\\".[6]\\r\\nWork on the pilot episode garnered two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations in 2006, composer Christopher Lennertz being nominated in the category of \\"Outstanding Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore)\\"[4] and the sound editors receiving a nomination for \\"Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series\\".[4] The pilot episode also brought in a nomination for a Golden Reel Award in the category of \\"Best Sound Editing in Television: Short Form ÿ Sound Effects and Foley\\",[106] with work on the episode \\"Salvation\\" gaining the same nomination in 2007.[107] Additionally, the season was nominated for a Saturn Award in the category of \\"Best Network Television Series\\".[108] For the Teen Choice Awards, the series was nominated for \\"TV ÿ Choice Breakout Show\\" and Jensen Ackles for \\"TV ÿ Choice Breakout Star\\".[109]\\r\\nThe first season of Supernatural was released as a six-disc Region?1 DVD box set on September 5, 2006, three weeks before the premiere of the second season. The cover art incorporated a stylized shot of the Winchester brothers in front of their car. Including all 22?episodes of the first season, the set also featured DVD extras such as episode commentaries, deleted scenes, bloopers, featurettes, and a DVD-ROM sneak-peek at the second season.[12] The season was ranked No.?14 in DVD sales for its week of release,[110] and slipped to No.?28 the following week, with cumulative sales during those two weeks coming to 150,376?sets for $5,264,942.[111] The set was later packaged with the first season of Smallville as a \\"Season One Starter Pack\\", which was released on September 18, 2007.[112] For Region?2, the season was split into two parts, being released on May 22, 2006,[113] and August 21, 2006;[114] the complete set was released on October 2, 2006.[13] The season was also released in Region?4 on September 6, 2006, though the special features were removed.[115] A \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" was later released on October 2, 2007, with the extras restored.[14] The first season was released on Region A Blu-ray Disc on June 15, 2010, including new special featuresÿ\\"The Devil's Road Map\\", an interactive guide featuring interviews about every episode and a Paley Festival panel discussion featuring the cast and crew.[116]\\r\\nKnight, Nicholas (2007).

The top eight teams in each conference (East and West), ranked in order by win-loss records, qualify for the playoffs. The tie-break criteria for playoff seeding and home-court advantage have also changed; head-to-head results between the tied teams is the first tie-breaker, and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie-breaker.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese seedings are used to create a bracket that determines the match-ups throughout the series. Once the playoffs start, the bracket is fixed; teams are never \\"reseeded\\", unlike in the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) where the strongest remaining teams face the weakest teams in subsequent rounds. The first round of the NBA playoffs, or conference quarterfinals, consists of four match-ups in each conference based on the seedings (1ÿ8, 2ÿ7, 3ÿ6, and 4ÿ5). The four winners advance to the second round, or conference semifinals, with a match-up between the 1ÿ8 and 4ÿ5 winners and a match-up between the 2ÿ7 and 3ÿ6 winners. The two winners advance to the third round, or conference finals. The winner from each conference will advance to the final round, or the NBA Finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll rounds are best-of-seven series. Series are played in a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5ÿ7 being played if needed. This format has been used since 2014, after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change from a 2ÿ3ÿ2 format on October 23, 2013.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common criticism of the current structure is related to parity of conferences. On numerous occasions, Eastern Conference teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs, while Western Conference teams with winning records ended up missing them, including the 2011, 2013 and the 2015 NBA Playoffs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball League but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the 1947 and 1948 BAA Playoffs, were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a best-of-seven series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947 the Philadelphia Warriors won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion Chicago Stags four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1949 the third and last BAA tournament matched Eastern teams exclusively and Western teams exclusively, necessarily generating Eastern and Western playoff champions to meet in the final. At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the 1950 tournament, following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion Minneapolis Lakers became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the Syracuse Nationals in six games.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1951 through 1953 playoffs changed the division finals into a best-of-five playoff. With only nine league members in 1953ÿ54, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). Round robins were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA historya three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith ten league members again for the 1966ÿ67 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff.  Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series were expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven. (Thus all playoff teams from 2003 to present, same as the two Division champions in 1947 and 1948, continue to play at the close of the regular season without idle team (\\"bye\\") and may be certain of four playoff games including two at home.)\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the thirtieth NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005ÿ06 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-four seed, as described below.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous playoff format, in place for the 2004ÿ05 and 2005ÿ06 NBA playoffs, after the NBA was re-aligned into six divisions, created controversy during the 2005ÿ06 season and playoffs, and would be changed prior to the 2006ÿ07 NBA season.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to 2005, NBA division champions were seeded higher than the other teams in their conference, regardless of their record. Prior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds. This meant that top two teams in a conference (by record) would be seeded either first and second (if they were in opposite divisions) or first and third (if they were in the same division). Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference could never meet until the conference finals, assuming they both made it to that round.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions.  However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, they would be seeded first and fourth.  Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second year of this format, the 2005ÿ06 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference, the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks of the Southwest Division, did just that.  The Mavericks had the second-best record in the Western Conference and the third-best record in the entire league, behind the Detroit Pistons and San Antonio.  However, they were seeded fourth because they finished second in the Southwest behind the Spurs.  This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many. Besides the prospect of a team losing earlier in the playoffs than its regular-season record or seeding would suggest, critics claimed that it also created an unfair advantage for teams in the 2-7/3-6 half of the Western Conference playoff bracket, who could advance to the conference finals without playing either of the two best teams in the conference in an earlier round.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Phoenix Suns, winners of the Pacific Division and possessors of the third best record, were seeded second, while the Denver Nuggets, winners of the Northwest Division and tied for only the seventh-best record in the conference, were seeded third.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers met in the second-to-last game of the regular season, after the top four seeds had been clinched. The two teams were already determined to be the fifth and sixth seeds, and had only to determine which rank higher. The fifth seed would likely need to defeat the best two teams in the conference without home-court advantage to advance to the conference finals, as it would face fourth-seeded Dallas in the first round and likely face first-seeded San Antonio if it managed to defeat Dallas. The sixth seed would play third-seeded Denver in the first round, but would have home-court advantage (since the Grizzlies had the fourth-best record in the conference and the Clippers had the fifth-best), and would not have to face either San Antonio or Dallas until the conference finals at the earliest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis led to speculation about whether the Grizzlies or the Clippers would have much commitment to winning their match-up in the second-to-last game of the season, since it was clearly most advantageous to lose the game in order to obtain the 6th seed. The Clippers eventually lost to Memphis without much evidence to support the speculation that the Clippers had lost intentionally.[6] In the first round of the playoffs, the Clippers defeated the Nuggets in five games, while Memphis was swept by Dallas. Ultimately, Dallas and San Antonio did meet in the second round, with Dallas winning in seven games and advancing all the way to the NBA finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-7 (one series)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were no byes, or idle time, for the division champions ÿ as there would be for higher-seeded playoff teams 1955ÿ66 and 1975ÿ83. All six 1947 participants played their first tournament games on Wednesday, April 2; in 1948 the two Eastern runners-up (E2, E3 in the figure) were idle for a few days only because there was a three-way Western tie to break. Both winners of the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia in 1947 and Baltimore in 1948, reached the final series having played fewer tournament games than their final opponents, Chicago in 1947 and Philadelphia in 1948, had played in the best-of-7 pairings of division champions. And both winners of the runners-up bracket won the final series. The \\"postseason\\" actually comprised 11 games played in a span of 21 days for the 1947 Chicago Stags and 13 games in 30 days for 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, the finalists who emerged from the pairing of division champions.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-5 (1961ÿ1966)\\r\\n\\r\\nBest-of-7 (1958ÿ1966)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1961 to 1966 tournaments alone combined initial byes for seeded teams with best-of-five initial series for unseeded teams. The 1961 byes provided five and seven extra days idle for the first-place teams.

Apart from a very uncertain process used on the Turin Shroud there are no artifacts or descriptions that indicate that anyone even imagined capturing images with light sensitive materials before the 18th century. Around 1717 Johann Heinrich Schulze captured cut-out letters on a bottle of a light-sensitive slurry, but he apparently never thought of making the results durable. Around 1800 Thomas Wedgwood made the first reliably documented, although unsuccessful attempt at capturing camera images in permanent form. His experiments did produce detailed photograms, but Wedgwood and his associate Humphry Davy found no way to fix these images.\\r\\nIn the mid-1820s, Nicphore Nipce first managed to fix an image that was captured with a camera, but at least eight hours or even several days of exposure in the camera were required and the earliest results were very crude. Nipce's associate Louis Daguerre went on to develop the daguerreotype process, the first publicly announced and commercially viable photographic process. The daguerreotype required only minutes of exposure in the camera, and produced clear, finely detailed results. The details were introduced as a gift to the world in 1839, a date generally accepted as the birth year of practical photography.[1][2] The metal-based daguerreotype process soon had some competition from the paper-based calotype negative and salt print processes invented by William Henry Fox Talbot. Subsequent innovations made photography easier and more versatile. New materials reduced the required camera exposure time from minutes to seconds, and eventually to a small fraction of a second; new photographic media were more economical, sensitive or convenient, including roll films for casual use by amateurs. In the mid-20th century, developments made it possible for amateurs to take pictures in natural color as well as in black-and-white.\\r\\nThe commercial introduction of computer-based electronic digital cameras in the 1990s soon revolutionized photography. During the first decade of the 21st century, traditional film-based photochemical methods were increasingly marginalized as the practical advantages of the new technology became widely appreciated and the image quality of moderately priced digital cameras was continually improved. Especially since cameras became a standard feature on smartphones, taking pictures (and instantly publishing them online) has become an ubiquitous everyday practice around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coining of the word \\"photography\\" is usually attributed to Sir John Herschel in 1839. It is based on the Greek ?? (phs), (genitive: pht܇s) meaning \\"light\\", and ϫ? (graph), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".[3]\\r\\nA natural phenomenon, known as camera obscura or pinhole image, can project a (reversed) image through a small opening onto an opposite surface. This principle may have been known and used in prehistoric times. The earliest known written record of the camera obscura is to be found in Chinese writings called Mozi, dated to the 4th century BCE. Until the 16th century the camera obscura was mainly used to study optics and astronomy, especially to safely watch solar eclipses without damaging the eyes. In the later half of the 16th century some technical improvements were developed: a (biconvex) lens in the opening (first described by Gerolamo Cardano in 1550) and a diaphragm restricting the aperture (Daniel Barbaro in 1568) gave a brighter and sharper image. In 1558 Giambattista della Porta advised using the camera obscura as a drawing aid in his popular and influential books. Della Porta's advice was widely adopted by artists and since the 17th century portable versions of the camera obscura were commonly used - first as a tent, later as boxes. The box type camera obscura was the basis for the earliest photographic cameras when photography was developed in the early 19th century.\\r\\nThe notion that light can affect various substances - for instance the suntanning of skin or fading of textile - must have been around since very early times. Ideas of fixing the image seen in mirrors or other ways of creating images automatically may also have been in people's mind long before anything like photography was developed.[4] However, there seem to be no historical records of any ideas even remotely resembling photography before 1725, despite early knowledge of light-sensitive materials and the camera obscura.[5]\\r\\nIt has been suggested that some lost type of photographic technology must have been applied before 1357: the Shroud of Turin contains an image that resembles a sepia photographic negative and is much clearer when it is converted to a positive image. The actual method that resulted in this image has not yet been conclusively identified. It first appeared in historical records in 1357 and radiocarbon dating tests indicate it was probably made between 1260 and 1390.[6] No other examples of detailed negative images from before the 19th century are known.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlbertus Magnus (1193/1206ÿ80) discovered silver nitrate and noted that it could blacken skin.[7] Silver nitrate would later be used as a light sensitive material in the photographic emulsion on photographic glass plates and film.\\r\\nGeorg Fabricius (1516ÿ71) discovered silver chloride, later used to make photographic paper.[8]\\r\\nIn 1614 Angelo Sala wrote in his paper Septem Planetarum terrestrium Spagirica recensio[9]: \\"When you expose powdered silver nitrate to sunlight, it turns black as ink\\". He also noted that paper wrapped around silver nitrate for a year had turned black.[10]\\r\\nWilhelm Homberg described how light darkened some chemicals (photochemical effect) in 1694.[8]\\r\\nAround 1717[11] German polymath Johann Heinrich Schulze accidentally discovered that a slurry of chalk and nitric acid into which some silver particles had been dissolved was darkened by sunlight. After experiments with threads that had created lines on the bottled substance after he placed it in direct sunlight for a while, he applied stencils of words to the bottle. The stencils produced copies of the text in dark red, almost violet characters on the surface of the otherwise whitish contents. The impressions persisted until they were erased by shaking the bottle or until overall exposure to light obliterated them. Schulze named the substance \\"Scotophorus\\", when he published his findings in 1719. He thought the discovery could be applied to detect whether metals or minerals contained any silver and hoped that further experimentation by others would lead to some other useful results.[12][13] Schulze's process resembled later photogram techniques and is sometimes regarded as the very first form of photography.[14]\\r\\nThe early science fiction novel Giphantie[15] (1760) by the French Tiphaigne de la Roche described something quite similar to (colour) photography, a process that fixes fleeting images formed by rays of light:\\"They coat a piece of canvas with this material, and place it in front of the object to capture. The first effect of this cloth is similar to that of a mirror, but by means of its viscous nature the prepared canvas, as is not the case with the mirror, retains a facsimile of the image. The mirror represents images faithfully, but retains none; our canvas reflects them no less faithfully, but retains them all. This impression of the image is instantaneous. The canvas is then removed and deposited in a dark place. An hour later the impression is dry, and you have a picture the more precious in that no art can imitate its truthfulness.\\"[16] De la Roche thus imagined a process that made use of a special substance in combination with the qualities of a mirror, rather than the camera obscura. The hour of drying in a dark place suggests he possibly thought about the light sensitivity of the material, but he attributes the effect to its viscous nature.\\r\\nIn 1777, the chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele was studying the more intrinsically light-sensitive silver chloride and determined that light darkened it by disintegrating it into microscopic dark particles of metallic silver. Of greater potential usefulness, Scheele found that ammonia dissolved the silver chloride but not the dark particles. This discovery could have been used to stabilize or \\"fix\\" a camera image captured with silver chloride, but was not picked up by the earliest photography experimenters.[citation needed]\\r\\nScheele also noted that red light did not have much effect on silver chloride (a feature that would later be applied to be able to see while printing black and white photographs in darkrooms).[17]\\r\\nAlthough Thomas Wedgwood felt inspired by Scheele's writings in general, he must have missed or forgotten these experiments: he found no method to fix the photogram and shadow images he managed to capture around 1800 (see below).[17]\\r\\nThomas Wedgwood (1771-1805) is believed to have been the first person to have thought of creating permanent pictures by capturing camera images on material coated with a light-sensitive chemical. He originally wanted to capture the images of a camera obscura, but found they were too faint to have an effect upon the silver nitrate solution that was advised to him as a light-sensitive substance. Wedgwood did manage to copy painted glass plates and captured shadows on white leather as well as on paper moistened with a silver nitrate solution. Attempts to preserve the results with their \\"distinct tints of brown or black, sensibly differing in intensity\\" failed. It is unclear when Wedgwood's experiments took place. He may have started before 1790; James Watt wrote a letter to Thomas Wedgwood's father Josiah Wedgwood to thank him \\"for your instructions as to the Silver Pictures, about which, when at home, I will make some experiments\\". This letter (now lost) is believed to have been written in 1790, 1791 or 1799. In 1802 an account by Humphry Davy detailing Wedgwood's experiments was published in an early journal of the Royal Institution with the title An Account of a Method of Copying Paintings upon Glass, and of Making Profiles, by the Agency of Light upon Nitrate of Silver. Davy added that the method could be used for objects that are partly opaque and partly transparent to create accurate representations of for instance \\"the woody fibres of leaves and the wings of insects\\". He also found that solar microscope images of small objects were easily captured on prepared paper. Davy, apparently unaware or forgetful about Scheele's discovery, concluded that substances should be found to get rid of (or deactivate) the unexposed particles in silver nitrate or silver chloride \\"to render the process as useful as it is elegant\\".[17] Wedgwood may have prematurely abandoned his experiments due to his frail and failing health. He died aged 34 in 1805.\\r\\nDavy seems not to have continued the experiments. Although the journal of the small, infant Royal Institution probably reached its very small group of members, the article eventually must have been read by much more people. It was reviewed by David Brewster in the Edinburgh Magazine in December 1802, appeared in chemistry textbooks as early as 1803, was translated into French, and published in German in 1811. Readers of the article may have been discouraged to find a fixer, because the highly acclaimed scientist Davy had already tried and failed. Apparently the article wasn't noted by Nipce nor Daguerre, and by Talbot only after he had developed his own processes.[17][18]\\r\\nFrench balloonist/professor/inventor Jacques Charles is believed to have captured fleeting negative photograms of silhouettes on light sensitive paper at the start of the 19th century, prior to Westwood. Charles died in 1823 without documenting the process, but purportedly demonstrated it in his lectures at the Louvre. It was not publicized until Fran?ois Arago mentioned it at his introduction of the details of the Daguerreotupe to the world in 1839. He later wrote that the first idea of fixing the images of the camera obscura or the solar microscope with chemical substances belonged to Charles. Later historians probably only built on Arago's information and much later the unsupported year 1780 was attached to it.[19] Since Arago indicated the first years of the 19th century and a date prior to Wedgwood's process published in 1802, this would mean that Charles' demonstrations took place in 1800 or 1801 - assuming Arago was this accurate almost 40 years later.\\r\\nIn 1816 Nicphore Nipce, using paper coated with silver chloride, succeeded in photographing the images formed in a small camera, but the photographs were negatives, darkest where the camera image was lightest and vice versa, and they were not permanent in the sense of being reasonably light-fast; like earlier experimenters, Nipce could find no way to prevent the coating from darkening all over when it was exposed to light for viewing. Disenchanted with silver salts, he turned his attention to light-sensitive organic substances.[21]\\r\\nThe oldest surviving photograph of the image formed in a camera was created by Nipce in 1826 or 1827.[1] It was made on a polished sheet of pewter and the light-sensitive substance was a thin coating of bitumen, a naturally occurring petroleum tar, which was dissolved in lavender oil, applied to the surface of the pewter and allowed to dry before use.[23] After a very long exposure in the camera (traditionally said to be eight hours, but now believed to be several days),[24] the bitumen was sufficiently hardened in proportion to its exposure to light that the unhardened part could be removed with a solvent, leaving a positive image with the light areas represented by hardened bitumen and the dark areas by bare pewter.[23] To see the image plainly, the plate had to be lit and viewed in such a way that the bare metal appeared dark and the bitumen relatively light.[21]\\r\\nIn partnership, Nipce in Chalon-sur-Sa?ne and Louis Daguerre in Paris refined the bitumen process,[25] substituting a more sensitive resin and a very different post-exposure treatment that yielded higher-quality and more easily viewed images. Exposure times in the camera, although substantially reduced, were still measured in hours.[21]\\r\\nNipce died suddenly in 1833, leaving his notes to Daguerre. More interested in silver-based processes than Nipce had been, Daguerre experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like silver-surfaced plate that had been fumed with iodine vapor, which reacted with the silver to form a coating of silver iodide. As with the bitumen process, the result appeared as a positive when it was suitably lit and viewed. Exposure times were still impractically long until Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that an invisibly slight or \\"latent\\" image produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be \\"developed\\" to full visibility by mercury fumes. This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum conditions. A strong hot solution of common salt served to stabilize or fix the image by removing the remaining silver iodide. On 7 January 1839, this first complete practical photographic process was announced at a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences,[26] and the news quickly spread.[27] At first, all details of the process were withheld and specimens were shown only at Daguerre's studio, under his close supervision, to Academy members and other distinguished guests.[28] Arrangements were made for the French government to buy the rights in exchange for pensions for Nipce's son and Daguerre and present the invention to the world (with the exception of Great Britain, where an agent for Daguerre patented it) as a free gift.[29] Complete instructions were made public on 19 August 1839.[30] Known as the Daguerreotype process, it was the most common commercial process until the late 1850s. It was superseded by the collodion process.\\r\\nAfter reading early reports of Daguerre's invention, Henry Fox Talbot, who had succeeded in creating stabilized photographic negatives on paper in 1835, worked on perfecting his own process. In early 1839, he acquired a key improvement, an effective fixer, from his friend John Herschel, a polymath scientist who had previously shown that hyposulfite of soda (commonly called \\"hypo\\" and now known formally as sodium thiosulfate) would dissolve silver salts.[31] News of this solvent also benefited Daguerre, who soon adopted it as a more efficient alternative to his original hot salt water method.[32]\\r\\nTalbot's early silver chloride \\"sensitive paper\\" experiments required camera exposures of an hour or more. In 1841, Talbot invented the calotype process, which, like Daguerre's process, used the principle of chemical development of a faint or invisible \\"latent\\" image to reduce the exposure time to a few minutes. Paper with a coating of silver iodide was exposed in the camera and developed into a translucent negative image. Unlike a daguerreotype, which could only be copied by rephotographing it with a camera, a calotype negative could be used to make a large number of positive prints by simple contact printing. The calotype had yet another distinction compared to other early photographic processes, in that the finished product lacked fine clarity due to its translucent paper negative. This was seen as a positive attribute for portraits because it softened the appearance of the human face[citation needed]. Talbot patented this process,[33] which greatly limited its adoption, and spent many years pressing lawsuits against alleged infringers. He attempted to enforce a very broad interpretation of his patent, earning himself the ill will of photographers who were using the related glass-based processes later introduced by other inventors, but he was eventually defeated. Nonetheless, Talbot's developed-out silver halide negative process is the basic technology used by chemical film cameras today. Hippolyte Bayard had also developed a method of photography but delayed announcing it, and so was not recognized as its inventor.\\r\\nIn 1839, John Herschel made the first glass negative, but his process was difficult to reproduce. Slovene Janez Puhar invented a process for making photographs on glass in 1841; it was recognized on June 17, 1852 in Paris by the Acadmie Nationale Agricole, Manufacturire et Commerciale.[34] In 1847, Nicephore Nipce's cousin, the chemist Nipce St. Victor, published his invention of a process for making glass plates with an albumen emulsion; the Langenheim brothers of Philadelphia and John Whipple and William Breed Jones of Boston also invented workable negative-on-glass processes in the mid-1840s.[35]\\r\\nIn 1851 Frederick Scott Archer invented the collodion process.[36] Photographer and children's author Lewis Carroll used this process. (Carroll refers to the process as \\"Tablotype\\" [sic] in the story \\"A Photographer's Day Out\\")[37]\\r\\nHerbert Bowyer Berkeley experimented with his own version of collodion emulsions after Samman introduced the idea of adding dithionite to the pyrogallol developer.[citation needed] Berkeley discovered that with his own addition of sulfite, to absorb the sulfur dioxide given off by the chemical dithionite in the developer, that dithionite was not required in the developing process. In 1881 he published his discovery. Berkeley's formula contained pyrogallol, sulfite and citric acid. Ammonia was added just before use to make the formula alkaline. The new formula was sold by the Platinotype Company in London as Sulpho-Pyrogallol Developer.[38]\\r\\nNineteenth-century experimentation with photographic processes frequently became proprietary.The German-born, New Orleans photographer Theodore Lilienthal successfully sought legal redress in an 1881 infringement case involving his \\"Lambert Process\\" in the Eastern District of Louisiana.\\r\\nThe daguerreotype proved popular in response to the demand for portraiture that emerged from the middle classes during the Industrial Revolution.[citation needed] This demand, which could not be met in volume and in cost by oil painting, added to the push for the development of photography.\\r\\nRoger Fenton and Philip Henry Delamotte helped popularize the new way of recording events, the first by his Crimean war pictures, the second by his record of the disassembly and reconstruction of The Crystal Palace in London. Other mid-nineteenth-century photographers established the medium as a more precise means than engraving or lithography of making a record of landscapes and architecture: for example, Robert Macpherson's broad range of photographs of Rome, the interior of the Vatican, and the surrounding countryside became a sophisticated tourist's visual record of his own travels.\\r\\nIn America, by 1851 a broadside by daguerreotypist Augustus Washington was advertising prices ranging from 50 cents to $10.[39] However, daguerreotypes were fragile and difficult to copy. Photographers encouraged chemists to refine the process of making many copies cheaply, which eventually led them back to Talbot's process.\\r\\nUltimately, the photographic process came about from a series of refinements and improvements in the first 20 years. In 1884 George Eastman, of Rochester, New York, developed dry gel on paper, or film, to replace the photographic plate so that a photographer no longer needed to carry boxes of plates and toxic chemicals around. In July 1888 Eastman's Kodak camera went on the market with the slogan \\"You press the button, we do the rest\\". Now anyone could take a photograph and leave the complex parts of the process to others, and photography became available for the mass-market in 1901 with the introduction of the Kodak Brownie.\\r\\nDaguerreotype cameras were advertised in Calcutta a year after their invention in France  but photographic societies in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras were beginning to pop up from the 1850s onward. [40] As the practice of photography evolved, a contrasting style developed alongside the predominantly European influence on the art form. This turn is most notable in the work of Raja Deen Dayal, Indias most celebrated 19th-century photographer, whose appointment as court photographer to the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad allowed him unique access to the inner circles of aristocratic life. [41]\\r\\nPerhaps Mrs. E. Mayer holds the distinction of being the first professional woman photographer in India. She opened a studio in 7 Old Court House Street Corner to provide a rare treat to Indian women: to be photographed without fear or concern. [42]\\r\\nA practical means of color photography was sought from the very beginning. Results were demonstrated by Edmond Becquerel as early as 1848, but exposures lasting for hours or days were required and the captured colors were so light-sensitive they would only bear very brief inspection in dim light.\\r\\nThe first durable color photograph was a set of three black-and-white photographs taken through red, green, and blue color filters and shown superimposed by using three projectors with similar filters. It was taken by Thomas Sutton in 1861 for use in a lecture by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who had proposed the method in 1855.[43] The photographic emulsions then in use were insensitive to most of the spectrum, so the result was very imperfect and the demonstration was soon forgotten. Maxwell's method is now most widely known through the early 20th century work of Sergei Prokudin-Gorskii. It was made practical by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel's 1873 discovery of a way to make emulsions sensitive to the rest of the spectrum, gradually introduced into commercial use beginning in the mid-1880s.\\r\\nTwo French inventors, Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros, working unknown to each other during the 1860s, famously unveiled their nearly identical ideas on the same day in 1869. Included were methods for viewing a set of three color-filtered black-and-white photographs in color without having to project them, and for using them to make full-color prints on paper.[44]\\r\\nThe first widely used method of color photography was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumire began working on in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907.[45] It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together in the eye and produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs.\\r\\nAutochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then through the use of a rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.[45][46]\\r\\nCompeting screen plate products soon appeared and film-based versions were eventually made. All were expensive and until the 1930s none was \\"fast\\" enough for hand-held snapshot-taking, so they mostly served a niche market of affluent advanced amateurs.\\r\\nA new era in color photography began with the introduction of Kodachrome film, available for 16?mm home movies in 1935 and 35?mm slides in 1936. It captured the red, green, and blue color components in three layers of emulsion. A complex processing operation produced complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images in those layers, resulting in a subtractive color image. Maxwell's method of taking three separate filtered black-and-white photographs continued to serve special purposes into the 1950s and beyond, and Polachrome, an \\"instant\\" slide film that used the Autochrome's additive principle, was available until 2003, but the few color print and slide films still being made in 2015 all use the multilayer emulsion approach pioneered by Kodachrome.\\r\\nIn 1957, a team led by Russell A. Kirsch at the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed a binary digital version of an existing technology, the wirephoto drum scanner, so that alphanumeric characters, diagrams, photographs and other graphics could be transferred into digital computer memory. One of the first photographs scanned was a picture of Kirsch's infant son Walden. The resolution was 176x176 pixels with only one bit per pixel, i.e., stark black and white with no intermediate gray tones, but by combining multiple scans of the photograph done with different black-white threshold settings, grayscale information could also be acquired.[47]\\r\\nThe charge-coupled device (CCD) is the image-capturing optoelectronic component in first-generation digital cameras. It was invented in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith at AT&T Bell Labs as a memory device. The lab was working on the Picturephone and on the development of semiconductor bubble memory. Merging these two initiatives, Boyle and Smith conceived of the design of what they termed \\"Charge 'Bubble' Devices\\". The essence of the design was the ability to transfer charge along the surface of a semiconductor. It was Dr. Michael Tompsett from Bell Labs however, who discovered that the CCD could be used as an imaging sensor. The CCD has increasingly been replaced by the active pixel sensor (APS), commonly used in cell phone cameras. These mobile phone cameras are used by billions of people worldwide, dramatically increasing photographic activity and material and also fueling citizen journalism.\\r\\nThe web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes). Today sites and apps such as Flickr, Picasa, Instagram, Imgur and PhotoBucket are used by many millions of people to share their pictures.","input":"When was the very first photograph ever taken?"},{"output":"more than 12 percent","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia is the most populated U.S. state, with an estimated population of 39.497 million as of 2017.[1] It has people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, national, and religious backgrounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia is the most populated sub-national entity in North America.

Non-Hispanic whites decreased from about 76.3 - 78% of the state's population in 1970[19] to 38.0% in 2015.[20] While the population of minorities accounts for 100.7 million of 300 million U.S. residents, 20% of the national total live in California.[21][22]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the highest number, and second highest percentage, of Asian Americans by state. Only Hawaii has a higher Asian American percentage than California. While New Mexico and Texas have higher percentages of Hispanics, California has the highest total number of Hispanics of any U.S. state. Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in the state.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest named ancestries in California are Mexican (25%), German (9%), Irish (7.7%), English (7.4%) and Italian (5.8%); there are 65 other ethnicities with sizable populations in California including Albanians, Australians, Canadians, Haitians, and Somalis as examples. Both Los Angeles and San Francisco have large numbers of residents with English, French, Italian, German, Russian and Scandinavian ancestry.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the largest population of White Americans in the U.S., totaling 21,453,934 residents as of the 2010 census. The state has the fifth largest population of African Americans in the U.S., an estimated 2,299,072 residents. California's Asian population is estimated at 4.9 million, approximately one-third of the nation's estimated 15 million Asian Americans. California's Native American population of 285,512 is the third-largest of any state, behind Arizona and Oklahoma.[24] Other estimates place the Native American population of California at one million.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 2000 (US Census), California has been known as the second state in US history (after Hawaii since its statehood in 1959) to have a non-white majority, the first state in US history to have a Latino minority,[clarification needed] and since 2014, the first state to have a Latino plurality surpass other racial/ethnic groups. The media discussed the possibility of Latinos becoming a majority in the 21st century,[25] the first time since statehood (1850) when they were reduced to 20 percent of the population as a result of the California Gold Rush of 1848-49. \\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the largest population of European Americans of any state.  For example, in 2000 California had more Bulgarian Americans, Romanian Americans and Hungarian Americans than any other U.S. state. Los Angeles and San Francisco have large Russian American or Russian populations, as well Ukrainian Americans; and a long history of English, Irish, Italian, German, and Polish communities established by immigrants in the late 19th century. There are also many English Americans, Irish Americans, and French Americans whose ancestors were the original 49ers, also known as the California Gold Rush immigrants. There are also immigrant communities from the former Yugoslavia such as Bosnians, Croatians, and Serbians.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has over one million residents each with Spanish or Portuguese ancestry[citation needed], with communities along coastal parts of the state such as San Diego, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Clara Valley (including Cupertino, Gilroy and San Jose), Salinas Valley, Santa Maria Valley, and San Joaquin Valley. A small wave of Danish, Dutch and Swedish immigrants founded towns like Lathrop near Stockton, Artesia near Los Angeles, Kingsburg south of Fresno, Solvang north of Santa Barbara in the late 1800s and the private community of Sveadal located 15 miles south of San Jose and populated entirely by members of the Swedish American Patriotic League.[26] Small colonies of early 19th century Russian settlement under the Russian American Company are in Fort Ross,[27] Calistoga and the Russian River Valley in Sonoma and Napa counties. Small Amish/Mennonite colonies exist in an area bordered by the towns Oakdale, Riverbank and Ripon near Modesto and in Reedley, Sanger and Orange Cove near Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley; and in the outer Salinas Valley.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state also has over 2000 Circassian Americans with a little community in Anaheim.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatinos, mainly Mexican Americans, form major portions of the population of Southern California, especially in Los Angeles, as well as the San Joaquin Valley. The city of Los Angeles is often said to be the largest Mexican community in the United States. Census records kept track of the growth since 1850, but Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have lived in California since Spanish Colonial times. However, the number and percentage population of Latinos living in California increased rapidly in the late 20th century. The result is that, today, Latinos are the largest ethnic group in Los Angeles County, at over 40 percent of the county's population. Latinos are predominantly concentrated in the older eastern and southern suburbs surrounding downtown Los Angeles and northern Long Beach, the southern/eastern San Fernando Valley, and the San Gabriel/Pomona Valleys. They also comprise sizable communities in Arvin, Bakersfield, Delano, El Monte, Fontana, Fresno, Indio, La Puente, Ontario, Oxnard, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Jos, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Stockton, Vallejo and Yuba City. In Santa Ana in Orange County, Latinos comprise 75 percent of the population. Nearby Anaheim is over half Latino, and Orange County's population is 30-35 percent Latino.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Imperial Valley on the U.S.-Mexican border is about 70ÿ75% Latino; communities with many Latinos can also be found in Riverside County, especially at its eastern end, and the Coachella Valley. The Central Valley has many Mexican American migrant farm workers. Latinos are the majority in 14 counties: Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Tulare and Yolo counties.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatinos make up at least 20% of the San Francisco Bay Area. Many live in San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties, as well in San Francisco. The Napa Valley and Salinas Valley have predominantly Latino communities established by migrant farm workers. San Jose is about 30-35 percent Latino, the largest Latino community in northern California, while the Mission District, San Francisco and Lower/West Oakland has barrios established by Mexican and Latin American immigrants. The Mexican American communities of East Los Angeles and Logan Heights, San Diego, as well the San Joaquin Valley are centers of historic Chicano and Latino cultures.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia also has the largest populations of Hispanics/Latinos in the country. Most of the state's Latinos have Mexican ancestry, having the largest Mexican population in the United States, making up about 31 percent of the state population. California has a large and diverse population, having the largest Central American, especially Salvadorans population in the United States. Guatemalan Americans are spread out in Southern California after previously centered in Los Angeles between 1970 and 2010. California also has many Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, Honduran Americans, and Nicaraguan Americans, along with people of Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian and other South American ancestry. Los Angeles has had the United States' largest Central American community, as well as the largest Mexican American community, since the 1910s. In fact, the 1900 census record finds 319 to 619 out of 100,000 residents in the city of Los Angeles were \\"Spanish\\" or \\"Mexican\\". (see Demographics of Los Angeles). Nearly 31 percent of Los Angeles itself is of Mexican descent, having the largest Mexican population of any city in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Mariposa County, there is a very small community of Californios or Spanish American people as they identify themselves, that dates back before the U.S. annexation of California. Hornitos is home to an estimated 1,000 people and many are \\"Californios\\". The community's \\"Spanish\\" Californio culture is closely linked with Mexico and other Latin American nations. Spanish colonial/Mexican/Latino influences was always a major part of California after it became part of the U.S. since 1848 and its statehood in 1850.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has a long history of established Asian American communities, including Chinese since the 1850s, Japanese since the 1880s, and Filipinos for over a century. A large wave of Asian immigration since 1965 brought in more Chinese along with Koreans and Southeast Asians after the Vietnam war ended in the late 1970s. South Asians are also a fast-growing group.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 2010 Census there were a total of 17,941,286 respondents who claimed to be Asian American and Asian.[29] Out of these respondents in the United States,[30] 30.9% live in California, with 5,556,592 Asian Americans being counted by the 2010 Census.[31] This is a 1.5 million growth in population from the 2000 census, making Asian Americans 14.9 percent of the state's population.[32] Out of those almost 5.6 million Asian Americans in California there are 1,474,707 Filipinos, 1,349,111 Chinese, 647,589 Vietnamese, 590,445 Indians, 505,225 Koreans, 428,140 Japanese, 109,928 Taiwanese, 102,317 Cambodians, 91,224 Hmong, 69,303 Laotians, 67,707 Thais, 53,474 Pakistanis, 39,506 Borneons, Sumatrans, and Indonesians, 17,978 Burmese, 11,929 Sri Lankans, 10,494 Bangladeshis, 6,231 Nepalese, 5,595 Malaysians, 4,993 Mongolians, 1,513 Singaporeans, 1,377 Okinawans, and 750 Bhutanese.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nFilipino Americans are particularly numerous in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego, San Mateo and Solano counties, and in southern California communities such as Artesia, Baldwin Park, Carson, Cerritos, Covina, West Covina, and the Eagle Rock district of Los Angeles. Around San Diego, many Filipinos live in the communities of Mira Mesa, National City, and Chula Vista. Delano near Bakersfield, other towns in the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire of Riverside-San Bernardino, Coachella Valley-Imperial Valley region, Salinas, Stockton and Lathrop, and the Santa Maria/San Luis Obispo area also have large Filipino American populations. Daly City south of San Francisco has a large Filipino population and is the largest percentage wise in the United States. As of the 1980s, Filipinos have been the largest population of Asians in California.[33] Twenty percent of registered nurses, in 2013, in California are Filipino.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese Americans are numerous in San Francisco, Oakland, the East Bay, South Bay, the Central Coast of California, Sacramento, San Diego, and the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County. The San Francisco Bay Area has a greater concentration of Cantonese-speaking Chinese than any other region in the United States. The Mexican border community of Calexico, California in addition to Mexicali has large numbers of Chinese Mexican Americans, that is, Mexican Americans of Chinese ancestry. Smaller Chinese communities can also be found in San Jacinto Valley, Lake Elsinore, and Victorville.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthern California has perhaps the largest Taiwan-born Chinese American community in the U.S., particularly in the San Gabriel Valley (i.e. Walnut and Diamond Bar), Buena Park, Cerritos, West Covina, Irvine, communities in the South Bay, Los Angeles and southern Orange County. Many minority groups from China also live in California, for example, there are Tibetan, Mongolian and Uygur Americans concentrated in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Orange County, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach area.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarge Korean American communities exist in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles, the eastern San Gabriel Valley, the San Fernando Valley, Cerritos/Long Beach, South Bay, Los Angeles, northern Orange County and San Diego area. There is another large Korean American population in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Koreans are growing in number in the suburban Inland Empire region, in cities such as Chino Hills, Corona, Desert Hot Springs and Loma Linda south of San Bernardino. Since 1990, the Korean American and African American populations relocated westward and northward in the Los Angeles area.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Bay area and Little Tokyo have a large Japanese American community. Japanese Americans, however, are also concentrated in San Francisco and across the Bay Area, San Jose, the Salinas Valley and Santa Cruz County; and smaller communities in the Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield, Anaheim, San Diego, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Stockton areas. Despite the presence of Japanese goods stores, media outlets and restaurants in the state, most \\"Little Tokyos\\" and \\"Japantowns\\" were evacuated during the forced relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II (see Japanese American Internment). As a result, most Japanese Americans in urban areas do not reside in historical Japanese communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the largest American population of Southeast Asians, concentrated in the Los Angeles-Long Beach, Sacramento, and Fresno areas. This includes the Hmong and Vietnamese, including Chinese Vietnamese. Long Beach has one of the largest Cambodian American communities in the United States. The neighboring cities of Westminster and Garden Grove have the largest Vietnamese American community outside of Vietnam and are often dubbed \\"Little Saigon\\". Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants also settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, as well across the San Joaquin Valley and in San Diego.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 6,000 Laotian Americans live in the Fresno area, including an even larger Hmong American community, the second-largest of its kind. Other Hmong colonies in the Central Valley of California and Northern California developed since the end of the Vietnam war (1975ÿ79).\\r\\nCalifornia also has a Thai American community of over 250,000, concentrated in Southern California, with small Thai and Southeast Asian communities in Perris and Banning in the Inland Empire region. Los Angeles has the largest Thai population outside of Thailand and is also home to the world's first Thai Town. About 150,000 Indonesians live in Southern California, primarily the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the largest Indian American population in the U.S. Many live in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The Los Angeles suburbs of Artesia and Cerritos have large Indian American communities. San Jose, Fremont, and other Silicon Valley cities have many Indian Americans who are employed in the high-tech industry. Many Indian Americans are in Central Valley cities such as Stockton, Bakersfield, Fresno, Yuba City, and the Imperial Valley. Most South Asians in California are Indian American, but there are also Pakistani Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, and Sri Lankan Americans (see Sinhalese and Tamils) esp. concentrated in the San Gabriel Valley (Covina Valley) of the Los Angeles area.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 50,000 Afghan Americans are concentrated in the East Bay primarily in Alameda County and its communities of Fremont and Hayward; Afghans also live throughout the state (esp. Orange County and Ventura County).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe state has 150,000 residents with Pacific Islander ancestry. Most, 80,000, are Native Hawaiians of measurable Polynesian ancestry; many also have Asian, European, or other ancestries. There are also 25,000 Samoan Americans originally from American Samoa or Western Samoa.  Most live in Long Beach and the Los Angeles suburbs of Carson, Artesia, Cerritos, and Redondo Beach, Oceanside, and Upland. About 10,000 Chamorros from Guam and Northern Mariana Islands live in northern California, the largest Micronesian community in the mainland United States. An estimated 10,000 Tahitians from French Polynesia live in southern California.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also many Palauans in southern California, specifically in the San Diego area, including Vista. Only 677 in Vista alone in the 2010 US Census. Members of the Palauan community often also have Malay, Indonesian, Micronesian, Melanesian, Japanese, and other east Asian ancestries.  Many Chuukese or Trukese live in San Diego, while the original settlers on Truk Island are Spanish and German but most Truukese now are Japanese and Korean, then Filipino and some Chinese, and finally the arrival of American expatriates. Many came to the Oceanside area due to the military installations around the city, which has the oldest Polynesian or Pacific Islander community. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe state also has over 715,000 Arab Americans, with large communities in Alameda, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego, Sacramento and Stanislaus counties. They represent all Arab and Middle Eastern nationalities, the most numerous being of Gaza and West Bank (see Palestinian Americans) followed by those from Syria (see Syrian Americans) and Lebanon (about half- 1.5 out of 3.1 million estimated- (see Lebanese Americans) live in California), Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Arabs have resided in California since the 1920s, most notably in Orange County in the section of Little Arabia (Anaheim, California) and the San Diego area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 500,000 Iranian Americans live throughout Southern California, including about 20% of the population of Beverly Hills.[35] Iranian American communities also flourish in the San Fernando Valley, Orange County, San Diego, the Palm Springs area, and the San Joaquin Valley. The majority of Iranian Americans immigrated after the ouster of the pro-U.S. Shah regime of Iran in the late 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia also has the third largest Greek American population in the United States, behind New York and Massachusetts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also large population of Assyrian/Chaldean descent living in the Central Valley, with large communities in Modesto, Ceres and Turlock, as well as throughout the Central Coast and the California Desert (i.e. the Coachella and Imperial valleys). San Diego has one of the largest concentrations of Chaldean immigrants in the United States.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia is also home to 600,000 Armenian Americans, with many in Glendale north of Los Angeles, as well as a large community in Fresno. As of 1988 California had about 500,000 ethnic Armenians with over half of them living in Greater Los Angeles.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish Americans and Azerbaijani Americans form moderately-sized communities in both Los Angeles and San Francisco.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has 2.3 million African Americans as of 2010, the largest population of Black or African Americans in the western U.S,[18] and the 5th largest Black population in the United States. Cities that have the largest share of African Americans and have historically been Black cultural centers include (11 largest in the state): Compton, Inglewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Richmond, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego and Vallejo.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many other cities and towns in the state with sizeable African American populations. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nBerkeley,\\r\\nDublin,\\r\\nEast Palo Alto,\\r\\nFairfield,\\r\\nHayward,\\r\\nMarin City,\\r\\nPiedmont,\\r\\nSan Leandro,\\r\\nand Suisun City. Bakersfield,\\r\\nFresno,\\r\\nMerced,\\r\\nModesto,\\r\\nand Stockton. Adelanto,\\r\\nAltadena,\\r\\nApple Valley,\\r\\nCalifornia City,\\r\\nCarson,\\r\\nCorona,\\r\\nDesert Hot Springs,\\r\\nFontana,\\r\\nGardena,\\r\\nHawthorne,\\r\\nIndio,\\r\\nLakewood,\\r\\nLancaster,\\r\\nLynwood,\\r\\nMoreno Valley,\\r\\nNational City,\\r\\nOceanside,\\r\\nPalmdale,\\r\\nPalm Springs,\\r\\nPasadena,\\r\\nPerris,\\r\\nPomona,\\r\\nRialto,\\r\\nTwentynine Palms,\\r\\nand Victorville.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican Americans are approximately 7 percent of the state population. The state percentage of African Americans has dropped in the 1990s and 2000s, though the state's overall number of African-Americans has increased in that time period. The black population in East and West Oakland and South Central Los Angeles - places where they held the majority for decades - has greatly decreased as the black middle class has relocated to nearby suburbs, including those in the Inland Empire and Antelope Valley in Southern California and the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California. Many African Americans have also moved to the South, where their grandparents may have come from in the \\"Great Migration\\" of the mid-20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican Americans have made a contribution to the state's hip-hop and R&B music culture. African-American musical artists born and/or raised in California include: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, E-40, Nate Dogg, En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Too Short, Eazy-E, N.W.A, Keyshia Cole, Digital Underground, JJ Fad, Barry White, The Pointer Sisters and Kendrick Lamar. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso noted is California has small West Indian (Afro-Caribbean American) and African immigration from countries such as Cape Verde, Eritrea and Ethiopia (i.e. Little Ethiopia in West Los Angeles), Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa (including White South Africans), Tanzania and Yemen across from the Horn of Africa. They established communities in Los Angeles known for a large Ethiopian community and Oakland/Berkeley (East Bay) as well Nuer refugees from South Sudan migrated to the Sacramento area; and the Cape Verdean community in Solano County and the Santa Clara Valley, and the San Diego area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, California's Native American population of 362,801 was the most of any state.[38] It also has the most Native American tribes, indigenous to the state or not, but the majority of known Californian Indian tribes became extinct in the late 19th century. The U.S. Census includes Latin American Indian, especially immigrants who belonged to indigenous peoples or who have Amerindian heritage from North and South America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cherokee Nation is the largest tribe in the state with a population of 110,000, although the number of Cherokee descendants may surpass 600,000 according to demographers. They are often descendants of Dust Bowl refugees in the 1930s and 1940s who migrated to the state's farming counties and urban areas for jobs. The largest urban American Indian communities are Los Angeles/Long Beach, San Francisco/Oakland, Sacramento, and San Diego areas.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia also has significant populations of the Apache, Choctaw, Creek, Hopi, Zuni, Navajo, Blackfeet, Shoshone, Paiute, Pueblos, Cahuilla and Chumash tribes. The Cahuilla in the Coachella Valley have profited from real estate land leases, and much of Indio and Palm Springs are tribal-owned lands under legal tribal jurisdiction.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2010, 20,379,282 of California residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 10,672,610 spoke Spanish, 1,231,425 Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 796,451 Tagalog, 559,932 Vietnamese, 367,523 Korean, 192,980 Armenian, and Persian was spoken as a main language by 203,770 of the population over the age of five. In total, 14,644,136 of California's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nComparatively, according to the 2007 American Community Survey, 42.6 percent of California's population older than five spoke a language other than English at home, with 73 percent of those also speaking English well or very well, while 9.8 did not speak English at all.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia had the highest concentration of Vietnamese or Chinese speakers in the United States, second highest concentration of Korean or Spanish speakers in the United States, and third highest concentration of Tagalog speakers in the United States.[49] California was historically one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, and is home to more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families.[50][51] A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages of Mexico that are spoken among California farmworkers.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver 200 languages are known to be spoken and read in California, with Spanish used as the state's \\"alternative\\" language. California has more than 100 indigenous languages, making California one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world. All of California's indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.[note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986.[53] However, many state, city, and local government agencies still continue to print official public documents in numerous languages.[54] For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles offers the written exam for the standard C Class driver's license in 31 languages along with English, and the audio exam in 11 languages.[55] The politics of language is a major political issue in the state, especially in regard to language policy controlling the teaching and official use of immigrant languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken English in California since the late 20th Century. This dialect, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from the dialects used in other regions of the country.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the most Roman Catholics in the United States, ahead of New York State, as well as large Protestant, non-religious, Jewish, and Muslim populations. It also has the largest Mormon population outside of Utah.[58] The state also has a large American Jewish community, the largest in the western U.S., mainly concentrated in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento and Palm Springs. It also has large Muslim communities in west Los Angeles, San Diego, Beverly Hills, Orange County, Santa Clara County, and the Modesto area. Religions indigenous to California includes LaVeyan Satanism.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Roman Catholics in California are of Mexican, other Hispanic, Irish, Italian and Filipino ancestry. The population of Catholic Californians is rapidly growing due to the influx of Latin American and Filipino immigrants. In the state, Roman Catholicism is highly represented among non-Hispanic European-Americans, but less represented among non-Hispanic African-Americans. Protestantism is the majority Christian denomination in non-Hispanic black and white groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest Christian denominations in California in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 10,079,310; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 529,575; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 471,119. Jewish congregations had 994,000 adherents, or 3% of the Californian population.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nHinduism, Buddhism, Shint, Sikhism, and Taoism were introduced in part by Asian immigrants. As the twentieth century came to a close, forty percent of all Buddhists in America resided in Southern California. The Los Angeles metropolitan area has become unique in the Buddhist world as the only place where representative organizations of every major school of Buddhism can be found in a single urban center.[61][verification needed] The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Northern California and Hsi Lai Temple in Southern California are two of the largest Buddhist temples in the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has the highest Hindu population in the United States,[62] most of them Indian Americans.[63] Many of the prominent Hindu temples including the Malibu Hindu Temple are located in California.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith almost one million Jews, California has the highest number of Jews of any state except New York. Many of these Jews live in the West Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley regions of Los Angeles. At the present time, one of California's Senators, Dianne Feinstein, is Jewish.  Historic synagogues include Beth Jacob Congregation (Beverly Hills, California), Congregation B'nai Israel (Sacramento, California), and Temple Israel (Stockton, California). Chabad,[64] The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute,[65] and Aish HaTorah are active in California.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia also has the largest Muslim community in the United States, an estimated one percent of the population, mostly residing in Southern California. Approximately 100,000 Muslims reside in San Diego.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia has more members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Temples than any state except Utah.[66] Latter-day Saints (Mormons) have played important roles in the settlement of California throughout the state's history. For example, a group of a few hundred Mormon converts from the Northeastern United States and Europe arrived at what would become San Francisco in the 1840s aboard the ship Brooklyn, more than doubling the population of the small town. A group of Mormons also established the city of San Bernardino in Southern California in 1851.[58] According to the LDS Church 2014 statistics, 780,200 Mormons reside in the state of California, attending almost 1400 congregations statewide.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church is headquartered in Loma Linda in San Bernardino county 60 miles east of Los Angeles, where the church members form the majority of the town's population. The SDA church there has a university, a free hospital and a TV station (3ABN or the 3 Angels Broadcasting Network). Seventh-day Adventists are vegetarians, so you would notice there are no fast food restaurants within the town limits. The town is known for a large number of centenarians who live over 100 years of age.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed, however, that California is less religious than the rest of the United States: 62% of Californians say they are \\"absolutely certain\\" of the belief \\"in God or a universal spirit\\", while in the nation 71% say so. The survey also revealed that 48% of Californians say religion is \\"very important\\", while the figure for the U.S. in general is 56%.[68] The state's non-religious, which consists of atheists, agnostics, and non-affiliated theists, is one of the fastest-growing groups in the state.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nCathedral Basilica of St. Joseph in San Jose\\r\\n\\r\\nMission San Diego de Alcal\\r\\n\\r\\nHsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles County\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Indian style Malibu Hindu Temple\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Indian style BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Chino Hills\\r\\n\\r\\nCalifornia's income distribution is quite broad; compared to the U.S. as a whole, California has relatively more residents with no income and with income over $100,000. Low incomes combine with high housing and living costs to produce a California poverty rate much higher than that of the U.S. as a whole. Calculated by comparing household income to a locally-adjusted poverty threshold, the Census Bureaus Supplemental Poverty Measure reports that 20.7% of California's population has income insufficient for their basic needs, as compared to 12.9% in the U.S. as a whole.[69] This calculation of income includes the benefits of California welfare programs such as food stamps and earned income tax credits  without these income transfers, California's poverty rate would be 28%. In other words, of the people receiving a 1ÿ2G poverty level income with benefits, about one quarter would fall below the poverty level without benefits.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trends and patterns of low income in California are complex and diverse, yet some of the most dramatic can be seen in census and tax data. From 1975 to 2014 real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have fallen for all but the highest earners (those in the top 20th percentile). This pattern is volatile  in some years lower incomes grew, in some they fell sharply  but on average the bottom 20th percentile has seen a decrease in income of 1% per year.[71][72] Correspondingly, the percent of Californians with income below their poverty threshold has risen and fallen, but has on average increased by a tenth of a percentage point per year.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis increasing income inequality has many effects on Californians' lives, but one of the easiest to measure is life expectancy. This can be taken as a proxy for health or even general welfare. A study conducted by Clarke et al.[74] related life expectancy to socioeconomic status (SES, an index including income and other related factors), finding that Californians in the top 20% by SES live on average 6 years longer than those in the bottom 20% (81 years, compared to 75). This disparity becomes even more pronounced when intersected with race: White males in the top 20% live 14 years longer than African American males in the bottom 20% (for females, the difference is 10 years). This illustrates the pervasive and severe consequences of socioeconomic inequality in California.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nA program in Oakland illustrates the complex interactions among ethnic groups. The City of Oakland implemented the nation's first policy of recruiting bilingual applicants for public-facing city jobs in 2001 in response to growing Chinese- and Spanish-speaking populations. This increased the employment of Hispanic and Chinese bilinguals throughout the public workforce, but led to a corresponding decrease in Black monolingual employment. Thus a policy intended to remove lingual barriers to city services also had notable impacts on the racial segmentation of public employment, and so on racial differences in income.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\n Media related to Demographics of California at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What percentage of the united states lives in california?"},{"output":"12-megapixel rear camera","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSensors:\\r\\n\\r\\nOther:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+ (shortened to S8 and S8+, respectively) and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active are Android phablet smartphones (with the S8+ being the phablet smartphone) produced by Samsung Electronics as their eighth generation of the Samsung Galaxy S series. The S8 and S8+ were unveiled on 29 March 2017 and directly succeed the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and international rollout throughout April and May. The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017 and is exclusive to certain U.S. cellular carriers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller aspect ratio and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, iris and face recognition, a new suite of virtual assistant features known as Bixby (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), a shift from MicroUSB to USB-C charging, and Samsung DeX, a docking station accessory that allows the phones to be used with a desktop interface with keyboard and mouse input support. The S8 Active features tougher materials designed for protection against shock, shatter, water and dust, with a metal frame and a tough texture for improved grip that makes the S8 Active have a rugged design. The Active's screen measures the same size as the standard S8 model but loses the curved edges in favor of a metal frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera. A video published after the phones' release proved that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 11, 2018, Samsung launched the successor to the S8 flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S9.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to its official announcement, media outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders. In December 2016, SamMobile reported that the Galaxy S8 would not feature a 3.5?mm headphone jack,[10] later reported to be a false rumor.[11] In January 2017, The Guardian reported on bigger screens for both of the two phone sizes, with edge-to-edge \\"infinity\\" displays and very limited bezels, and an iris scanner.[12] Additionally, The Guardian stated that the phones would come with 64?gigabytes of storage and support microSD cards, use USB-C connectors, and feature a \\"Bixby\\" intelligent personal assistant.[12][13][14] Soon after, VentureBeat revealed photos of the phones and additional details, including the lack of physical navigation and home buttons, in which the fingerprint sensor was moved to the back of the phone.[15][16][17] Evan Blass tweeted in mid-March about color options for the phones.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ were officially unveiled on 29 March 2017, with pre-orders beginning 30 March and official U.S. release on 21 April 2017.[20][21] Following Best Buy retail listings in March,[22] Samsung opened pre-orders for unlocked U.S. handsets on 9 May 2017, with availability starting 31 May.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devices have also been released internationally. On 21 April 2017, they were made available in South Korea,[25] Canada,[26] and Taiwan.[27] On 28 April, they were made available in the United Kingdom,[28] Australia,[29] Ireland,[30] and Russia.[31] followed by Singapore one day later.[32] On 5 May, they were made available in Malaysia.[33] New Zealand,[34] India,[35] the Philippines,[36] and Thailand.[37] followed by Brazil on 12 May.[38] On 25 May, they were made available in China,[39] and Hong Kong.[40] On 8 June, they were made available in Japan.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017, pictures of the Galaxy S8 Active were leaked on Reddit,[42][43] and the following month, AT&T \\"accidentally\\" confirmed its existence through a document in a promotional campaign.[44][45] It officially became available for pre-order, exclusively through AT&T, on 8 August 2017, with in-store purchase available 11 August.[46] VentureBeat reported in late September that the device would also become available through T-Mobile in November,[47] and Samsung subsequently confirmed both T-Mobile and Sprint availability in early November.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ both feature 1440p OLED displays, with an 18.5:9 (37:18) aspect ratio taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones; the S8 has a 5.8-inch panel, while the S8+ uses a larger 6.2-inch panel. The displays on both devices curve along the side bezels of the device, with minimal bezels that Samsung markets as an \\"Infinity Display\\", and the display panel itself has rounded edges.[20] They use DCI-P3, offering what screen-testing website DisplayMate describes as the largest native color gamut, highest peak brightness, highest contrast rating in ambient light, highest screen resolution, lowest reflectance, and highest contrast ratio.[49][50] The S8 features an octa-core Exynos 8895 system-on-chip and 4?GB of RAM; models in North American and East Asian markets utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 instead. Both chips are manufactured by Samsung with a 10 nm process.[20][51] They contain 64?GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card.[20] The Galaxy S8 is one of the first smartphones to support Bluetooth 5, supporting new capabilities such as connecting two wireless headphones to the device at once.[52] It is also bundled with Harman AKG earbuds.[53][54] Both smartphones have improved satellite navigation over the predecessors by including Galileo receivers.[5] In the United States, the S8 and S8+ are available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, and Arctic Silver color options, whereas gold and blue are available internationally.[20] The blue option was made available in the U.S. in July 2017.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike past Galaxy S series models, the S8 line does not feature physical navigation keys, electing to use on-screen keys instead.[20] However, unlike other implementations, the home button can still be activated if it is hidden or the screen is off. The S8's display features pressure sensitivity limited to the home button.[57] To prevent the home button from burn-in damage, its position moves slightly.[58][59] While The Verge claims that the S8 uses exactly the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S7, though with software improvements,[20] a report from PhoneArena claims that the phones carry new, custom camera modules.[60] The front-facing camera was upgraded to an 8-megapixel sensor with autofocus.[20][61] The S8 features fingerprint and iris scanners; the fingerprint reader is relocated to the rear of the device, to the left of the camera, due to the removal of the physical home button.[20] In addition to an iris scanner, the S8 also features face-scanning as an option to unlock the phone.[62][63] Face recognition technology had previously been implemented in earlier models since the Galaxy S III.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ use non-removable 3000 and 3500?mAh batteries respectively; Samsung stated that it had engineered the batteries to retain their capacity for a longer period of time than previous models.[61] The S8 supports AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA)[65] and Qi wireless charging standards.[20] Due to the recalls of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Samsung said in a press conference it is committed to stricter quality control and safety testing procedures on all of the company's future products.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSamsung also launched a Galaxy S8+ with 128?GB of storage and 6?GB of RAM exclusively in China and South Korea, and a bundle offer in the countries provides both the exclusive model and the Samsung DeX docking station.[67][68] The unique variant was also released in India in June 2017.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 Active features a rugged design and significantly tougher materials to make it shock, shatter, water, and dust resistant. It has a larger battery than either of the regular S8s, at 4000?mAh. Unlike the previous phones in the Active line, the S8 Active does not have tactile buttons, instead using onscreen keys like the regular variants of the S8. It also no longer has the dedicated action button of previous versions which could be reprogrammed to be a shortcut to favorite apps, with the action button being replaced with the Bixby button. The \\"infinity\\" edge display of the standard models is removed, replaced with a metal frame and bumpers in the corners to protect from shocks, while the back is fitted with a \\"rugged, tough texture for a secure grip\\". Its screen also measures 5.8 inches, the size of the regular S8, and has quad HD Super AMOLED in 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The S8 Active is sold in Meteor Gray, but AT&T also has a Titanium Gold color.[46] The T-Mobile US version of the S8 Active also supports the company's 600 MHz LTE network that was starting to be rolled out at the time the device was announced.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 launched with the Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\" operating system with the proprietary Samsung Experience (formerly TouchWiz) user interface and software suite.[61] The software features a suite of assistant functions known as \\"Bixby\\", which is designed primarily to interact with Samsung's bundled applications and other supported services. The feature allows the use of voice commands to perform phone functions, can generate cards shown on a home screen page (replacing the Flipboard integration formerly featured) based on a user's interactions, and perform searches utilizing object recognition via the camera.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBixby supports third-party integration via an SDK.[61] The S8 supports the use of a docking station known as Samsung DeX to access a PC-like desktop environment on an external display, with support for mouse and keyboard input.[71] On 21 April 2017, coinciding with the phone's official retail date, reports surfaced that the default music player on the Galaxy S8 would be Google Play Music, continuing a trend that started with the S7 in 2016. However, for the S8, Samsung partnered with Google to incorporate additional exclusive features into the app, including the ability to upload up to 100,000 tracks to the service's cloud storage, an increase from the 50,000 tracks users are normally allowed to upload. Additionally, new users get a three-month free trial to the service, the same as given to users who purchase Google's own Pixel smartphone. Furthermore, Google stated that more Samsung-exclusive features will be added to the app in the future, and that the Bixby assistant will also be supported by the app.[72][73] Bixby replaces S Voice, the voice recognition technology previously found in Samsung Galaxy models.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, Google announced that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will support the company's Daydream virtual reality platform after Samsung rolls out a software update scheduled for mid-2017.[75][76] In July 2017, Verizon began rolling out an update for its devices, with support for Daydream.[77][78] The Galaxy S8 was one of the first Android phones to support ARCore, Google's augmented reality engine.[79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2018, the official Android 8.0 Oreo update began rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+, and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the phone's protective case reportedly cracking and peeling away in under 2 months of use, Dan Seifert of The Verge praised the design of the Galaxy S8, describing it as a \\"stunning device to look at and hold\\" that was \\"refined and polished to a literal shine\\", and adding that it \\"truly doesn't look like any other phone you might have used before\\". The hardware of the device was described as \\"practically flawless\\". Seifert also liked the new software, writing that \\"Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness. In a refreshing change of pace, the software on the S8 is, dare I say, good [sic]\\". However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that \\"in its current state, it doesnt do much at all\\", and also criticized the number of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was \\"fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isnt noticeably faster or quicker than a Google Pixel, LG G6, or iPhone 7\\".[82] Fellow Verge reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was \\"a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice\\", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release.[83] The Verge wrote that \\"Samsungs six-month-old S8 has cutting edge features and design with fewer issues than other Android phones\\" like the Google Pixel 2 and LG V30, and that the \\"OLED screen stretches to the edges of the device and curves on its sides in an almost liquid fashion. It makes the S8 look just as fresh today as it did when it debuted\\", and pointing out that the S8's popularity and carrier support guaranteed plenty of third-party accessories.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Velazco of Engadget similarly praised the design, stating that \\"from their rounded edges to their precisely formed metal-and-glass bodies, they feel like smaller, sleeker versions of the Galaxy Note 7\\", and also praised the display as being simply \\"awesome\\". Velazco also praised the software, calling Samsung's added interface \\"subtle and thoughtful in its design choices\\". While noting that the Bixby assistant wasn't ready yet, he did compliment the promised voice features as being more granular than those offered through Siri or Google Assistant, and wrote that \\"With that kind of complexity involved, maybe it's no surprise this stuff isn't done yet\\". Also praising performance and the camera, though noting that \\"The 12-megapixel sensors on the back haven't changed much since last year. That's not a bad thing since they were great cameras to start with\\", Velazco summarized his review by writing that the devices \\"aren't perfect, but they're as close as Samsung has ever gotten\\".[85] Brandon Russell of TechnoBuffalo claimed that the camera could not beat Google's Pixel smartphone.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nRon Amadeo of Ars Technica noted that the device's unusual aspect ratio resulted in pillarboxing when watching 16:9 video without zooming or stretching it. He complimented the feel of the S8, calling it \\"perfected\\", but criticized the glass back for being \\"more fragile\\" and that \\"Glossy, slippery glass doesn't feel as good in your hand as metal does, either. For the top-tier premium price tag, we'd prefer Samsung to put in the extra work and use a metal back\\". He criticized the biometric options for unlocking the phones, writing that \\"There's an iris scanner, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. The problem is none of them are any good\\", and also criticized duplicate apps, writing that \\"most of which can't be removed and aren't very compelling\\". Additionally, he criticized Bixby,  calling it \\"an odd addition\\" due to the phone's Google Assistant functionality already present.[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the phone's official announcement, reports suggested that Bixby would support \\"7-8 languages\\" at launch.[88] Later reports after the phone's announcement clarified that Bixby would only support Korean and American English languages at its release, though noting that more languages would be coming \\"in the following months\\".[89][90] In mid-April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bixby would be launched without support for American English.[91][92] On 19 July 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby had begun rolling out to Galaxy S8 users in the United States.[93][94]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ broke pre-order records in South Korea, with more than 720,000 units booked in one week, a notable increase from the 100,000 units of the Galaxy S7 and 200,000 units of the Note 7.[95][96] By mid-April, the number had increased to one million pre-orders.[97][98] On 24 April 2017, Samsung announced that sales of the Galaxy S8 was its \\"best ever\\". Although it did not release specific sales numbers, it announced that sales of the S8 were 30% higher year-over-year than the Galaxy S7.[99][100] Subsequent reports in May announced that Samsung had sold over five million units.[101][102] Jon Fingas of Engadget wrote that, although Samsung advertised its pre-order records, sales comparisons to other models on the market were difficult due to unannounced sales figures.[103] However, a report from AppleInsider took a comparison look at previous Galaxy S models' first-month sales, writing that the Galaxy S7 saw 7-9 million units shipped in its first month, and the Galaxy S4 sold 10 million. The publication further wrote that \\"Each year since reaching Peak Galaxy in 2014, Samsung has floated the idea that its new model has outpaced sales, shipments (or sometimes \\"preorders\\") of the previous edition, but in reality Galaxy S salesand subsequently Samsung Mobile profitshave actually never recovered since the Galaxy S4\\".[104]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the official release, it was reported that some Galaxy S8 displays had a bad white balance, causing them to exhibit a reddish tint.[105] Samsung stated that the Galaxy S8 was \\"built with an adaptive display that optimizes the colour range, saturation, and sharpness depending on the environment\\", but noted that the device's operating system provides settings for manually adjusting the display's appearance and white balance.[105][106][107] On 21 April, Samsung stated that the red tinting was purely a software issue, and would be patched in a future update.[108] The Investor reported that Samsung would replace the affected devices if a software update did not fix the issue.[109] Updates in various regions started rolling out in early May, fixing the issue.[110][111][112]\\r\\n\\r\\nReports surfaced at the end of April that some Galaxy S8 devices were \\"restarting by themselves\\". Samsung has not yet commented on the issue.[113][114]\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the phone's unveiling, bloggers produced a video showing that the Galaxy S8's facial recognition scanner could be tricked to unlock the phone by showing it a photo of the user.[115][116] In a statement to Business Insider, a Samsung spokesperson stated that \\"Facial recognition is a convenient action to open your phone ÿ similar to the 'swipe to unlock' action. We offer the highest level of biometric authentication ÿ fingerprint and iris ÿ to lock your phone and authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure Folder\\".[117]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, researchers from the Chaos Computer Club posted a video showing that the S8's iris recognition system can be fooled with a contact lens and a suitable photograph of an eye.[118] Samsung told BBC News that it was \\"aware of the issue\\", and stated that \\"If there is a potential vulnerability or the advent of a new method that challenges our efforts to ensure security at any time, we will respond as quickly as possible to resolve the issue\\".[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2017, Galaxy S8 users reported on Reddit that they were unable to receive SMS messages, with no fix available and without any comment from Samsung.[120]","input":"How many megapixels does a samsung galaxy s8 have?"},{"output":"September 14, 1814","context":"\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is the national anthem of the United States. The lyrics come from \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\",[2] a poem written on September 14, 1814, by the then 35-year-old lawyer and amateur poet Francis Scott Key after witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry by British ships of the Royal Navy in Baltimore Harbor during the Battle of Baltimore in the War of 1812. Key was inspired by the large U.S. flag, with 15 stars and 15 stripes, known as the Star-Spangled Banner, flying triumphantly above the fort during the U.S. victory.\\r\\nThe poem was set to the tune of a popular British song written by John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a men's social club in London. \\"To Anacreon in Heaven\\" (or \\"The Anacreontic Song\\"), with various lyrics, was already popular in the United States. Set to Key's poem and renamed \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", it soon became a well-known U.S. patriotic song. With a range of 19 semitones, it is known for being very difficult to sing. Although the poem has four stanzas, only the first is commonly sung today.\\r\\n\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" was recognized for official use by the United States Navy in 1889, and by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, and was made the national anthem by a congressional resolution on March 3, 1931 (46 Stat. 1508, codified at 36 U.S.C.??301), which was signed by President Herbert Hoover.\\r\\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of U.S. officialdom. \\"Hail, Columbia\\" served this purpose at official functions for most of the 19th century. \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\", whose melody is identical to \\"God Save the Queen\\", the United Kingdom's national anthem,[3] also served as a de facto national anthem.[4] Following the War of 1812 and subsequent U.S. wars, other songs emerged to compete for popularity at public events, among them \\"America the Beautiful\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 3, 1814, following the Burning of Washington and the Raid on Alexandria, Francis Scott Key and John Stuart Skinner set sail from Baltimore aboard the ship HMS Minden, flying a flag of truce on a mission approved by President James Madison. Their objective was to secure an exchange of prisoners, one of whom was Dr. William Beanes, the elderly and popular town physician of Upper Marlboro and a friend of Key's who had been captured in his home. Beanes was accused of aiding the arrest of British soldiers. Key and Skinner boarded the British flagship HMS Tonnant on September 7 and spoke with Major General Robert Ross and Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane over dinner while the two officers discussed war plans. At first, Ross and Cochrane refused to release Beanes but relented after Key and Skinner showed them letters written by wounded British prisoners praising Beanes and other Americans for their kind treatment.\\r\\nBecause Key and Skinner had heard details of the plans for the attack on Baltimore, they were held captive until after the battle, first aboard HMS Surprise and later back on HMS Minden. After the bombardment, certain British gunboats attempted to slip past the fort and effect a landing in a cove to the west of it, but they were turned away by fire from nearby Fort Covington, the city's last line of defense.\\r\\nDuring the rainy night, Key had witnessed the bombardment and observed that the fort's smaller \\"storm flag\\" continued to fly, but once the shell and Congreve rocket[5] barrage had stopped, he would not know how the battle had turned out until dawn. On the morning of September 14, the storm flag had been lowered and the larger flag had been raised.\\r\\nDuring the bombardment, HMS Terror and HMS Meteor provided some of the \\"bombs bursting in air\\".\\r\\nKey was inspired by the U.S. victory and the sight of the large U.S. flag flying triumphantly above the fort. This flag, with fifteen stars and fifteen stripes, had been made by Mary Young Pickersgill together with other workers in her home on Baltimore's Pratt Street. The flag later came to be known as the Star-Spangled Banner and is today on display in the National Museum of American History, a treasure of the Smithsonian Institution. It was restored in 1914 by Amelia Fowler, and again in 1998 as part of an ongoing conservation program.\\r\\nAboard the ship the next day, Key wrote a poem on the back of a letter he had kept in his pocket. At twilight on September 16, he and Skinner were released in Baltimore. He completed the poem at the Indian Queen Hotel, where he was staying, and titled it \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\". It was first published nationally in The Analectic Magazine.[6][7]\\r\\nMuch of the idea of the poem, including the flag imagery and some of the wording, is derived from an earlier song by Key, also set to the tune of \\"The Anacreontic Song\\". The song, known as \\"When the Warrior Returns\\",[8] was written in honor of Stephen Decatur and Charles Stewart on their return from the First Barbary War.  Absent elaboration by Francis Scott Key prior to his death in 1843, some have speculated in modern times about the meaning of phrases or verses. According to British historian Robin Blackburn, the words \\"the hireling and slave\\" allude to the thousands of ex-slaves in the British ranks organised as the Corps of Colonial Marines, who had been liberated by the British and demanded to be placed in the battle line \\"where they might expect to meet their former masters.\\"[9] Nevertheless, Professor Mark Clague, a professor of musicology at the University of Michigan, argues that the \\"middle two verses of Key's lyric vilify the British enemy in the War of 1812\\" and \\"in no way glorifies or celebrates slavery.\\"[10] Clague writes that \\"For Key ... the British mercenaries were scoundrels and the Colonial Marines were traitors who threatened to spark a national insurrection.\\"[10] This harshly anti-British nature of Verse 3 led to its omission in sheet music in World War I, when the British and the U.S. were allies.[10] Responding to the assertion of writer Jon Schwarz of The Intercept that the song is a \\"celebration of slavery,\\"[11] Clague said that: \\"The reference to slaves is about the use and in some sense the manipulation, of black Americans to fight for the British, with the promise of freedom. The American forces included African-Americans as well as whites. The term 'freemen,' whose heroism is celebrated in the fourth stanza, would have encompassed both.\\"[12]\\r\\nOthers suggest that \\"Key may have intended the phrase as a reference to the British Navy's practice of impressment (kidnapping sailors and forcing them to fight in defense of the crown), or as a semi-metaphorical slap at the British invading force as a whole (which included a large number of mercenaries).\\"[13]\\r\\nKey gave the poem to his brother-in-law Judge Joseph H. Nicholson who saw that the words fit the popular melody \\"The Anacreontic Song\\", by English composer John Stafford Smith. This was the official song of the Anacreontic Society, an 18th-century gentlemen's club of amateur musicians in London. Nicholson took the poem to a printer in Baltimore, who anonymously made the first known broadside printing on September 17; of these, two known copies survive.\\r\\nOn September 20, both the Baltimore Patriot and The American printed the song, with the note \\"Tune: Anacreon in Heaven\\". The song quickly became popular, with seventeen newspapers from Georgia to New Hampshire printing it. Soon after, Thomas Carr of the Carr Music Store in Baltimore published the words and music together under the title \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", although it was originally called \\"Defence of Fort M'Henry\\". Thomas Carr's arrangement introduced the raised fourth which became the standard deviation from \\"The Anacreontic Song\\".[14] The song's popularity increased and its first public performance took place in October when Baltimore actor Ferdinand Durang sang it at Captain McCauley's tavern. Washington Irving, then editor of the Analectic Magazine in Philadelphia, reprinted the song in November 1814.\\r\\nBy the early 20th century, there were various versions of the song in popular use. Seeking a singular, standard version, President Woodrow Wilson tasked the U.S. Bureau of Education with providing that official version. In response, the Bureau enlisted the help of five musicians to agree upon an arrangement. Those musicians were Walter Damrosch, Will Earhart, Arnold J. Gantvoort, Oscar Sonneck and John Philip Sousa. The standardized version that was voted upon by these five musicians premiered at Carnegie Hall on December 5, 1917, in a program that included Edward Elgar's Carillon and Gabriel Piern's The Children's Crusade. The concert was put on by the Oratorio Society of New York and conducted by Walter Damrosch.[15] An official handwritten version of the final votes of these five men has been found and shows all five men's votes tallied, measure by measure.[16]\\r\\nThe song gained popularity throughout the 19th century and bands played it during public events, such as July 4th celebrations.\\r\\nA plaque displayed at Fort Meade, South Dakota, claims that the idea of making \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" the national anthem began on their parade ground in 1892. Colonel Caleb Carlton, Post Commander, established the tradition that the song be played \\"at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts.\\" Carlton explained the custom to Governor Sheldon of South Dakota who \\"promised me that he would try to have the custom established among the state militia.\\" Carlton wrote that after a similar discussion, Secretary of War, Daniel E. Lamont issued an order that it \\"be played at every Army post every evening at retreat.\\"[17]\\r\\nIn 1899, the U.S. Navy officially adopted \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\".[18] In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" be played at military[18] and other appropriate occasions. The playing of the song two years later during the seventh-inning stretch of Game One of the 1918 World Series, and thereafter during each game of the series is often cited as the first instance that the anthem was played at a baseball game,[19] though evidence shows that the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" was performed as early as 1897 at opening day ceremonies in Philadelphia and then more regularly at the Polo Grounds in New York City beginning in 1898. In any case, the tradition of performing the national anthem before every baseball game began in World War II.[20]\\r\\nOn April 10, 1918, John Charles Linthicum, U.S. Congressman from Maryland, introduced a bill to officially recognize \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem.[21] The bill did not pass.[21] On April 15, 1929, Linthicum introduced the bill again, his sixth time doing so.[21] On November 3, 1929, Robert Ripley drew a panel in his syndicated cartoon, Ripley's Believe it or Not!, saying \\"Believe It or Not, America has no national anthem\\".[22]\\r\\nIn 1930, Veterans of Foreign Wars started a petition for the United States to officially recognize \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem.[23] Five million people signed the petition.[23] The petition was presented to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary on January 31, 1930.[24] On the same day, Elsie Jorss-Reilley and Grace Evelyn Boudlin sang the song to the Committee to refute the perception that it was too high pitched for a typical person to sing.[25] The Committee voted in favor of sending the bill to the House floor for a vote.[26] The House of Representatives passed the bill later that year.[27] The Senate passed the bill on March 3, 1931.[27] President Herbert Hoover signed the bill on March 4, 1931, officially adopting \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" as the national anthem of the United States of America.[1] As currently codified, the United States Code states that \\"[t]he composition consisting of the words and music known as the Star-Spangled Banner is the national anthem.\\"[28]\\r\\nThe song is notoriously difficult for nonprofessionals to sing because of its wide range?ÿ a 12th. Humorist Richard Armour referred to the song's difficulty in his book It All Started With Columbus.\\r\\nIn an attempt to take Baltimore, the British attacked Fort McHenry, which protected the harbor. Bombs were soon bursting in air, rockets were glaring, and all in all it was a moment of great historical interest. During the bombardment, a young lawyer named Francis Off Key [sic] wrote \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", and when, by the dawn's early light, the British heard it sung, they fled in terror.\\r\\nProfessional and amateur singers have been known to forget the words, which is one reason the song is sometimes pre-recorded and lip-synced.[citation needed] Other times the issue is avoided by having the performer(s) play the anthem instrumentally instead of singing it. The pre-recording of the anthem has become standard practice at some ballparks, such as Boston's Fenway Park, according to the SABR publication The Fenway Project.[29]\\r\\n\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" is traditionally played at the beginning of public sports events and orchestral concerts in the United States, as well as other public gatherings. The National Hockey League and Major League Soccer both require venues in both the U.S. and Canada to perform both the Canadian and U.S. national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (with the \\"away\\" anthem being performed first).[30][better?source?needed] It is also usual for both U.S. and Canadian anthems (done in the same way as the NHL and MLS) to be played at Major League Baseball and National Basketball Association games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the Toronto Raptors (respectively), the only Canadian teams in those two major U.S. sports leagues, and in All Star Games on the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The Buffalo Sabres of the NHL, which play in a city on the CanadaÿUS border and have a substantial Canadian fan base, play both anthems before all home games regardless of where the visiting team is based.[31]\\r\\nTwo especially unusual performances of the song took place in the immediate aftermath of the United States September 11 attacks. On September 12, 2001, the Queen broke with tradition and allowed the Band of the Coldstream Guards to perform the anthem at Buckingham Palace, London, at the ceremonial Changing of the Guard, as a gesture of support for Britain's ally.[32] The following day at a St. Paul's Cathedral memorial service, the Queen joined in the singing of the anthem, an unprecedented occurrence.[33]\\r\\nThe 200th anniversary of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" occurred in 2014 with various special events occurring throughout the United States. A particularly significant celebration occurred during the week of September 10ÿ16 in and around Baltimore, Maryland. Highlights included playing of a new arrangement of the anthem arranged by John Williams and participation of President Obama on Defender's Day, September 12, 2014, at Fort McHenry.[34] In addition, the anthem bicentennial included a youth music celebration[35] including the presentation of the National Anthem Bicentennial Youth Challenge winning composition written by Noah Altshuler.\\r\\nThe first popular music performance of the anthem heard by the mainstream U.S. was by Puerto Rican singer and guitarist Jos Feliciano. He created a nationwide uproar when he strummed a slow, blues-style rendition of the song[36] at Tiger Stadium in Detroit before game five of the 1968 World Series, between Detroit and St. Louis.[37] This rendition started contemporary \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" controversies. The response from many in the Vietnam War-era U.S. was generally negative. Despite the controversy, Feliciano's performance opened the door for the countless interpretations of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" heard in the years since.[38] One week after Feliciano's performance, the anthem was in the news again when U.S. athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted controversial raised fists at the 1968 Olympics while the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" played at a medal ceremony.\\r\\nMarvin Gaye gave a soul-influenced performance at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game and Whitney Houston gave a soulful rendition before Super Bowl XXV in 1991, which was released as a single that charted at number 20 in 1991 and number 6 in 2001 (along with Jos Feliciano, the only times the national anthem has been on the Billboard Hot 100). In 1993, Kiss did an instrumental rock version as the closing track on their album, Alive III. Another famous instrumental interpretation is Jimi Hendrix's version, which was a set-list staple from autumn 1968 until his death in September 1970, including a famous rendition at the Woodstock music festival in 1969. Incorporating sonic effects to emphasize the \\"rockets' red glare\\", and \\"bombs bursting in air\\", it became a late-1960s emblem. Roseanne Barr gave a controversial performance of the anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game at Jack Murphy Stadium on July 25, 1990. The comedian belted out a screechy rendition of the song, and afterward, she attempted a gesture of ballplayers by spitting and grabbing her crotch as if adjusting a protective cup. The performance offended some, including the sitting U.S. President, George H. W. Bush.[39] Sufjan Stevens has frequently performed the \\"Star-Spangled Banner\\" in live sets, replacing the optimism in the end of the first verse with a new coda that alludes to the divisive state of the nation today. David Lee Roth both referenced parts of the anthem and played part of a hard rock rendition of the anthem on his song, \\"Yankee Rose\\" on his 1986 solo album, Eat 'Em and Smile. Steven Tyler also caused some controversy in 2001 (at the Indianapolis 500, to which he later issued a public apology) and again in 2012 (at the AFC Championship Game) with a cappella renditions of the song with changed lyrics.[40] A version of Aerosmith's Joe Perry and Brad Whitford playing part of the song can be heard at the end of their version of \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" on the Rockin' the Joint album. The band Boston gave an instrumental rock rendition of the anthem on their Greatest Hits album. The band Crush 40 made a version of the song as opening track from the album Thrill of the Feel (2000).\\r\\nIn March 2005, a government-sponsored program, the National Anthem Project, was launched after a Harris Interactive poll showed many adults knew neither the lyrics nor the history of the anthem.[41]\\r\\nO say can you see, by the dawn's early light,\\r\\nWhat so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming,\\r\\nWhose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,\\r\\nO'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?\\r\\nAnd the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air,\\r\\nGave proof through the night that our flag was still there;\\r\\nO say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,\\r\\nWhere the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,\\r\\nWhat is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,\\r\\nAs it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?\\r\\nNow it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,\\r\\nIn full glory reflected now shines in the stream:\\r\\n'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd where is that band who so vauntingly swore\\r\\nThat the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,\\r\\nA home and a country, should leave us no more?\\r\\nTheir blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.\\r\\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\\r\\nFrom the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:\\r\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nO thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand\\r\\nBetween their loved homes and the war's desolation.\\r\\nBlest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land\\r\\nPraise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!\\r\\nThen conquer we must, when our cause it is just,\\r\\nAnd this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'\\r\\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave\\r\\nO'er the land of the free and the home of the brave![42]\\r\\nIn indignation over the start of the American Civil War, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.[43] added a fifth stanza to the song in 1861, which appeared in songbooks of the era.[44]\\r\\nWhen our land is illumined with Liberty's smile,\\r\\nIf a foe from within strike a blow at her glory,\\r\\nDown, down with the traitor that dares to defile\\r\\nThe flag of her stars and the page of her story!\\r\\nBy the millions unchained who our birthright have gained,\\r\\nWe will keep her bright blazon forever unstained!\\r\\nAnd the Star-Spangled Banner in triumph shall wave\\r\\nWhile the land of the free is the home of the brave.\\r\\nIn a version hand-written by Francis Scott Key in 1840, the third line reads \\"Whose bright stars and broad stripes, through the clouds of the fight\\".[45]\\r\\nSeveral films have their titles taken from the song's lyrics. These include two films titled Dawn's Early Light (2000[46] and 2005);[47] two made-for-TV features titled By Dawn's Early Light (1990[48] and 2000);[49] two films titled So Proudly We Hail (1943[50] and 1990);[51] a feature film (1977)[52] and a short (2005)[53] titled Twilight's Last Gleaming; and four films titled Home of the Brave (1949,[54] 1986,[55] 2004,[56] and 2006).[57] A 1936 short titled \\"The Song of a Nation\\" from Warner Brothers shows a version of the origin of the song.[58]\\r\\nWhen the U.S. national anthem was first recognized by law in 1931, there was no prescription as to behavior during its playing. On June 22, 1942, the law was revised indicating that those in uniform should salute during its playing, while others should simply stand at attention, men removing their hats. The same code also required that women should place their hands over their hearts when the flag is displayed during the playing of the national anthem, but not if the flag was not present. On December 23, 1942, the law was again revised instructing men and women to stand at attention and face in the direction of the music when it was played. That revision also directed men and women to place their hands over their hearts only if the flag was displayed. Those in uniform were required to salute. On July 7, 1976, the law was simplified. Men and women were instructed to stand with their hands over their hearts, men removing their hats, irrespective of whether or not the flag was displayed and those in uniform saluting. On August 12, 1998, the law was rewritten keeping the same instructions, but differentiating between \\"those in uniform\\" and \\"members of the Armed Forces and veterans\\" who were both instructed to salute during the playing whether or not the flag was displayed. Because of the changes in law over the years and confusion between instructions for the Pledge of Allegiance versus the National Anthem, throughout most of the 20th century many people simply stood at attention or with their hands folded in front of them during the playing of the Anthem, and when reciting the Pledge they would hold their hand (or hat) over their heart. After 9/11, the custom of placing the hand over the heart during the playing of the national anthem became nearly universal.[59][60][61]\\r\\nSince 1998, federal law (viz., the United States Code 36 U.S.C.??301) states that during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all present including those in uniform should stand at attention; Non-military service individuals should face the flag with the right hand over the heart; Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are present and not in uniform may render the military salute; military service persons not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold the headdress at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart; and Members of the Armed Forces and veterans who are in uniform should give the military salute at the first note of the anthem and maintain that position until the last note. The law further provides that when the flag is not displayed, all present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed. Military law requires all vehicles on the installation to stop when the song is played and all individuals outside to stand at attention and face the direction of the music and either salute, in uniform, or place the right hand over the heart, if out of uniform. The law was amended in 2008, and since allows military veterans to salute out of uniform, as well.[62][63]\\r\\nThe text of 36 U.S.C.??301 is suggestive and not regulatory in nature. Failure to follow the suggestions is not a violation of the law. This behavioral requirement for the national anthem is subject to the same First Amendment controversies that surround the Pledge of Allegiance.[64] For example, Jehovah's Witnesses do not sing the national anthem, though they are taught that standing is an \\"ethical decision\\" that individual believers must make based on their \\"conscience.\\"[65][66][67]\\r\\nThe 1968 Olympics Black Power salute was a political demonstration conducted by African-American athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos during their medal ceremony at the 1968 Summer Olympics in the Olympic Stadium in Mexico City. After having won gold and bronze medals respectively in the 200-meter running event, they turned on the podium to face their flags, and to hear the American national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". Each athlete raised a black-gloved fist, and kept them raised until the anthem had finished. In addition, Smith, Carlos, and Australian silver medalist Peter Norman all wore human rights badges on their jackets. In his autobiography, Silent Gesture, Smith stated that the gesture was not a \\"Black Power\\" salute, but a \\"human rights salute\\". The event is regarded as one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games.[68]\\r\\nPolitically motivated protests of the national anthem began in the National Football League (NFL) after San Francisco 49ers quarterback (QB) Colin Kaepernick sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, in response to police brutality in America, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. Kaepernick also sat during the first two preseason games, but he went unnoticed.[69]\\r\\nIn November 2017, the California Chapter of the NAACP called on Congress to remove The Star-Spangled Banner as the national anthem. Alice Huffman, California NAACP president said: \\"it's racist; it doesn't represent our community, it's anti-black.\\"[70] The third stanza of the anthem, which is rarely sung and few know, contains the words, \\"No refuge could save the hireling and slave, From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:\\", which some interpret as racist. The organization was still seeking a representative to sponsor the legislation in Congress at the time of their announcement.\\r\\nAs a result of immigration to the United States and the incorporation of non-English speaking people into the country, the lyrics of the song have been translated into other languages. In 1861, it was translated into German.[71] The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919.[72] It has since been translated into Hebrew[73] and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants,[74] Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006),[75] French by Acadians of Louisiana,[76] Samoan,[77] and Irish.[78] The third verse of the anthem has also been translated into Latin.[79]\\r\\nWith regard to the indigenous languages of North America, there are versions in Navajo[80][81][82] and Cherokee.[83]","input":"When did francis scott key write the lyrics that became the national anthem?"},{"output":"G. E. Moore","context":"Analytic philosophy (sometimes analytical philosophy) is a style of philosophy that became dominant in the Western world at the beginning of the 20th century. The term can refer to one of several things:\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a characteristic paragraph by Russell:\\r\\n\\r\\nModern analytical empiricism [...] differs from that of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume by its incorporation of mathematics and its development of a powerful logical technique. It is thus able, in regard to certain problems, to achieve definite answers, which have the quality of science rather than of philosophy. It has the advantage, in comparison with the philosophies of the system-builders, of being able to tackle its problems one at a time, instead of having to invent at one stroke a block theory of the whole universe. Its methods, in this respect, resemble those of science.[12]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia, the majority of university philosophy departments today identify themselves as \\"analytic\\" departments.[13] Analytic philosophy is often understood in contrast to other philosophical traditions, most notably continental philosophies such as existentialism and phenomenology, and also Thomism and Marxism.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish idealism, as taught by philosophers such as F. H. Bradley (1846ÿ1924) and Thomas Hill Green (1836ÿ1882), dominated English philosophy in the late 19th century. With reference to this intellectual basis the initiators of analytic philosophy, G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, articulated early analytic philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince its beginning, a basic goal of analytic philosophy has been conceptual clarity,[15] in the name of which Moore and Russell rejected Hegelianism for being obscure  see for example Moore's \\"A Defence of Common Sense\\" and Russell's critique of the doctrine of internal relations.[16] Inspired by developments in modern logic, the early Russell claimed that the problems of philosophy can be solved by showing the simple constituents of complex notions.[15] An important aspect of British idealism was logical holism  the opinion that there are aspects of the world that can be known only by knowing the whole world. This is closely related to the opinion that relations between items are internal relations, that is, properties of the nature of those items. Russell, along with Wittgenstein, in response promulgated logical atomism and the doctrine of external relations  the belief that the world consists of independent facts.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nRussell, during his early career, along with his collaborator Alfred North Whitehead, was much influenced by Gottlob Frege (1848ÿ1925), who developed predicate logic, which allowed a much greater range of sentences to be parsed into logical form than was possible using the ancient Aristotelian logic. Frege was also influential as a philosopher of mathematics in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. In contrast to Edmund Husserl's 1891 book Philosophie der Arithmetik, which argued that the concept of the cardinal number derived from psychical acts of grouping objects and counting them,[18] Frege argued that mathematics and logic have their own validity, independent of the judgments or mental states of individual mathematicians and logicians (which were the basis of arithmetic according to the \\"psychologism\\" of Husserl's Philosophie). Frege further developed his philosophy of logic and mathematics in The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) and The Basic Laws of Arithmetic (German: Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, 1893ÿ1903), where he provided an alternative to psychologistic accounts of the concept of number.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Frege, Russell argued that mathematics is reducible to logical fundamentals in The Principles of Mathematics (1903). Later, his book written with Whitehead, Principia Mathematica (1910ÿ1913), encouraged many philosophers to renew their interest in the development of symbolic logic. Additionally, Russell adopted Frege's predicate logic as his primary philosophical method, a method Russell thought could expose the underlying structure of philosophical problems. For example, the English word \\"is\\" has three distinct meanings which predicate logic can express as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nRussell sought to resolve various philosophical problems by applying such logical distinctions, most famously in his analysis of definite descriptions in \\"On Denoting\\" (1905).[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom about 1910 to 1930, analytic philosophers like Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein emphasized creating an ideal language for philosophical analysis, which would be free from the ambiguities of ordinary language that, in their opinion, often made philosophy invalid. This philosophical trend can be termed \\"ideal-language analysis\\" or \\"formalism\\". During this phase, Russell and Wittgenstein sought to understand language (and hence philosophical problems) by using formal logic to formalize the way in which philosophical statements are made. Wittgenstein developed a comprehensive system of logical atomism in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (German: Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung, 1921). He thereby argued that the universe is the totality of actual states of affairs and that these states of affairs can be expressed by the language of first-order predicate logic. Thus a picture of the universe can be construed by means of expressing atomic facts in the form of atomic propositions, and linking them using logical operators.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 1920s, to 1940s, a group of philosophers of the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle developed Russell and Wittgenstein's formalism into a doctrine known as \\"logical positivism\\" (or logical empiricism). Logical positivism used formal logical methods to develop an empiricist account of knowledge.[20] Philosophers such as Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach, along with other members of the Vienna Circle, claimed that the truths of logic and mathematics were tautologies, and those of science were verifiable empirical claims. These two constituted the entire universe of meaningful judgments; anything else was nonsense. The claims of ethics, aesthetics and theology were consequently reduced to pseudo-statements, neither empirically true nor false, and therefore meaningless. In reaction to what he considered excesses of logical positivism, Karl Popper's insisted on the role of falsification in the philosophy of sciencealthough his general method was also part of the analytic tradition.[21] With the coming to power of Adolf Hitler and Nazism in 1933, many members of the Vienna and Berlin Circles fled to Britain and America, which helped to reinforce the dominance of logical positivism and analytic philosophy in Anglophone countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nLogical positivists typically considered philosophy as having a very limited function. For them, philosophy concerned the clarification of thoughts, rather than having a distinct subject matter of its own. The positivists adopted the verification principle, according to which every meaningful statement is either analytic or is capable of being verified by experience. This caused the logical positivists to reject many traditional problems of philosophy, especially those of metaphysics or ontology, as meaningless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II, during the late 1940s and 1950s, analytic philosophy became involved with ordinary-language analysis. This resulted in two main trends. One continued Wittgenstein's later philosophy, which differed dramatically from his early work of the Tractatus. The other, known as \\"Oxford philosophy\\", involved J. L. Austin. In contrast to earlier analytic philosophers (including the early Wittgenstein) who thought philosophers should avoid the deceptive trappings of natural language by constructing ideal languages, ordinary-language philosophers claimed that ordinary language already represents many subtle distinctions not recognized in the formulation of traditional philosophical theories or problems. While schools such as logical positivism emphasize logical terms, supposed to be universal and separate from contingent factors (such as culture, language, historical conditions), ordinary-language philosophy emphasizes the use of language by ordinary people. The most prominent ordinary-language philosophers during the 1950s were Austin and Gilbert Ryle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdinary-language philosophers often sought to dissolve philosophical problems by showing them to be the result of misunderstanding ordinary language. Examples include Ryle, who tried to dispose of \\"Descartes' myth\\", and Wittgenstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough contemporary philosophers who self-identify as \\"analytic\\" have widely divergent interests, assumptions, and methodsand have often rejected the fundamental premises that defined analytic philosophy before 1960analytic philosophy today is usually considered to be defined by a particular style,[3] characterized by precision and thoroughness about a specific topic, and resistance to \\"imprecise or cavalier discussions of broad topics\\".[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, logical positivism was challenged influentially by Wittgenstein in the Philosophical Investigations, Quine in \\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\\", and Sellars in Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind. After 1960, Anglophone philosophy began to incorporate a wider range of interests, opinions, and methods.[22] Still, many philosophers in Britain and America still consider themselves \\"analytic philosophers\\".[13][3] They have done so largely by expanding the notion of \\"analytic philosophy\\" from the specific programs that dominated Anglophone philosophy before 1960 to a much more general notion of an \\"analytic\\" style.[22] This interpretation of the history is far from universally accepted, and its opponents[who?] would say that it grossly downplays the role of Wittgenstein during the 1960s and 1970s.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany philosophers and historians have attempted to define or describe analytic philosophy. Those definitions often include an emphasis on conceptual analysis: A.P. Martinich draws an analogy between analytic philosophy's interest in conceptual analysis and analytic chemistry, which aims to determine chemical compositions.[23] Steven D. Hales described analytic philosophy as one of three types of philosophical method practiced in the West: \\"[i]n roughly reverse order by number of proponents, they are phenomenology, ideological philosophy, and analytic philosophy\\".[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nScott Soames agrees that clarity is important: analytic philosophy, he says, has \\"an implicit commitmentalbeit faltering and imperfectto the ideals of clarity, rigor and argumentation\\" and it \\"aims at truth and knowledge, as opposed to moral or spiritual improvement [...] the goal in analytic philosophy is to discover what is true, not to provide a useful recipe for living one's life\\". Soames also states that analytic philosophy is characterised by \\"a more piecemeal approach. There is, I think, a widespread presumption within the tradition that it is often possible to make philosophical progress by intensively investigating a small, circumscribed range of philosophical issues while holding broader, systematic questions in abeyance\\".[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nA few of the most important and active topics and subtopics of analytic philosophy are summarized by the following sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nMotivated by the logical positivists' interest in verificationism, logical behaviorism was the most prominent theory of mind of analytic philosophy for the first half of the 20th century.[26] Behaviorists tended to opine either that statements about the mind were equivalent to statements about behavior and dispositions to behave in particular ways or that mental states were directly equivalent to behavior and dispositions to behave. Behaviorism later became much less popular, in favor of type physicalism or functionalism, theories that identified mental states with brain states. During this period, topics of the philosophy of mind were often related strongly to topics of cognitive science such as modularity or innateness. Finally, analytic philosophy has featured a certain number of philosophers who were dualists, and recently forms of property dualism have had a resurgence; the most prominent representative  is David Chalmers.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Searle suggests that the obsession with the philosophy of language during the 20th century has been superseded by an emphasis on the philosophy of mind,[28] in which functionalism is currently the dominant theory. In recent years, a central focus of research in the philosophy of mind has been consciousness. While there is a general consensus for the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,[29] there are many opinions as to the specifics. The best known theories are Daniel Dennett's heterophenomenology, Fred Dretske and Michael Tye's representationalism, and the higher-order theories of either David M. Rosenthalwho advocates a higher-order thought (HOT) model- or David Armstrong and William Lycanwho advocate a higher-order perception (HOP) model. An alternative higher-order theory, the higher-order global states (HOGS) model, is offered by Robert van Gulick.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophers working with the analytic tradition have gradually come to distinguish three major types of moral philosophy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first half of the 20th century was marked by skepticism toward, and neglect of, normative ethics. Related subjects, such as social and political philosophy, aesthetics, and philosophy of history, became only marginal topics of English-language philosophy during this period.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this time, utilitarianism was the only non-skeptical type of ethics to remain popular. However, as the influence of logical positivism began to decrease mid-century, analytic philosophers had renewed interest in ethics. G. E. M. Anscombe's 1958 \\"Modern Moral Philosophy\\" sparked a revival of Aristotle's virtue ethical approach and John Rawls's 1971 A Theory of Justice restored interest in Kantian ethical philosophy. Today, contemporary normative ethics is dominated by three schools: utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and deontology.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwentieth-century meta-ethics has two origins. The first is G. E. Moore's investigation into the nature of ethical terms (e.g., good) in his Principia Ethica (1903), which identified the naturalistic fallacy. Along with Hume's famous is/ought distinction, the naturalistic fallacy was a major topic of investigation for analytical philosophers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second is in logical positivism and its attitude that statements which are unverifiable are meaningless. Although that attitude was adopted originally to promote scientific investigation by rejecting grand metaphysical systems, it had the side effect of making (ethical and aesthetic) value judgments (as well as religious statements and beliefs) meaningless. But because value judgments are of major importance in human life, it became incumbent on logical positivism to develop an explanation of the nature and meaning of value judgements. As a result, analytic philosophers avoided normative ethics, and instead began meta-ethical investigations into the nature of moral terms, statements, and judgments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logical positivists opined that statements about value- including all ethical and aesthetic judgments- are non-cognitive; that is, they cannot be objectively verified or falsified. Instead, the logical positivists adopted an emotivist theory, which was that value judgments expressed the attitude of the speaker. For example, in this view, saying, \\"Killing is wrong\\", is equivalent to saying, \\"Boo to murder\\", or saying the word \\"murder\\" with a particular tone of disapproval.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile non-cognitivism was generally accepted by analytic philosophers, emotivism had many deficiencies, and evolved into more sophisticated non-cognitivist theories such as the expressivism of Charles Stevenson, and the universal prescriptivism of R. M. Hare, which was based on J. L. Austin's philosophy of speech acts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese theories were not without their critics. Philippa Foot contributed several essays attacking all these theories. J. O. Urmson's article \\"On Grading\\" called the is/ought distinction into question.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs non-cognitivism, the is/ought distinction, and the naturalistic fallacy began to be called into question, analytic philosophers showed a renewed interest in the traditional questions of moral philosophy. Perhaps the most influential being Elizabeth Anscombe, whose monograph Intention was called by Donald Davidson \\"the most important treatment of action since Aristotle\\".[citation needed] A favorite student and friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein, her 1958 article \\"Modern Moral Philosophy\\" introduced the term \\"consequentialism\\" into the philosophical lexicon, declared the \\"is-ought\\" impasse to be unproductive, and resulted in a revival of virtue ethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nA significant feature of analytic philosophy since approximately 1970 has been the emergence of applied ethics- an interest in the application of moral principles to specific practical issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopics of special interest for applied ethics include environmental issues, animal rights, and the many challenges created by advancing medical science.[31][32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Analytic Philosophy of Religion, Harris noted that\\r\\n\\r\\nanalytic philosophy has been a very heterogeneous 'movement'.... some forms of analytic philosophy have proven very sympathetic to the philosophy of religion and have actually provided a philosophical mechanism for responding to other more radical and hostile forms of analytic philosophy.[34]:3\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the study of ethics, early analytic philosophy tended to avoid the study of philosophy of religion, largely dismissing (as per the logical positivists) the subject as part of metaphysics and therefore meaningless.[35] The demise of logical positivism renewed interest in philosophy of religion, prompting philosophers like William Alston, John Mackie, Alvin Plantinga, Robert Merrihew Adams, Richard Swinburne, and Antony Flew not only to introduce new problems, but to re-study classical topics such as the nature of miracles, theistic arguments, the problem of evil, (see existence of God) the rationality of belief in God, concepts of the nature of God, and many more.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlantinga, Mackie and Flew debated the logical validity of the free will defense as a way to solve the problem of evil.[37] Alston, grappling with the consequences of analytic philosophy of language, worked on the nature of religious language. Adams worked on the relationship of faith and morality.[38] Analytic epistemology and metaphysics has formed the basis for a number of philosophically-sophisticated theistic arguments, like those of the reformed epistemologists like Plantinga.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalytic philosophy of religion has also been preoccupied with Wittgenstein, as well as his interpretation of S?ren Kierkegaard's philosophy of religion.[39] Using first-hand remarks (which was later published in Philosophical Investigations, Culture and Value, and other works), philosophers such as Peter Winch and Norman Malcolm developed what has come to be known as contemplative philosophy, a Wittgensteinian school of thought rooted in the \\"Swansea tradition,\\" and which includes Wittgensteinians such as Rush Rhees, Peter Winch, and D. Z. Phillips, among others. The name \\"contemplative philosophy\\" was first coined by D. Z. Phillips in Philosophy's Cool Place, which rests on an interpretation of a passage from Wittgenstein's \\"Culture and Value.\\"[40] This interpretation was first labeled, \\"Wittgensteinian Fideism,\\" by Kai Nielsen but those who consider themselves Wittgensteinians in the Swansea tradition have relentlessly and repeatedly rejected this construal as a caricature of Wittgenstein's considered position; this is especially true of D. Z. Phillips.[41] Responding to this interpretation, Kai Nielsen and D. Z. Phillips became two of the most prominent philosophers on Wittgenstein's philosophy of religion.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent analytic political philosophy owes much to John Rawls, who in a series of papers from the 1950s onward (most notably \\"Two Concepts of Rules\\" and \\"Justice as Fairness\\") and his 1971 book A Theory of Justice, produced a sophisticated defence of a generally liberal egalitarian account of distributive justice. This was followed soon by Rawls's colleague Robert Nozick's book Anarchy, State, and Utopia, a defence of free-market libertarianism. Isaiah Berlin also had a lasting influence on both analytic political philosophy and Liberalism with his lecture the Two Concepts of Liberty.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring recent decades there have also been several critiques of liberalism, including the feminist critiques of Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, the communitarian critiques of Michael Sandel and Alasdair MacIntyre (although neither of them endorses the term), and the multiculturalist critiques of Amy Gutmann and Charles Taylor. Although not an analytic philosopher, Jrgen Habermas is another important- if controversial- author of contemporary analytic political philosophy, whose social theory is a blend of social science, Marxism, neo-Kantianism, and American pragmatism.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequentialist libertarianism also derives from the analytic tradition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother development of political philosophy was the emergence of the school of Analytical Marxism. Members of this school seek to apply techniques of analytic philosophy modern social science such as rational choice theory to clarify the theories of Karl Marx and his successors. The best-known member of this school is G. A. Cohen, whose 1978 work, Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence, is generally considered to represent the genesis of this school. In that book, Cohen used logical and linguistic analysis to clarify and defend Marx's materialist conception of history. Other prominent Analytical Marxists include the economist John Roemer, the social scientist Jon Elster, and the sociologist Erik Olin Wright. The work of these later philosophers have furthered Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.\\r\\n\\r\\nCohen himself would later engage directly with Rawlsian political philosophy to advance a socialist theory of justice that contrast with both traditional Marxism and the theories advanced by Rawls and Nozick. In particular, he indicates Marx's principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunitarians such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel advance a critique of Liberalism that uses analytic techniques to isolate the main assumptions of Liberal individualists, such as Rawls, and then challenges these assumptions. In particular, Communitarians challenge the Liberal assumption that the individual can be considered as fully autonomous from the community in which he lives and is brought up. Instead, they argue for a conception of the individual that emphasizes the role that the community plays in forming his or her values, thought processes and opinions.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne striking difference with respect to early analytic philosophy was the revival of metaphysical theorizing during the second half of the 20th century. Philosophers such as David Kellogg Lewis and David Armstrong developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity, and abstract objects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the developments that resulted in the revival of metaphysical theorizing were Quine's attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction, which was generally considered to weaken Carnap's distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.[43] Important also for the revival of metaphysics was the further development of modal logic, including the work of Saul Kripke, who argued in Naming and Necessity and elsewhere for the existence of essences and the possibility of necessary, a posteriori truths.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nMetaphysics remains a fertile topic of research, having recovered from the attacks of A.J. Ayer and the logical positivists. Although many discussions are continuations of old ones from previous decades and centuries, the debate remains active. The philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all become major concerns, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the philosophy of time have been revived.[45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nScience has also had an increasingly significant role in metaphysics. The theory of special relativity has had a profound effect on the philosophy of time, and quantum physics is routinely discussed in the free will debate.[46] The weight given to scientific evidence is largely due to widespread commitments among philosophers to scientific realism and naturalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophy of language is a topic that has decreased during the last four decades, as evidenced by the fact that few major philosophers today treat it as a primary research topic. Indeed, while the debate remains fierce, it is still strongly influenced by those authors from the first half of the century: Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Alfred Tarski, and W. V. O. Quine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Saul Kripke's publication Naming and Necessity, he argued influentially that flaws in common theories of proper names are indicative of larger misunderstandings of the metaphysics of necessity and possibility. By wedding the techniques of modal logic to a causal theory of reference, Kripke was widely regarded as reviving theories of essence and identity as respectable topics of philosophical discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother influential philosopher, Pavel Tichy initiated Transparent Intensional Logic, an original theory of the logical analysis of natural languages ÿ the theory is devoted to the problem of saying exactly what it is that we learn, know and can communicate when we come to understand what a sentence means.\\r\\n\\r\\nReacting against both the verificationism of the logical positivists as well as the critiques of the philosopher of science Karl Popper, who had suggested the falsifiability criterion on which to judge the demarcation between science and non-science, discussions of philosophy of science during the last 40 years were dominated by social constructivist and cognitive relativist theories of science. Thomas Samuel Kuhn with his formulation of paradigm shifts and Paul Feyerabend with his epistemological anarchism are significant for these discussions.[47] The philosophy of biology has also undergone considerable growth, particularly due to the considerable debate in recent years over the nature of evolution, particularly natural selection.[48] Daniel Dennett and his 1995 book Darwin's Dangerous Idea, which defends Neo-Darwinism, stand at the foreground of this debate.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing largely to Gettier's 1963 paper \\"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\\", epistemology resurged as a topic of analytic philosophy during the last 50 years. A large portion of current epistemological research is intended to resolve the problems that Gettier's examples presented to the traditional justified true belief model of knowledge, including developing theories of justification in order to deal with Gettier's examples, or giving alternatives to the justified true belief model. Other and related topics of contemporary research include debates between internalism and externalism,[50] basic knowledge, the nature of evidence, the value of knowledge, epistemic luck, virtue epistemology, the role of intuitions in justification, and treating knowledge as a primitive concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of attacks on the traditional aesthetic notions of beauty and sublimity from post-modern thinkers, analytic philosophers were slow to consider art and aesthetic judgment. Susanne Langer[51] and Nelson Goodman[52] addressed these problems in an analytic style during the 1950s and 1960s. Since Goodman, aesthetics as a discipline for analytic philosophers has flourished.[53] Rigorous efforts to pursue analyses of traditional aesthetic concepts were performed by Guy Sircello in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in new analytic theories of love,[54] sublimity,[55] and beauty.[56]","input":"Who founded the philosophical school known as analytic philosophy?"},{"output":"President pro tempore","context":"The Presiding Officer of the United States Senate is the person who presides over the United States Senate and is charged with maintaining order and decorum, recognizing members to speak, and interpreting the Senate's rules, practices, and precedents. Senate presiding officer is a role, not an actual office. The actual role is usually performed by one of three officials: the Vice President of the United States, an elected United States Senator, or the Chief Justice of the United States (but the last only in special cases). Outside the constitutionally mandated roles, the actual appointment of a person to do the job of presiding over the Senate as a body is governed by Rule I of the Standing Rules of the United States Senate.\\r\\nThe Vice President of the United States is assigned the responsibility by the Constitution of presiding over the Senate and designated as its president. The vice president has the authority (ex officio, for he or she is not an elected member of the Senate) to cast a tie-breaking vote. Early Vice Presidents took an active role in regularly presiding over proceedings of the body, with the President pro tempore only being called on during the Vice President's absence. During the 20th century, the role of the vice president evolved into more of an executive branch position. Now, the vice president is usually seen as an integral part of a president's administration and presides over the Senate only on ceremonial occasions or when a tie-breaking vote may be needed.[1]\\r\\nThe U.S. Constitution also provides for appointment of one of the elected Senators to serve as President pro tempore. This Senator presides when the vice president was absent from the body. The President pro tempore is selected by the body specifically for the role of presiding in the absence of (as the meaning of pro tempore, literally \\"for the time being\\") the actual presiding officer. By tradition, the title of President pro tempore has come to be given more-or-less automatically to the most senior senator of the majority party. In actual practice in the modern Senate, the President pro tempore also does not often serve in the role (though it is his or her constitutional right to do so), instead, as governed by the aforementioned Rule I, he or she frequently designates a junior senator to perform the function.\\r\\nWhen the Senate hears the impeachment trials of the President of the United States, by procedure established in the U.S Constitution, the Chief Justice of the United States is designated as the presiding officer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Constitution provides for two officers to preside over the Senate. Article One, Section 3, Clause 4 designates the Vice President of the United States as the President of the Senate. In this capacity, the vice president was expected to preside at regular sessions of the Senate, casting votes only to break ties. From John Adams in 1789 to Richard Nixon in the 1950s, presiding over the Senate was the chief function of vice presidents, who had an office in the Capitol, received their staff support and office expenses through the legislative appropriations, and rarely were invited to participate in cabinet meetings or other executive activities. In 1961, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson changed the vice presidency by moving his chief office from the Capitol to the White House, by directing his attention to executive functions, and by attending Senate sessions only at critical times when his vote, or ruling from the chair, might be necessary. Vice presidents since Johnson's time have followed his example.[2]\\r\\nNext, Article One, Section 3, Clause 5 provides that in the absence of the vice president the Senate could choose a president pro tempore to temporarily preside and perform the duties of the chair. Since vice presidents presided routinely in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Senate thought it necessary to choose a president pro tempore only for the limited periods when the vice president might be ill or otherwise absent. As a result, the Senate frequently elected several presidents pro tempore during a single session.[2]\\r\\nOn three occasions during the 19th century, the Senate was without both a president and a president pro tempore:\\r\\nAdditionally, Article One, Section 3, Clause 6 grants to the Senate the sole power to try federal impeachments and spells out the basic procedures for impeachment trials. Among the requirements is the stipulation that the Chief Justice is to preside over presidential impeachment trials. This rule underscores the solemnity of the occasion and aims, in part, to avoid the possible conflict of interest of a Vice President's presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between them and the presidency.[3] This has occurred only twice:\\r\\nAccording to Article One, Section 5, Clause 2 of the U.S. constitution, the Senate is allowed to establish, for itself, its own rules of operations, including the roles and duties of the presiding officer. Those rules are known as the Standing Rules of the United States Senate, and Rule I deals with the appointment of a person to act as the chair, or presiding officer, for normal Senate proceedings. It recognizes the constitutionally mandated roles of Vice President and President pro tempore, but goes further to allow for the appointment of an Acting President pro tempore, and further allows for the President pro tempore to also designate any other senator to perform his duties. As a result, during the day-to-day operation of the body, it is rare for the actual presiding role to be handled by the President pro tempore (and rarer still for the Vice President to do so). Instead, a designated junior senator is most commonly appointed to do the job.\\r\\nThe presiding officer is usually addressed as \\"Mr. President\\" or \\"Madame President.\\" One exception is during impeachment trials of the president; the Chief Justice was referred to as \\"Mr. Chief Justice\\" both in 1868 and in 1999 while presiding over the Senate.[4]\\r\\nDuring joint sessions of Congress in which the President of the United States is giving the address, practices have varied as to how the President refers to the Vice President. President Barack Obama and his immediate predecessor George W. Bush have addressed the Vice President as \\"Vice President Biden\\" (in 2010) and \\"Vice President Cheney\\" (in 2008 and several previous years), or as \\"Mr. Vice President\\" (George W. Bush in 2001). However, earlier presidents referred to the Vice President as \\"Mr. President\\" while addressing a joint session of Congress; Eisenhower, for instance, did so in 1960, and George H. W. Bush did so in 1991.\\r\\nThis list includes all Presidents of the Senate (the Vice Presidents of the United States), those Presidents pro tempore of the Senate who presided during intraÿterm vacancies in the vice presidency or when the Vice President was acting as President of the United States, and those Chief Justices who presided during presidential impeachment trials. It does not include Presidents pro tempore who presided over sessions temporarily during an absence of the Senate President, or junior senators designated by the President pro tempore to preside temporarily.","input":"Who is the backup leader of the senate?"},{"output":"American Captain John Davis","context":"The history of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe. The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD.\\r\\nThe rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. In 1773 James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time but although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. It is believed he was as close as 150?mi (241.4?km) from the mainland.\\r\\nIn 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted the ice shelf or the continent. A Russian expedition was led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, a British expedition was captained by Edward Bransfield and an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer participated. The first landing was probably just over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.\\r\\nSeveral expeditions attempted to reach the South Pole in the early 20th century, during the 'Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration'. Many resulted in injury and death. Norwegian Roald Amundsen finally reached the Pole on December 14, 1911, following a dramatic race with the Englishman Robert Falcon Scott.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Western world, belief in a Cold Landa vast continent located in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" out the northern lands of Europe, Asia and North Africahad existed for centuries. Aristotle had postulated a symmetry of the earth, which meant that there would be equally habitable lands south of the known world. The Greeks suggested that these two hemispheres, north and south, were divided by a \\"belt of fire\\", due to the general observation that the climate got warmer and warmer the further south someone travelled, and no Europeans had gone past the equator to see that this was not the case.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt was not until Prince Henry the Navigator began in 1418 to encourage the penetration of the torrid zone in the effort to reach India by circumnavigating Africa that European exploration of the southern hemisphere began. In 1473 Portuguese navigator Lopes Gon?alves proved that the equator could be crossed, and cartographers and sailors began to assume the existence of another, temperate continent to the south of the known world.\\r\\nThe doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist.\\r\\nFerdinand Magellan, who passed through the Straits of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land, and it appeared as such on a map by Ortelius: Terra australis recenter inventa sed nondum plene cognita (\\"Southern land recently discovered but not yet fully known\\").[citation needed]\\r\\nEuropean geographers connected the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land or Third World was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries. In 1599, according to the account of Jacob le Maire, the Dutch Dirck Gerritsz Pomp observed mountainous land at latitude (64). If so, these were the South Shetland Islands, and possibly the first European sighting of Antarctica (or offshore-lying islands belonging to it). Other accounts, however, do not note this observation, casting doubt on their accuracy. It has been argued that the Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla claimed to have sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64 S in 1603, but this claim is not generally recognized.\\r\\nQuir܇s in 1606 took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\".\\r\\nFrancis Drake like Spanish explorers before him had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. Indeed, when Schouten and Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land.\\r\\nFinally, in 1642 Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent. Voyagers round the Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\\r\\nThe visit to South Georgia by the English merchant Anthony de la Roch in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence.[1][2] Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict Roch Island, honouring the discoverer.\\r\\nJames Cook was aware of la Roch's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.[3]\\r\\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52?S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140?mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" ÿ described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" ÿ resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 5410?S, and in the navigation of 48 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55?S in 1730 .\\r\\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\" He lighted upon a land in 50?S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.[4]\\r\\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with the Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and the Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58?S, and then 30 eastward for the most part south of 60?S, a higher southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67 15' S by 39 35' E, where their course was stopped by ice.\\r\\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10 too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61 52 S by 95?E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60?S to 147?E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60?S by 177?W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching 67 31 S to stand north again in 135?W.\\r\\nA long detour to 47 50 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109 30 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71 10 S by 106 54 W. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53 and 57?S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55 and 60. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and of no economic value.[4]\\r\\nAdmiral Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen was one of the first to spot the continent of Antarctica. The first land south of the parallel 60 south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\\r\\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,[5][6][7] three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the Royal Navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut.\\r\\nIt is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached on 28 January 1820 a point within 32?km (20?mi) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 692128S 21450W? / ?69.35778S 2.24722W? / -69.35778; -2.24722[8] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\\r\\nThe first landing on the Antarctic mainland, was according to the American Captain John Davis, a sealer, who claimed to have set foot there on 7 February 1821,[9] though this is not accepted by all historians.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn December 1821, Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer looking for seal breeding grounds, sighted what is now known as the Antarctic Peninsula, located between 55 and 80 degrees west. In 1823, James Weddell, a British sealer, sailed into what is now known as the Weddell Sea. Until, the twentieth century, most expeditions were for commercial purpose, to look for the prospects of seal and whale hunting. A piece of wood, from the South Shetland Islands, was the first fossil ever recorded from Antarctica, obtained during a private United States expedition during 1829-31, commanded by Captain Benjamin Pendleton.[10][11][12]\\r\\nCharles Wilkes, as commander of a United States Navy expedition in 1840,[13] discovered what is now known as Wilkes Land, a section of the continent around 120 degrees East.\\r\\nAfter the North Magnetic Pole was located in 1831, explorers and scientists began looking for the South Magnetic Pole. One of the explorers, James Clark Ross, a British naval officer, identified its approximate location, but was unable to reach it on his 4 year-expedition from 1839 to 1843. Commanding the British ships Erebus and Terror, he braved the pack ice and approached what is now known as the Ross Ice Shelf, a massive floating ice shelf over 100 feet (30?m) high. His expedition sailed eastward along the southern Antarctic coast discovering mountains which were since named after his ships: Mount Erebus, the most active volcano on Antarctica, and Mount Terror.[13]\\r\\nThe first documented landing on the mainland of East Antarctica was at Victoria Land by the American sealer Mercator Cooper on 26 January 1853.[14]\\r\\nThese explorers, despite their impressive contributions to South Polar exploration, were unable to penetrate the interior of the continent and, rather, formed a broken line of discovered lands along the coastline of Antarctica. What followed this period of Antarctic interest is what historian H.R. Mill called 'the age of averted interest'.[15] Following the expedition South by the ships Erebus and Terror under James Clark Ross (January, 1841), he suggested that there were no scientific discoveries, or 'problems', worth exploration in the far South.[15]\\r\\nIt is considered that Ross' influence, as well as the loss of the Franklin expedition in the Arctic, lead to disinterest in polar interest, particularly by the Royal Society - the organization that helped oversee many Arctic explorations, including those that would be made by Shackleton and Scott. However, in the following twenty years after Ross' return, there was a general lull internationally in Antarctic exploration.[15]\\r\\nThe Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration began at the end of the 19th century and closed with Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1917.[16]\\r\\nDuring this period the Antarctic continent became the focus of an international effort that resulted in intensive scientific and geographical exploration and in which 17 major Antarctic expeditions were launched from ten countries.[17]\\r\\nThe initial impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given by Dr. John Murray entitled \\"The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration\\", given to the Royal geographical Society in London, November 27, 1893.[18] Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic should be organised to \\"resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south\\".[19] Furthermore, the Royal Geographic Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully encouraged many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and laid the groundwork for the lecture given by Murray.[20]\\r\\nThe Norwegian ship Antarctic was put ashore at Cape Adare, on January 24, 1895.[21]\\r\\nIn August 1895 the Sixth International Geographical Congress in London passed a general resolution calling on scientific societies throughout the world to promote the cause of Antarctic exploration \\"in whatever ways seem to them most effective\\".[22] Such work would \\"bring additions to almost every branch of science\\".[22] The Congress had been addressed by the Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink, who had just returned from a whaling expedition during which he had become one of the first to set foot on the Antarctic mainland. During his address, Borchgrevink outlined plans for a full-scale pioneering Antarctic expedition, to be based at Cape Adare.[23][24]\\r\\nThe Heroic Age was inaugurated by an expedition launched by the Belgian Geographical Society in 1897; Borchgrevink followed a year later with a privately sponsored British expedition.[25] (Some histories consider the Discovery expedition, which departed in 1901, as the first proper expedition of the Heroic Age.[26])\\r\\nThe Belgian Antarctic Expedition was led by Belgian Adrian de Gerlache. In 1898, they became the first men to spend winter on Antarctica, when their ship Belgica became trapped in the ice. They became stuck on 28 February 1898, and only managed to get out of the ice on 14 March 1899.\\r\\nDuring their forced stay, several men lost their sanity, not only because of the Antarctic winter night and the endured hardship, but also because of the language problems between the different nationalities. This was the first expedition to overwinter within the Antarctic Circle,[27][28] and they visited the South Shetland Islands.[29]\\r\\nThe Southern Cross Expedition began in 1898 and lasted for two years. This was the first expedition to overwinter on the Antarctic mainland (Cape Adare) and was the first to make use of dogs and sledges. It made the first ascent of The Great Ice Barrier, (The Great Ice Barrier later became formally known as the Ross Ice Shelf). The expedition set a Farthest South record at 7830'S. It also calculated the location of the South Magnetic Pole.[30][31]\\r\\nThe Discovery Expedition was then launched, from 1901ÿ04 and was led by Robert Falcon Scott. It made the first ascent of the Western Mountains in Victoria Land, and discovered the polar plateau. Its southern journey set a new Farthest South record, 8217'S. Many other geographical features were discovered, mapped and named. This was the first of several expeditions based in McMurdo Sound.[32][33][34]\\r\\nA year later, the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition was launched, headed by William Speirs Bruce. 'Ormond House' was established as a meteorological observatory on Laurie Island in the South Orkneys and was the first permanent base in Antarctica. The Weddell Sea was penetrated to 7401'S, and the coastline of Coats Land was discovered, defining the sea's eastern limits.[35][36][37]\\r\\nErnest Shackleton, who had been a member of Scott's expedition, organized and led the Nimrod Expedition from 1907 to 1909. The expedition's primary objective was of reaching the South Pole. Based in McMurdo Sound, the expedition pioneered the Beardmore Glacier route to the South Pole, and the (limited) use of motorised transport. Its southern march reached 8823'S, a new Farthest South record 97 geographical miles from the Pole before having to turn back. During the expedition, Shackleton was the first to reach the polar plateau. Parties led by T. W. Edgeworth David also became the first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole.[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe First German Antarctic Expedition was sent to investigate eastern Antarctica in 1901. It discovered the coast of Kaiser Wilhelm II Land, and Mount Gauss. The expedition's ship became trapped in ice, however, which prevented more extensive exploration.[41][42][43]\\r\\nThe Swedish Antarctic Expedition, operating at the same time worked in the east coastal area of Graham Land, and was marooned on Snow Hill Island and Paulet Island in the Weddell Sea, after the sinking of its expedition ship. It was rescued by the Argentinian naval vessel Uruguay.[44][45][46]\\r\\nThe French organized their first expedition in 1903 under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Charcot. Originally intended as a relief expedition for the stranded Nordenski?ld party, the main work of this expedition was the mapping and charting of islands and the western coasts of Graham Land, on the Antarctic peninsula. A section of the coast was explored, and named Loubet Land after the President of France.[47][48][49]\\r\\nA follow up trip was organized from 1908ÿ10 which continued the earlier work of the French expedition with a general exploration of the Bellingshausen Sea, and the discovery of islands and other features, including Marguerite Bay, Charcot Island, Renaud Island, Mikkelsen Bay, Rothschild Island.[50]\\r\\nThe prize of the Heroic age was to reach the South Pole. Two expeditions set off in 1910 to attain this goal; a party led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram and Robert Falcon Scott's British group from the Terra Nova.\\r\\nAmundsen succeeded in reaching the Pole on 14 December 1911 using a route from the Bay of Whales to the polar plateau via the Axel Heiberg Glacier.[51][52][53]\\r\\nScott and his four companions reached the South Pole via the Beardmore route on 17 January 1912, 33 days after Amundsen. All five died on the return journey from the Pole, through a combination of starvation and cold.[54] The AmundsenÿScott South Pole Station was later named after these two men.\\r\\nThe Australasian Antarctic Expedition took place between 1911-1914 and was led by Sir Douglas Mawson. It concentrated on the stretch of Antarctic coastline between Cape Adare and Mount Gauss, carrying out mapping and survey work on coastal and inland territories.\\r\\nDiscoveries included Commonwealth Bay, Ninnis Glacier, Mertz Glacier, and Queen Mary Land. Major accomplishments were made in geology, glaciology and terrestrial biology.[55]\\r\\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914-1917 was led by Ernest Shackleton and set out to cross the continent via the South pole. However, their ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by pack ice in the Weddell Sea before they were able to land. The expedition members survived after a journey on sledges over pack ice, a prolonged drift on an ice-floe, and a voyage in three small boats to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean in an open boat called James Caird and made the first crossing of South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.[56]\\r\\nA related component of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was the Ross Sea party, led by Aeneas Mackintosh. Its objective was to lay depots across the Great Ice Barrier, in order to supply Shackleton's party crossing from the Weddell Sea. All the required depots were laid, but in the process three men, including the leader Mackintosh, lost their lives.[57]\\r\\nShackleton's last expedition and the one that brought the 'Heroic Age' to a close, was the ShackletonÿRowett Expedition from 1921-1922 on board the ship Quest. Its vaguely defined objectives included coastal mapping, a possible continental circumnavigation, the investigation of sub-Antarctic islands, and oceanographic work. After Shackleton's death on 5 January 1922, Quest completed a shortened programme before returning home.| [58]\\r\\nAfter Shackleton's last expedition, there was a hiatus in Antarctic exploration for about seven years. From 1929, aircraft and mechanized transportation were increasingly used, earning this period the sobriquet of the 'Mechanical Age'. Hubert Wilkins first visited Antarctica in 1921-1922 as an ornithologist attached to the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition. From 1927, Wilkins and pilot Carl Ben Eielson began exploring the Arctic by aircraft.[59]\\r\\nOn 15 April 1928, only a year after Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic, Wilkins and Eielson made a trans-Arctic crossing from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Spitsbergen, arriving about 20 hours later on 16 April, touching along the way at Grant Land on Ellesmere Island.[60] For this feat and his prior work, Wilkins was knighted.\\r\\nWith financial backing from William Randolph Hearst, Wilkins returned to the South Pole and flew over Antarctica in the San Francisco. He named the island of Hearst Land after his sponsor.\\r\\nUS Navy Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd led five expeditions to Antarctica during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. He overflew the South Pole with pilot Bernt Balchen on November 28 and 29, 1929, to match his overflight of the North Pole in 1926. Byrd's explorations had science as a major objective and extensively used the aircraft to explore the continent.\\r\\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947ÿ1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.[61] The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith Ronne.[62] Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sledmore than any other explorer in history.[63]\\r\\nThe 1955ÿ58 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition successfully completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica, via the South Pole. Although supported by the British and other Commonwealth governments, most of the funding came from corporate and individual donations.\\r\\nIt was headed by British explorer Dr Vivian Fuchs, with New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary leading the New Zealand Ross Sea Support team. After spending the winter of 1957 at Shackleton Base, Fuchs finally set out on the transcontinental journey in November 1957, with a twelve-man team travelling in six vehicles; three Sno-Cats, two Weasels and one specially adapted Muskeg tractor. On route, the team were also tasked with carrying out scientific research including seismic soundings and gravimetric readings.\\r\\nIn parallel Hillary's team had set up Scott Base?ÿ which was to be Fuchs' final destination?ÿ on the opposite side of the continent at McMurdo Sound on the Ross Sea. Using three converted Massey Ferguson TE20 tractors[64] and one Weasel (abandoned part-way), Hillary and his three men (Ron Balham, Peter Mulgrew and Murray Ellis), were responsible for route-finding and laying a line of supply depots up the Skelton Glacier and across the Polar Plateau on towards the South Pole, for the use of Fuchs on the final leg of his journey. Other members of Hillary's team carried out geological surveys around the Ross Sea and Victoria Land areas.\\r\\nHillary's party reached the South Pole on January 3, 1958, and was just the third (preceded by Amundsen in 1911 and Scott in 1912) to reach the Pole overland. Fuchs' team reached the Pole from the opposite direction on 19 January 1958, where they met up with Hillary. Fuchs then continued overland, following the route that Hillary had laid and on 2 March succeeded in reaching Scott Base, completing the first overland crossing of the continent by land via the South Pole.[13]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom reasserted sovereignty over the Falkland Islands in the far South Atlantic in 1833 and maintained a continuous presence there. In 1908, the British government extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over \\"South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, and the Sandwich Islands, and Graham's Land, situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, and lying between the 20th and the 80th degrees of west longitude\\".[65] All these territories were administered as Falkland Islands Dependencies from Stanley by the Governor of the Falkland Islands. The motivation for this declaration lay in the need for regulating and taxing the whaling industry effectively. Commercial operators would hunt whales in areas outside of the official boundaries of the Falkland Islands and its dependencies and there was a need to close this loophole.\\r\\nIn 1917, the wording of the claim was modified, so as to, among other things, unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the South Pole (thus encompassing all of the present-day British Antarctic Territory). The new claim covered \\"all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the 50th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 58th parallel of south latitude\\".[65]\\r\\nUnder the ambition of Leopold Amery, the Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, Britain attempted to incorporate the entire continent into the Empire. In a memorandum to the governor-generals for Australia and New Zealand, he wrote that 'with the exception of Chile and Argentina and some barren islands belonging to France... it is desirable that the whole of the Antarctic should ultimately be included in the British Empire.'\\r\\nThe first step was taken on 30 July 1923, when the British government passed an Order in Council under the British Settlements Act 1887, defining the new borders for the Ross Dependency - \\"that part of His Majesty's Dominions in the Antarctic Seas, which comprises all the islands and territories between the 160th degree of East Longitude and the 150th degree of West Longitude which are situated south of the 60th degree of South Latitude shall be named the Ross Dependency.\\"\\r\\nThe Order in Council then went on to appoint the Governor-General and Commander-in Chief of New Zealand as the Governor of the territory.[66]\\r\\nIn 1930, the United Kingdom claimed Enderby Land. In 1933, a British imperial order transferred territory south of 60 S and between meridians 160 E and 45 E to Australia as the Australian Antarctic Territory.[67][68]\\r\\nFollowing the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931, the government of the United Kingdom relinquished all control over the government of New Zealand and Australia. This however had no bearing on the obligations of the Governor-General of both countries in their capacity as Governor of the Antarctic territories.\\r\\nMeanwhile, alarmed by these unilateral declarations, the French government laid claim to a strip of the continent in 1924. The basis for their claim to Adlie Land lay on the discovery of the coastline in 1840 by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who named it after his wife, Adle.[69] The British eventually decided to recognize this claim and the border between Adlie Land and Australian Antarctic Territory was fixed definitively in 1938.[70]\\r\\nThese developments also concerned Norwegian whaling interests, who wished to avoid the British taxation of whaling stations in the Antarctic and were concerned that they would be commercially excluded from the continent. The whale-ship owner Lars Christensen financed several expeditions to the Antarctic with the view to claim land for Norway and establish stations on Norwegian territory to gain better privileges.[71] The first expedition, led by Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad, landed on Peter I Island in 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. On 6 March 1931, a Norwegian royal proclamation declared the island under Norwegian sovereignty[71] and on 23 March 1933 the island was declared a dependency.[72]\\r\\nThe 1929 expedition led by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Ltzow-Holm named the continental land mass near the island as Queen Maud Land, named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales.[73] The territory was explored further during the Norvegia expedition of 1930ÿ31.[74] Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20W.[74]\\r\\nNorway's claim was disputed by Nazi Germany,[75] which in 1938 dispatched the German Antarctic Expedition, led by Alfred Ritscher, to fly over as much of it as possible.[74] The ship Schwabenland reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939.[76] During the expedition, an area of about 350,000 square kilometres (140,000?sq?mi) was photographed from the air by Ritscher,[77] who dropped darts inscribed with swastikas every 26 kilometres (16?mi). Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name New Swabia, but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the Second World War.[75]\\r\\nOn 14 January 1939, five days prior to the German arrival, Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway,[73] after a royal decree announced that the land bordering the Falkland Islands Dependencies in the west and the Australian Antarctic Dependency in the east was to be brought under Norwegian sovereignty.[74] The primary basis for the annexation was to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region.[73][78] In 1948, Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to from 20W to 45E, and that the Bruce Coast and Coats Land were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory.[74]\\r\\nThis encroachment of foreign powers was a matter of immense disquiet to the nearby South American countries, Argentina and Chile. Taking advantage of a European continent plunged into turmoil with the onset of the Second World War, Chile's president, Pedro Aguirre Cerda declared the establishment of a Chilean Antarctic Territory in areas already claimed by Britain.\\r\\nArgentina had an even longer history of involvement in the Continent. Already in 1904 the Argentine government began a permanent occupation in the area with the purchase of a meteorological station on Laurie Island established in 1903 by Dr William S. Bruce's Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Bruce offered to transfer the station and instruments for the sum of 5.000 pesos, on the condition that the government committed itself to the continuation of the scientific mission.[79] British officer William Haggard also sent a note to the Argentine Foreign Minister, Jose Terry, ratifying the terms of Bruce proposition.[79]\\r\\nIn 1906, Argentina communicated to the international community the establishment of a permanent base on South Orkney Islands. However, Haggard responded by reminding Argentina that the South Orkneys were British. The British position was that Argentine personnel was granted permission only for the period of one year. The Argentine government entered into negotiations with the British in 1913 over the possible transfer of the island. Although these talks were unsuccessful, Argentina attempted to unilaterally establish their sovereignty with the erection of markers, national flags and other symbols. [80] Finally, with British attention elsewhere, Argentina declared the establishment of Argentine Antarctica in 1943, claiming territory that overlapped with British ( 20W to 80W) and the earlier Chilean (53W to 90W) claims.\\r\\nIn response to this and earlier German explorations, the British Admiralty and Colonial Office launched Operation Tabarin in 1943 to reassert British territorial claims against Argentine and Chilean incursion and establish a permanent British presence in the Antarctic.[81] The move was also motivated by concerns within the Foreign Office about the direction of United States post-war activity in the region.\\r\\nA suitable cover story was the need to deny use of the area to the enemy. The Kriegsmarine was known to use remote islands as rendezvous points and as shelters for commerce raiders, U-boats and supply ships. Also, in 1941, there existed a fear that Japan might attempt to seize the Falkland Islands, either as a base or to hand them over to Argentina, thus gaining political advantage for the Axis and denying their use to Britain.\\r\\nIn 1943, British personnel from HMS Carnarvon Castle[82] removed Argentine flags from Deception Island. The expedition was led by Lieutenant James Marr and left the Falkland Islands in two ships, HMS William Scoresby (a minesweeping trawler) and Fitzroy, on Saturday January 29, 1944.\\r\\nBases were established during February near the abandoned Norwegian whaling station on Deception Island, where the Union Flag was hoisted in place of Argentine flags, and at Port Lockroy (on February 11) on the coast of Graham Land. A further base was founded at Hope Bay on February 13, 1945, after a failed attempt to unload stores on February 7, 1944. Symbols of British sovereignty, including post offices, signposts and plaques were also constructed and postage stamps were issued.\\r\\nOperation Tabarin provoked Chile to organize its First Chilean Antarctic Expedition in 1947-48, where the Chilean president Gabriel Gonzlez Videla personally inaugurated one of its bases.[83]\\r\\nFollowing the end of the war in 1945, the British bases were handed over to civilian members of the newly created Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (subsequently the British Antarctic Survey) the first such national scientific body to be established in Antarctica.\\r\\nFriction between Britain and the Latin American states continued into the post war period. Royal Navy warships were despatched in 1948 to prevent naval incursions and in 1952, an Argentine shore party at Hope Bay (the British Base \\"D\\", established there in 1945, came up against the Argentine Esperanza Base, est. 1952) fired a machine gun over the heads of a British Antarctic Survey team unloading supplies from the John Biscoe. The Argentines later extended a diplomatic apology, saying that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Argentine military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority.\\r\\nThe United States became politically interested in the Antarctic continent before and during WWII. The United States Antarctic Service Expedition, from 1939-1941, was sponsored by the government with additional support came from donations and gifts by private citizens, corporations and institutions. The objectives of the Expedition, outlined by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was to establish two bases: East Base, in the vicinity of Charcot Island, and West Base, in the vicinity of King Edward VII Land. After operating successfully for two years, but with international tensions on the rise, it was considered wise to evacuate the two bases.[84] However,\\r\\nImmediately after the war, American interest was rekindled with an explicitly geopolitical motive. Operation Highjump, from 1946-1947 was organized by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd Jr. and included 4,700 men, 13 ships, and multiple aircraft. The primary mission of Operation Highjump was to establish the Antarctic research base Little America IV,[85] for the purpose of training personnel and testing equipment in frigid conditions and amplifying existing stores of knowledge of hydrographic, geographic, geological, meteorological and electromagnetic propagation conditions in the area. The mission was also aimed at consolidating and extending United States sovereignty over the largest practicable area of the Antarctic continent, although this was publicly denied as a goal even before the expedition ended.\\r\\nMeanwhile, in an attempt at ending the impasse, Britain submitted an application to the International Court of Justice in 1955 to adjudicate between the territorial claims of Britain, Argentina and Chile. This proposal failed, as both Latin American countries rejected submitting to an international arbitration procedure.[86]\\r\\nNegotiations towards the establishment of an international condominium over the continent first began in 1948, involving the 7 claimant powers (Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France, Norway, Chile and Argentina) and the US. This attempt was aimed at excluding the Soviet Union from the affairs of the continent and rapidly fell apart when the USSR declared an interest in the region, refused to recognize any claims of sovereignty and reserved the right to make its own claims in 1950.[86]\\r\\nAn important impetus toward the formation of the Antarctic Treaty System in 1959, was the International Geophysical Year, 1957-1958. This year of international scientific cooperation triggered an 18-month period of intense Antarctic science. More than 70 existing national scientific organizations then formed IGY committees, and participated in the cooperative effort. The British established Halley Research Station in 1956 by an expedition from the Royal Society. Sir Vivian Fuchs headed the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which completed the first overland crossing of Antarctica in 1958. In Japan, the Japan Maritime Safety Agency offered ice breaker Sya as the South Pole observation ship and Showa Station was built as the first Japanese observation base on Antarctica.\\r\\nFrance contributed with Dumont d'Urville Station and Charcot Station in Adlie Land. The ship Commandant Charcot of the French Navy spent nine months of 1949/50 at the coast of Adelie Land, performing ionospheric soundings.[87] The US erected the AmundsenÿScott South Pole Station as the first permanent structure directly over the South Pole in January 1957.[88]\\r\\nFinally, to prevent the possibility of military conflict in the region, the United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and 9 other countries with significant interests negotiated and signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959. The treaty entered into force in 1961 and sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and banned military activity on that continent. The treaty was the first arms control agreement established during the Cold War.[89]\\r\\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born farther south than anyone in history.[90]\\r\\nOn 28 November 1979, an Air New Zealand DC-10 on a sightseeing trip crashed into Mount Erebus on Ross Island, killing all 257 people on board.\\r\\nIn 1991 a convention among member nations of the Antarctic Treaty on how to regulate mining and drilling was proposed. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke and French Prime Minister Michel Rocard led a response to this convention that resulted in the adoption of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, now known as the Madrid Protocol. All mineral extraction was banned for 50 years and the Antarctic was set aside as a \\"natural reserve, devoted to peace and science\\".[91]\\r\\nB?rge Ousland, a Norwegian explorer, finished the first unassisted Antarctic solo crossing on January 18, 1997.\\r\\nOn 23 November 2007, the MS Explorer struck an iceberg and sank, but all on board were rescued by nearby ships, including a passing Norwegian cruise ship, the MS Nordnorge.\\r\\nWomen were originally kept from exploring Antarctica until well into the 1950s. A few pioneering women visited the Antarctic land and waters prior to the 1950s and many women requested to go on early expeditions, but were turned away.[92] Early pioneers such as Louise Sguin[93] and Ingrid Christensen were some of the first women to see Antarctic waters.[94] Christensen was the first woman to set foot on the mainland of Antarctica.[94] The first women to have any fanfare about their Antarctic journeys were Caroline Mikkelsen who set foot on an island of Antarctica in 1935,[95] and Jackie Ronne and Jennie Darlington who were the first women to over-winter in Antarctica in 1947.[96] The first woman scientist to work in Antarctica was Maria Klenova in 1956.[97] Silvia Morella de Palma was the first woman to give birth in Antarctica, delivering 3.4?kg (7?lb 8 oz) Emilio Palma at the Argentine Esperanza base 7 January 1978.\\r\\nWomen faced legal barriers and sexism that prevented most from visiting Antarctica and doing research until the late 1960s. The United States Congress banned American women from traveling to Antarctica until 1969.[98] Women were often excluded because it was thought that they could not handle the extreme temperatures or crisis situations.[99] The first woman from the British Antarctic Survey to go to Antarctica was Janet Thomson in 1983 who described the ban on women as a \\"rather improper segregation.\\"[100][101]\\r\\nOnce women were allowed in Antarctica, they still had to fight against sexism and sexual harassment.[102][103] However, a tipping point was reached in the mid 1990s when it became the new normal that women were part of Antarctic life.[104] Women began to see a change as more and more women began working and researching in Antarctica.[105]\\r\\nCoordinates: 6715S 3935E? / ?67.250S 39.583E? / -67.250; 39.583","input":"Who was the first person to set foot on antarctica?"},{"output":"St. John's","context":"","input":"Which canadian city was one of the earliest permanent settlements?"},{"output":"Ramavriksha Benipuri","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJayaprakash Narayan (?listen?(help{info); 11 October 1902?ÿ 8 October 1979), popularly referred to as JP or Lok Nayak (Hindi for The People's Leader), was an Indian independence activist, theorist, communist and political leader, remembered especially for leading the mid-1970s opposition against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, for whose overthrow he called a \\"total revolution\\". His biography, Jayaprakash, was written by his nationalist friend and an eminent writer of Hindi literature, Ramavriksha Benipuri. In 1999, he was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in recognition of his social work. Other awards include the Magsaysay award for Public Service in 1965.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayprakash Narayan was born on 11 October 1902[1] in the village of Sitabdiara (It was in Saran district of Bihar when JP was born. At present it is in Ballia district of Uttar Pradesh, India).[2] Sitabdiara is a large village, straddling two states and three districtsChhapra and Arrah in Bihar and Ballia in Uttar Pradesh.[3] His house was near the banks of the flood-prone Ghagra river in Lala Tola, Bihar. Every time the river swelled, the house would get a little bit damaged, eventually forcing the family to move a few kilometres away to a settlement which is now known as Jay Prakash Nagar and falls in Uttar Pradesh. He came from a kayastha family.[4] He was the fourth child of Harsu Dayal and Phul Rani Devi. His father Harsu Dayal was a junior official in the Canal Department of the State government and was often touring the region. When Narayan was 9 years old, he left his village to enroll in 7th class of the collegiate school at Patna.[5] This was his first break from village life. JP stayed at a student hostelSaraswati Bhawanin which most of the boys were a bit older. Among them were some of Bihar's future leaders including its first chief minister, Krishna Singh, his deputy Anugrah Narayan Sinha and several others who were to widely become known in politics and academic world.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1920, 18 year old Narayan got married to Braj Kishore Prasad's 14 year old daughter Prabhavati Devi, a freedom fighter in her own right.[8], their ages being normal marriageable ages at those times. After their wedding, since Narayan was working in Patna and it was difficult for his wife to stay with him, on the invitation of Gandhi, Prabhavati became an inmate at Sabarmati Ashram (Ahmedabad).[9] Jayaprakash, along with some friends, went to listen to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad speak about the Non-co-operation movement launched by Gandhi against the passing of the Rowlatt Act of 1919. The Maulana was a brilliant orator and his call to give up English education was \\"like leaves before a storm: Jayaprakash was swept away and momentarily lifted up to the skies. That brief experience of soaring up with the winds of a great idea left imprints on his inner being\\". Jayaprakash took the Maulana's words to heart and left Patna College with just 20 days remaining for his examinations. Jayaprakash joined the Bihar Vidyapeeth, a college founded by Dr. Rajendra Prasad and became among the first students of Gandhian Dr. Anugraha Narayan Sinha.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter exhausting the courses at the Vidyapeeth, Jayaprakash decided to continue studies in the United States.[8]\\r\\nAt age 20, Jayaprakash sailed aboard the cargo ship Janus while Prabhavati remained at Sabarmati. Jayaprakash reached California on 8 October 1922 and was admitted to Berkeley in January 1923.[10] To pay for his education, Jayaprakash picked grapes, set them out to dry, packed fruits at a canning factory, washed dishes, worked as a mechanic at a garage and at a slaughter house, sold lotions and taught.[citation needed] All these jobs gave Jayaprakash an insight into the difficulties of the working class. After a semester studying chemistry[11] at UC Berkeley, Jayaprakash was forced to transfer to The University of Iowa when fees at Berkeley were doubled. He was forced to transfer to many universities thereafter. He pursued his favourite subject, sociology, and received much help from Professor Edward Ross.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wisconsin, Jayaprakash was introduced to Karl Marx's Das Kapital. News of the success of the Russian revolution of 1917 made Jayaprakash conclude that Marxism was the way to alleviate the suffering of the masses. He delved into books by Indian intellectual and Communist theoretician M. N. Roy. His paper on sociology, \\"Social Variation\\", was declared the best of the year.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan returned from the US to India in late 1929 as a Marxist.[12] He joined the Indian National Congress on the invitation of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1929; Mahatma Gandhi became his mentor in the Congress. He shared a house at Kadam Kuan in Patna with his close friend and nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha).[13] with whom he shared the most cordial and lasting friendship.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nHe won particular fame during the Quit India movement.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being jailed in 1932 for civil disobedience against British rule, Narayan was imprisoned in Nasik Jail, where he met Ram Manohar Lohia, Minoo Masani, Achyut Patwardhan, Ashok Mehta, Basawon Singh (Sinha), Yusuf Desai, C K Narayanaswami and other national leaders. After his release, the Congress Socialist Party, or (CSP), a left-wing group within the Congress, was formed with Acharya Narendra Deva as President and Narayan as General secretary.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, Yogendra Shukla scaled the wall of Hazaribagh Central Jail along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulab Chand Gupta, Pandit Ramnandan Mishra, Shaligram Singh and Shyam Barthwar, with a goal to start an underground movement for freedom.[14] Many young socialist leaders like Dr Ram Manohar Lohia, Chhotubhai Puranik, Aruna Asaf Ali, etc. took part in underground movement. As Jayaprakash Narayan was ill, Yogendra Shukla walked to Gaya with Jayaprakash Narayan on his shoulders,[14] a distance of about 124 kilometres.[15] He also served as the[16] Chairman of Anugrah Smarak Nidhi (Anugrah Narayan Memorial Fund).\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 1947 and 1953, Jayaprakash Narayan was President of All India Railwaymen's Federation, the largest labour union in the Indian Railways.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan returned to prominence in State politics in the late 1960s. 1974 ushered in a year of high inflation, unemployment and lack of supplies and essential commodities. Nav Nirman Andolan movement of Gujarat asked Jayaprakash to lead a peaceful agitation. Following Jayaprakash Narayan's call for social justice, and a demand for dissolution of the Bihar assembly. The Bihar government used brutal force to suppress the movement and on 18 March 1974, police fired on unarmed demonstrators and eight people were killed in police firing. On 8 April 1974, aged 72, he led a silent procession at Patna. The procession was lathi charged. On 5 June 1974, Jayaprakash addressed a large crowd at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. He declared, \\"This is a revolution, friends! We are not here merely to see the Vidhan Sabha dissolved. That is only one milestone on our journey. But we have a long way to go... After 27 years of freedom, people of this country are wracked by hunger, rising prices, corruption... oppressed by every kind of injustice... it is a Total Revolution we want, nothing less!\\" In 1974, he led the students' movement in the state of Bihar which gradually developed into a popular people's movement known as the Bihar Movement. It was during this movement that JP gave a call for peaceful Total Revolution.  Together with V. M. Tarkunde, he found the Citizens for Democracy in 1974 and the People's Union for Civil Liberties in 1976, both NGOs, to uphold and defend civil liberties.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndira was found guilty of violating electoral laws by the Allahabad High Court. Narayan called for Indira and the CMs to resign and the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders. He advocated a program of social transformation which he termed Sampoorna kraanti, \\"total revolution\\". Immediately afterwords, Gandhi proclaimed a national Emergency on the midnight of 25 June 1975. Desai, opposition leaders, and dissenting members of his own party were arrested that day.\\r\\n\\r\\nJayaprakash Narayan attracted a gathering of 100,000 people at the Ramlila grounds and thunderously recited Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar''s wonderfully evocative poetry: Singhasan Khaali Karo Ke Janata Aaati Hai.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan was kept as detenu at Chandigarh even after he asked for one month parole to mobilise relief in flooded parts of Bihar. His health suddenly deteriorated on 24 October, and he was released on 12 November; diagnosis at Jaslok Hospital, Bombay, revealed kidney failure; he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UK, Surur Hoda launched the \\"Free JP\\" campaign chaired by Nobel Peace Prize winner Noel-Baker for the release of Jayaprakash Narayan.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndira Gandhi revoked the emergency on 18 January 1977 and announced elections. The Janata Party, a vehicle for the broad spectrum of the opposition to Indira Gandhi, was formed under JP's guidance.[citation needed] The Janata Party was voted into power and became the first non-Congress party to form a government at the Centre.[citation needed] On the call of Narayan, many youngsters joined the JP movement.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNarayan died in Patna, Bihar,[20] on 8 October 1979, three days before his 77th birthday, due to effects of diabetes and heart ailments. In March 1979, while he was in hospital, his death had been erroneously announced by the Indian prime minister, Morarji Desai, causing a grief wave of national mourning, including the suspension of parliament and regular radio broadcasting, and the closure of schools and shops. When he was told about the gaffe a few weeks later, he smiled.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 18, Jayaprakash was married to Prabhavati Devi, daughter of lawyer and nationalist Brij Kishore Prasad in October 1920. Prabhavati was very independent and on Gandhi's invitation, went to stay at his ashram while Jayaprakash continued his studies.[21] Prabhavati Devi died in 1973 after a long battle with cancer.","input":"Who wrote biography of lok nayak jayprakash narayan?"},{"output":"2 May 1951","context":"The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is a governmental agency in India under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation responsible for co-ordination of statistical activities in India, and evolving and maintaining statistical standards.

In Bolivia and Peru above 10,000?feet altitude, tubers exposed to the cold night air turned into chu?o;[8] when kept in permanently frozen underground storehouses, chu?o can be stored for years with no loss of nutritional value. The Spanish fed chu?o to the silver miners who produced vast wealth in the 16th century for the Spanish government.[2]\\r\\nPotato was the staple food of most Pre?Columbian Mapuches, \\"specially in the southern and coastal [Mapuche] territories where maize did not reach maturity\\".[9]\\r\\nSailors returning from the Andes to Spain with silver presumably brought maize and potatoes for their own food on the trip.[10] Historians speculate that leftover tubers (and maize) were carried ashore and planted: \\"We think that the potato arrived some years before the end of the 16th century, by two different ports of entry: the first, logically, in Spain around 1570, and the second via the British Isles between 1588 and 1593 ... we find traces of the transport of potatoes travelling from the Canaries to Antwerp in 1567 ... we can say that the potato was introduced there [the Canary islands] from South America around 1562 ... the first written mention of the potato [is] ... a receipt for delivery dated 28 November 1567 between Las Palmas in the Grand Canaries and Antwerp.\\"[11] In 1553, in the book Cr܇nica del Peru, Pedro Cieza de Le܇n mentions he saw it in Quito, Popayn and Pasto in 1538. Basque fishermen from Spain used potatoes as ships' stores for their voyages across the Atlantic in the 16th century, and introduced the tuber to western Ireland, where they landed to dry their cod. The English privateer Sir Francis Drake, returning from his circumnavigation, or Sir Walter Raleigh's employee Thomas Harriot[12] are commonly credited with introducing potatoes into England. In 1588, botanist Carolus Clusius made a painting of what he called \\"Papas Peruanorum\\" from a specimen in the Low Countries; in 1601 he reported that potatoes were in common use in northern Italy for animal fodder and for human consumption.[13]\\r\\nThe Spanish had an empire across Europe, and brought potatoes for their armies. Peasants along the way adopted the crop, which was less often pillaged by marauding armies than above-ground stores of grain. Across most of Northern Europe, where open fields prevailed, potatoes were strictly confined to small garden plots because field agriculture was strictly governed by custom that prescribed seasonal rhythms for plowing, sowing, harvesting and grazing animals on fallow and stubble. This meant that potatoes were barred from large-scale cultivation because the rules allowed only grain to be planted in the open fields.[14] In France and Germany government officials and noble landowners promoted the rapid conversion of fallow land into potato fields after 1750. The potato thus became an important staple crop in northern Europe. Famines in the early 1770s contributed to its acceptance, as did government policies in several European countries and climate change during the Little Ice Age, when traditional crops in this region did not produce as reliably as before.[15][16] At times and places when and where most other crops failed, potatoes could still typically be relied upon to contribute adequately to food supplies during colder years.[17]\\r\\nIn France, at the end of the 16th century, the potato had been introduced to the Franche-Comt, the Vosges of Lorraine and Alsace. By the end of the 18th century it was written in the 1785 edition of Bon Jardinier: \\"There is no vegetable about which so much has been written and so much enthusiasm has been shown ... The poor should be quite content with this foodstuff.\\"[18] It had widely replaced the turnip and rutabaga by the 19th century.[19]\\r\\nFrench physician Antoine Parmentier studied the potato intensely and in Examen chymique des pommes de terres (\\"Chemical examination of potatoes\\") (Paris, 1774) showed their enormous nutritional value. King Louis XVI and his court eagerly promoted the new crop, with Queen Marie Antoinette even wearing a headdress of potato flowers at a fancy dress ball. The annual potato crop of France soared to 21?million hectoliters[clarification needed] in 1815 and 117?million in 1840, allowing a concomitant growth in population while avoiding the Malthusian trap. Although potatoes had become widely familiar in Russia by 1800, they were confined to garden plots until the grain failure in 1838ÿ39 persuaded peasants and landlords in central and northern Russia to devote their fallow fields to raising potatoes. Potatoes yielded from two to four times more calories per acre than grain did, and eventually came to dominate the food supply in Eastern Europe. Boiled or baked potatoes were cheaper than rye bread, just as nutritious, and did not require a gristmill for grinding. On the other hand, cash-oriented landlords realised that grain was much easier to ship, store and sell, so both grain and potatoes coexisted.[20]\\r\\nThroughout Europe, the most important new food in the 19th century was the potato, which had three major advantages over other foods for the consumer: its lower rate of spoilage, its bulk (which easily satisfied hunger) and its cheapness. The crop slowly spread across Europe, such that, for example, by 1845 it occupied one-third of Irish arable land.[citation needed] Potatoes comprised about 10% of the caloric intake of Europeans.[citation needed] Along with several other foods that either originated in the Americas or were successfully grown or harvested there, potatoes sustained European populations.[21]\\r\\nIn Britain, the potato promoted economic development by underpinning the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century. It served as a cheap source of calories and nutrients that was easy for urban workers to cultivate on small backyard plots. Potatoes became popular in the north of England, where coal was readily available, so a potato-driven population boom provided ample workers for the new factories. Marxist Friedrich Engels even declared that the potato was the equal of iron for its \\"historically revolutionary role\\".[13] The Dutch potato-starch industry grew rapidly in the 19th century, especially under the leadership of entrepreneur Willem Albert Scholten (1819ÿ92).[22]\\r\\nIn Ireland, the expansion of potato cultivation was due entirely to the landless labourers, renting tiny plots from landowners who were interested only in raising cattle or in producing grain for market. A single acre of potatoes and the milk of a single cow was enough to feed a whole Irish family a monotonous but nutritionally adequate diet for a healthy, vigorous (and desperately poor) rural population. Often even poor families grew enough extra potatoes to feed a pig that they could sell for cash.[23]\\r\\nA lack of genetic diversity from the low number of varieties left the crop vulnerable to disease. In the early 1800s, a strain of potato blight (Phytophthora infestans) known as HERB-1 began to spread in the Americas, especially Central and North America destroying many crops. The blight spread to Europe in the 1840s where, because of an extreme lack of genetic diversity, the potato crops were even more susceptible. In Northern Europe there were major crop losses lasting throughout the rest of the 19th century. Ireland in particular, because of the extreme dependence of the poor, especially western Ireland, on this single staple crop, was devastated by the blight's arrival in 1845.[24][25]\\r\\nThe Lumper potato, widely cultivated in western and southern Ireland before and during the Great Famine, was bland, wet and poorly resistant to the potato blight, but yielded large crops and usually provided adequate calories for peasants and labourers. Heavy dependence on this potato led to disaster when the blight quickly turned harvest-ready and newly harvested potatoes into a putrid mush. The Irish Famine in the western and southern parts of Ireland between 1845ÿ49 was a catastrophic failure in the food supply that led to approximately a million deaths from famine and (especially) diseases that attacked weakened bodies, and to massive emigration to Britain, the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.[26] During the famine years roughly one million Irish emigrated; this tide was not turned until the 20th century, when Ireland's population stood at less than half of the pre-famine level of 8 million.\\r\\nIt is generally believed that potatoes entered Africa with colonists, who consumed them as a vegetable rather than as a staple starch.[27] Shipping records from 1567 show that the first place outside of Central and South America where potatoes were grown were the Canary Islands.[28] As in other continents, despite its advantages as an anti-famine, high-elevation alternative to grain, potatoes were first resisted by local farmers who believed they were poisonous. Colonialists also promoted them as a low cost food and so it was a symbol of domination. In former European colonies of Africa, potatoes were initially consumed only occasionally, but increased production made them a staple in certain areas. Potatoes tended to become more popular in wartime due to their being able to be stored in the ground. It was well established as a crop by the mid-20th century [16] and in present-day Africa they have become a vegetable or co-staple crop.[27]\\r\\nIn higher regions of Rwanda, potatoes have become a new staple food crop. Prior to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, consumption was as high as 153 to 200?kg per year ÿ higher than in any Western European country. Recently farmers have developed the potato as a cash crop after introducing several new varieties brought back by migrant laborers from Uganda and other varieties from Kenya.[27]\\r\\nThe potato diffused widely after 1600, becoming a major food resource in Europe and East Asia. Following its introduction into China toward the end of the Ming dynasty, the potato immediately became a delicacy of the imperial family. After the middle period of the Qianlong era (1735ÿ96) in the Qing dynasty, population increases and a subsequent need to increase grain yields coupled with greater peasant geographic mobility led to the rapid spread of potato cultivation throughout China, and it was acclimated to local natural conditions.\\r\\nBoomgaard (2003) looks at the adoption of various root and tuber crops in Indonesia throughout the colonial period and examines the chronology and reasons for progressive adoption of foreign crops: sweet potato, Irish potato, bengkuang (yam beans), and cassava.\\r\\nEdward Terry mentioned the potato in his travel accounts of the banquet at Ajmer by Asaph Khan to Sir Thomas Roe, the British Ambassador in 1675. It is the earliest mention in history of India[clarification needed]. The vegetables gardens of Surat and Karnataka had potatoes as mentioned in Fyer's travel record of 1675. The Portuguese introduced potatoes, which they called 'Batata', to India in the early seventeenth century when they cultivated it along the western coast. British traders introduced potatoes to Bengal as a root crop, 'Alu'. By the end of the 18th century, it was cultivated across northern hill areas of India.[16] Potatoes were introduced to Tibet by the 19th century through trade route from India.[29]\\r\\nThe potato was introduced to the Philippines during the late 16th century, and to Java and China during the 17th century.[citation needed]\\r\\nPotatoes were planted in Idaho as early as 1838; by 1900 the state's production exceeded a million bushels (about 27,000?tonnes[31]). Prior to 1910, the crops were stored in barns or root cellars, but, by the 1920s, potato cellars or barns came into use. U.S. potato production has increased steadily; two-thirds of the crop comes from Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Colorado, and Maine, and potato growers have strengthened their position in both domestic and foreign markets.\\r\\nBy the 1960s, the Canadian Potato Research Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick, was one of the top six potato research institutes in the world. Established in 1912 as a Dominion Experimental Station, the station began in the 1930s to concentrate on breeding new varieties of disease-resistant potatoes. In the 1950sÿ1960s, the growth of the French fry industry in New Brunswick led to a focus on developing varieties for the industry. By the 1970s, the station's potato research was broader than ever before, but the station and its research programs had changed, as emphasis was placed on serving industry rather than potato farmers in general. Scientists at the station even began describing their work using engineering language rather than scientific prose.[32] Potatoes are Canada's most important vegetable crop; they are grown commercially in all its provinces, led by Prince Edward Island.[33] In modern days potatoes have grown in popularity due to their versatility and ability to be used for many different dishes of food.\\r\\nThe first potatoes to arrive in North America from Europe were sent to Gov.

Originally set for a December 2012 release, the production suffered some setbacks. In June 2012, the film's release date was pushed back, and the crew returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting.

The film received positive reviews for Brad Pitt's performance and as a realistic revival of the zombie genre, but received certain criticism for the anti-climax and outdated CGI. Regardless, the film was a commercial success, grossing over $540 million against a production budget of $190 million, becoming the highest-grossing zombie film of all time. A sequel was announced shortly after the film's release, and is currently in production.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer UN employee Gerry Lane, his wife Karin and their two daughters are in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is overrun by zombies that are attracted to sound. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to Newark, New Jersey and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. UN Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni, an old friend of Gerry's, sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreak's source after it is made clear that he and his family will be removed from the ship if he does not.\\r\\nGerry and Fassbach fly to Camp Humphreys, a military base in South Korea, where they are attacked on arrival by zombies. Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally discharges his gun, killing himself. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg whom the infected ignored. A former CIA operative imprisoned at the base for selling weapons to North Korea (to help them fight the infection) tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where he says a safe zone has been maintained by the Israeli Mossad since before the outbreak's official acknowledgement. As Gerry and his team bike back to their aircraft, zombies attack, kill several soldiers and infect Captain Speke, who commits suicide to prevent himself from turning. Gerry and his pilot escape.\\r\\nIn Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that months earlier, the Mossad had intercepted an Indian military message claiming that Indian troops were fighting the rakshasa, or \\"dead spirits\\". Israel had thereupon quarantined Jerusalem, erecting huge walls around it. Just as Jurgen shows Gerry that Israel is allowing survivors to take refuge in the city, loud celebratory singing from refugees prompts zombies to scale the walls and attack. Jurgen orders some Israeli soldiers to escort Gerry back to his plane. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an old man and an emaciated boy. Soon after, one of Gerry's escorts, a soldier who identifies herself only as \\"Segen\\", is bitten in the hand, which Gerry quickly amputates to stop her turning. Gerry and Segen escape on a commercial airliner as Jerusalem is overrun, and Israel seeks to protect its remaining borders.\\r\\nGerry contacts Thierry, and the airliner is diverted to a World Health Organization (WHO) facility outside Cardiff, Wales. When a stowaway zombie attacks in mid-air, Gerry uses a grenade to blow the infected out of the aircraft, but this also causes them to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff a theory he has, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting somebody with a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.\\r\\nGerry and his family are reunited in a safe zone at Freeport, Nova Scotia. A \\"vaccine\\", derived from deadly pathogens, is developed and issued to survivors battling the infected, acting as a kind of camouflage. The vaccine also helps survivors to reach quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. \\"This isn't the end,\\" Gerry comments, \\"Not even close. Our war has just begun.\\"\\r\\n Screewriter Damon Lindelof on developing the film[8]\\r\\nAfter a bidding war with Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way, Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment secured the screen rights to the novel in 2007.[9] The first screenplay was written by Babylon 5 and Rising Stars creator J. Michael Straczynski, who identified the challenge in adapting the work as \\"creating a main character out of a book that reads as a UN report on the zombie wars.\\"[10] Marc Forster signed on to direct, and described the film as reminiscent of 1970s conspiracy thrillers like All the President's Men.[11] Straczynski identified 2002 spy film The Bourne Identity as an appropriate comparison, and noted that the film would have a large international scope which maintained the political emphasis.[12] When asked about his involvement with the film, author Max Brooks stated that he had \\"zero control\\", but favored a role for Brad Pitt,[13] and expressed approval for Straczynski as screenwriter.[14][15] Brooks said: \\"I can't give it away, but Straczynski found a way to tie it all together. The last draft I read was amazing.\\"[16]\\r\\nAn early script was leaked onto the internet in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it \\"[not] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [but] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing about whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material\\".[17] The script was well-enough respected to find a place on the 2007 Black List of \\"most liked\\" screenplays not yet produced.[18] The Ain't It Cool News review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men, following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are \\"starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind.\\"[17] Straczynski had hoped that the film would begin production by the start of 2009.[12] In March 2009, Forster said that the script was still in development and he was not sure if World War Z would be his next film.[19] Later in March, rumors surfaced that production offices were set up and the film was in early pre-production.[20] In June 2009, Marc Forster told an interviewer that the film would be delayed, stating that the film's script still needs a lot of development and is \\"still far from realization\\".[21]\\r\\nIn July 2009, Brooks revealed that the script was being re-written by Matthew Michael Carnahan. Brooks believed that this \\"show[ed] [the producer's] confidence in this project\\" because of the amount of money that was being invested in it.[22] Paramount Pictures and UTV Motion Pictures announced at the 2010 Comic-Con that Forster was set as director, and Brad Pitt was confirmed to play the lead role.[23] In March 2011, it was reported that Paramount was searching for co-financier, and would likely pull the plug on the adaptation without one.[24] The article also stated that \\"an eleventh-hour effort is being made to court frequent Paramount co-financier David Ellison.\\" A week later, it was reported that \\"hot and heavy talks are going on with David Ellison's Skydance and as many as two other financiers.\\"[25]\\r\\nPre-production began in April 2011 with Robert Richardson announced as the cinematographer.[26] In the same month it was reported that filming locations would include Pinewood Studios and London, England.[27] Also in April, Mireille Enos was cast as Gerry Lane's wife and mother of their two children.[28] In June 2011, James Badge Dale entered negotiations to join the film as an American soldier who tries to alert authorities that the zombie threat is real.[29] It was also reported that filming would begin in Malta in July 2011 and would encompass Valletta and The Three Cities.[30] A few days later Matthew Fox and Ed Harris entered talks while Julia Levy-Boeken was set to join the film.[31] It was also reported that filming would also take place in Glasgow, Scotland in August 2011.[32] Glasgow would double as Philadelphia, \\"with false shop fronts being constructed and American cars on the roads.\\"[33] The city was reportedly chosen after \\"many months looking for the perfect city centre location to play an important part in the film.\\"[32] Philadelphia was passed on due to \\"uncertainties about state tax credits for filmmakers.\\"[34] Filming was originally planned to take place in Royal Tunbridge Wells, England before moving to Glasgow.[35] Later in June, visual effects house Cinesite announced that it would work on \\"a significant amount of shots\\".[36] At the end of the month it was reported that neither Matthew Fox nor Ed Harris would be starring in the film despite previous reports: Fox had a scheduling conflict stemming from his prior commitment to star in Alex Cross with Tyler Perry at Summit Entertainment.[37] Fox was later spotted, filming scenes in Falmouth, Cornwall.[38]\\r\\nOn a budget of $125 million,[24] World War Z began principal photography in July 2011 in Malta, with the first images of production being released a few days later.[39] Filming was scheduled to move to Glasgow, Scotland in August with the production company looking to recruit 2,000 local extras for the shoot.[40] At least 3,000 people showed up at a casting call in Glasgow on July 9, hoping for the opportunity to appear in a scene set in a financial district in Philadelphia.[41] Scenes were also shot in Falmouth, Cornwall.[42] Also in July 2011, Game of Thrones actor Elyes Gabel was cast as a character named Fassbach.[43]\\r\\nIn August 2011, Bryan Cranston entered negotiations to join the film in a \\"small but flashy\\" role but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. Also in August, filming was set to take place along a road on the perimeter of the Grangemouth Refinery in Grangemouth, Scotland. The location was chosen for the length of the road which is crucial to the shot.[44] A few days later Paramount announced the film would be released on December 21, 2012.[45] Later in the same month, filming began in Glasgow. The location manager for the film said Glasgow had been chosen because of its architecture, wide roads, and grid layout.[46] Scenes were also filmed aboard the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship RFA Argus, before the Glasgow shoot. The ship was turned into the \\"USS Madison\\", which involved stenciling a new pennant number on to the funnel, as well as adding some \\"Americanism\\" to the superstructure. Steven McMenemy, the Argus's navigator said, \\"The ship sailed and we were joined by four small catamarans which were being used as markers for the cameras, so that warships could be added in with CGI later.\\"[47] In October 2011, David Morse was cast as a \\"prisoner living in an abandoned jail.\\"[48]\\r\\nThe filmmakers initially intended to film a climactic battle scene set in Russia, and the crew moved to Budapest to film it there.[49] Filming in Budapest commenced on the evening of October 10, 2011.[50] That morning, the Hungarian Counter Terrorism Centre raided the warehouse where guns had been delivered for use as filming props.[50] The 85 assault rifles, sniper rifles, and handguns had been flown into Budapest overnight on a private aircraft, but the film's producers had failed to clear the delivery with Hungarian authorities, and while the import documentation indicated that the weapons had been disabled, all were found to be fully functional.[50][51] On February 10, 2012, the charges were dropped after investigators were unable to identify exactly which \\"organization or person\\" had \\"ownership rights\\"; therefore they could not \\"establish which party was criminally liable\\".[52]\\r\\nIn May 2012, production returned to Budapest for seven weeks of additional shooting.[53] The following month, screenwriter Damon Lindelof was hired to rewrite the film's third act with reshoots scheduled to begin in September or October 2012.[54] However, Lindelof, who also reworked Prometheus and co-wrote Star Trek Into Darkness, did not have time to script the new ending and in July 2012, Paramount hired Lindelof's Lost partner, Drew Goddard.[55] Lindelof explained there were inefficiencies in the script in relation to the shooting, which started before the script was finalized thus making the ending \\"abrupt and incoherent\\" and was missing a large chunk of footage. Lindelof presented two options to executives, who ultimately chose to shoot 30 to 40 minutes of additional footage to make a coherent ending. Goddard later told Creative Screenwriting, \\"To me the big lesson of World War Z was that Paramount, Plan B and Brad Pitt simply said, 'Let's take the time to make this movie the best version of the movie before we put it on the screen for audience.' That doesn't happen a lot. A lot of times they just throw the movie out there and say, 'We'll make all our money opening weekend and then the movie will go away.' I came away from it thinking, 'Why don't we do this on more movies?'\\"[56]\\r\\nThe re-shoots coupled with other overages caused the budget to balloon to around $190 million, which shocked Paramount president Marc Evans.[4][5][57] Several of the scenes shot in Budapest, including a large-scale battle with the zombies in Moscow's Red Square,[58] were dropped from the final cut in order to water down the film's political undertones, and steer it towards a more generally friendly summer blockbuster.[59] The climactic battle scene in Russia, for which there was 12 minutes of footage, had Pitt's character fighting through zombies more like \\"a warrior hero\\" than \\"the sympathetic family man\\" of the earlier acts. The second-unit director, Simon Crane, said, \\"It wasn't character-driven anymore... [The filmmakers] really needed to think about what they wanted to do with the third act.\\"[49] Additional scenes were also filmed at the Pfizer building at Discovery Park in Sandwich, Kent for scenes where Gerry tries to find a cure for the zombie pandemic.[60]\\r\\nIn March 2013, it was reported that Paramount changed a scene in the film in which the characters speculate that the zombie outbreak originated in mainland China in hopes of landing a distribution deal in the country.[61] An executive familiar with upcoming releases in China later told The Wrap in June 2013 that a cut of the film was rejected by Chinese censors. A Paramount executive contended that he was \\"unaware of any rejection\\", explaining, \\"We have submitted one version and have yet to receive a response.\\"[62]\\r\\nIn December 2011, it was reported that Marco Beltrami had signed on to score World War Z.[63] In May 2013, the British rock band Muse posted a video on their YouTube channel, hinting that they would be contributing to the soundtrack of World War Z; the instrumental-dubstep versions of the songs \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\" and \\"Follow Me\\" (produced by the electronic band Nero )[64][65] were used.[66] In June, Warner Bros. Records released the soundtrack album for the film, which featured the original score composed by Beltrami.[67]\\r\\nWorld War Z was initially scheduled for release by Paramount and Skydance on December 21, 2012, but in March 2012 it was pushed back to June 21, 2013. Paramount elected to release Jack Reacher on the December 2012 date.[45][68] The world premiere of World War Z was held at the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square, London on June 2, 2013.[69] British rock band Muse, who contributed toward the film's soundtrack, performed at the World War Z post-premiere concert at the Horse Guards Parade, to help promote the film.[70] On June 6, Pitt attended screenings of the film in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago and Austin all in one day.[71] The film was chosen to open the 35th Moscow International Film Festival.[72] World War Z was released exclusively to Glasgow's Grosvenor Cinema in Ashton Lane on June 19, two days before it was launched worldwide.[73]\\r\\nWorld War Z grossed $202.4 million in North America, and $337.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $540 million.[6] Variety called it a bona-fide box office hit.[74]\\r\\nIn North America, World War Z earned $25.20 million on its opening Friday,[75] including $3.6 million from Thursday night and midnight shows.[76] It went on to finish in second place behind Monsters University during its opening weekend with $66.41 million.[77] This was the second-largest opening weekend for a film that did not debut in first place (behind The Day After Tomorrow),[78] the largest opening weekend for a film starring Brad Pitt[77] and the sixth-largest opening among films released in June.[79]\\r\\nIn other territories, the film earned $5.7 million on its opening day (Thursday, June 20, 2013)[76] and $45.8 million on its opening weekend, ranking in third place.[77]\\r\\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, World War Z has a 66% approval rating, based on 264 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"It's uneven and diverges from the source book, but World War Z still brings smart, fast-moving thrills and a solid performance from Brad Pitt to the zombie genre.\\"[80] Metacritic, which uses a weighted mean, assigned a score of 63 out of 100, based on reviews from 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".[81]\\r\\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a 3.5 out of 4, saying \\"It's entertaining as hell\\" and it provides \\"nearly non-stop action\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that \\"the suspense is killer\\". Henry Barnes of The Guardian considered World War Z an \\"attempt at large-scale seriousness\\" in the zombie genre, which resulted in a \\"punchy, if conventional action thriller.\\"[82] Writing for Variety, Scott Foundas thought the film to be a \\"surprisingly smart, gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie-movie canon\\", which shows \\"few visible signs of the massive rewrites, reshoots and other post-production patchwork.\\"[83] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter opined that \\"Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising.\\"[84] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, \\"[It] does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them.\\"[85] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times remarked, \\"World War Z plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable, but unless you knew about the film's troubled past, you'd never guess it existed.\\"[86]\\r\\nConversely, Joe Neumaier of The New York Daily News said that World War Z \\"is no summer thriller. It's an anemic actioner that fosters excitement like dead limbs as it lumbers toward a conclusion.\\"[87] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph thought that the film had been affected by its troubled development, observing that \\"the final product has an elaborate uselessness about it\\", in a film that has \\"no heart to be found amid the guts.\\"[88] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap said, \\"For all its effectiveness at portraying the horror of possible human extinction, the film's actual humans are so soulless that this could just as well be the movie version of the video game Plants vs. Zombies.\\"[89]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film was released on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on September 17, 2013. The Blu-ray disc contains an unrated cut.[92] It adds seven minutes of additional footage featuring moderate amounts of blood, gore and violence. Some scenes already present in the theatrical cut are also extended.\\r\\nA video game tie-in survival horror game, World War Z, was developed by Phosphor Games Studio and released for the iOS mobile platforms in May 2013. The game is a spin-off of the film, being set in Denver, Kyoto, and Paris, and featuring an entirely different set of characters.[93]\\r\\nIn December 2017, Saber Interactive and Paramount announced they were developing a four-player video game to be released in 2018 for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. The game will include missions set around the world.[94][95]\\r\\nIn January 2012, director Forster and Paramount said that \\"They each view World War Z as a trilogy that would have the grounded, gun-metal realism of Matt Damon's Jason Bourne series tethered to the unsettling end-times vibe of AMC's The Walking Dead\\".[96] Plans for future installments were shelved due to the film's production troubles.[97]\\r\\nIn June 2013, after the successful opening of World War Z, Paramount announced that it was moving ahead with a sequel.[97] In December 2013, it was reported that Juan Antonio Bayona had been chosen to direct the film.[98] In May 2014, Steven Knight was set to write the script.[99] In May 2015, it was announced that the film would be released on June 9, 2017,[100] but in January 2016, Paramount announced that director Bayona left the project due to other commitments.[101] In August 2016, Variety reported that the film was not yet in production and that David Fincher had entered negotiations to be the director, and in April 2017 it was reported Fincher was close to a deal to sign on.[102][103] On February 8, 2017, Paramount announced that the sequel has still not started filming and would not be released until 2018 or possibly even 2019.[104] In June 2017, David Fincher was confirmed by Paramount as the director of the sequel, with Brad Pitt returning to his role.[105] Filming was slated to start in fall of 2018.[106] In April 2018, it is revealed that filming will not begin in 2018 as Fincher focuses on his TV-series Mindhunter.[107]","input":"What was brad pitt in world war z?"},{"output":"the busing of students to promote integration in public schools","context":"Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971) was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools.[1] The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools, even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race. This was done to ensure the schools would be \\"properly\\" integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race.\\r\\nJudge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, like many in the South, interpreted Brown as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate. In 1963, the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration, and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation. In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation, thus it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools. In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education (1969), Judge Frank Johnsons desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth Carolina was one of the more moderate Southern states, and its resistance to integration was much weaker than in most other areas of the South. After Brown, it had ended segregation with a school assignment plan based on neighborhoods that was approved by the Court. However, when Charlotte consolidated school districts from the city itself with a surrounding area totaling 550 square miles (1,400?km2), the majority of black students (who lived in central Charlotte) still attended mostly black schools as compared with majority white schools further outside the city.\\r\\nThe NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought the Swann case on behalf of six-year-old James Swann and nine other families, with Julius L. Chambers presenting the case. Swann was chosen because his father was a theology professor, and was thus unlikely to be economically burdened by local retaliation.\\r\\nIn 1965, Judge J. Braxton Craven decided Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education in favor of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, because there was no requirement in the Constitution to act purposely to increase racial mixing.\\r\\nAfter the Green ruling, the Swann case was filed again, and this time taken by Judge James B. McMillan as his first important case on the federal bench. McMillan had at one point been a public opponent of busing to integrate schools, but when the case was presented to him he said that the facts outweighed his feelings, and busing was the only way to fulfill the constitutional requirement of desegregation.\\r\\nExperts from Rhode Island College were brought in for the Plaintiff's side to judge the effectiveness of the school board's new plan. From April to November 1969, McMillan repeatedly ordered the board to revise the plan. The Board eventually submitted a plan rezoning neighborhoods into pie-shaped wedges, where blacks living in the center of Charlotte would be divided up and distributed to outlying, formerly white high schools. The school board's plan required busing and would achieve a black population of 2-36% in all ten of the high schools. Due to the greater number of elementary schools, elaborate gerrymandering was required and would achieve greater integration, but would leave more than half of black elementary students at majority-black schools.\\r\\nThe Court rejected the Board's plan in favor of outsider Dr. John Finger's plan. The Finger Plan required busing of an additional 300 black students, established \\"satellite zones\\" and required pairing and grouping techniques to achieve even greater integration. As a consequence, McMillan became a local pariah.[2] Chambers' home, office and car were bombed when he first took up the case.[3]\\r\\nWhen the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the case was heard en banc by six of the seven judges sat on the court. The seventh judge Judge J. Braxton Craven, recused himself due to him being the original trial court judge. The opinion was 3-2-1 that the restructured busing orders should be affirmed for older students, but that it be remanded for those of elementary school age. Two dissenters would have affirmed the whole decision, while one would reverse McMillans ruling in its entirety. McMillan decided to follow his original plan for elementary school students after the case was remanded to him.\\r\\nJustice Douglas had previously been strongly opposed to busing. The Court was urged to begin their term early to hear the case, but decided to wait until the first day of their new term to begin.\\r\\nDespite his relative youth and inexperience, Julius Chambers argued the case, because of his intimate knowledge of the facts involved. Erwin Griswold, the Solicitor General of the United States, represented the federal government, advocating Nixons go-slow policy. Though no official vote was taken, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Black wanted to reverse McMillans order, while Justices Douglas, Harlan, Brennan and Marshall wanted a strong affirmation of the order; Justices Stewart, White and Blackmun did not express a strong feeling either way. Douglas, Brennan and Marshall were quite liberal, but Harlan was usually conservative. When Burger circulated his very grudging affirmation of McMillan that limited future action and action in other areas by the Court, he met strong resistance. Douglas, Harlan, Brennan and Marshall all demanded revisions and circulated suggestions for alternate drafts. Justice Stewart also reacted strongly after carefully considering the facts of the case, and wrote a dissent that would have been the opinion of the court without revisions of Burgers drafts.\\r\\nBurger revised the opinion five times, each time making a stronger affirmation of McMillan and incorporating the language of Harlan, Brennan, Stewart and others into it. After the fifth draft, Justice Black threatened a dissent if the opinion was made any stronger an affirmation, and so a sixth and final draft was created that was close to what Justice Stewart had composed after the first conference. The final opinion was 9-0 affirming McMillans order.\\r\\nThe decision led to the widespread use of busing to end segregation by federal judges in the South.\\r\\nWhen the courts mandated that busing should occur to desegregate the schools, they also noted that one day when the school system was thought to be unitary, busing would end and the school board would be able to come up with a new plan which would best suit the education of students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg.\\r\\nAfter busing was enforced in 1971, throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, Charlotte was known across the nation as the city that made desegregation work. It paved the way for many different school systems to use the busing plan to force integration in the school systems.[4]\\r\\nHowever, due to the booming economy of the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Charlotte experienced a rapid immigration from the Northeast and the Midwest, which resulted in a decline of the acceptanced of busing. In 1992, in response to these complaints, CMS created a managed choice plan to reduce the number of students being bused. This new choice plan revolved around magnet schools, making one-third of the schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg either magnets or partial magnets, and each magnet had a quota of black and white students that were allowed to attend. But this didnt please many white families who were denied entrance into magnet schools that had fulfilled their quotas.\\r\\nIn 1997, a parent, William Capacchione, sued the school system when his daughter was denied entrance into a magnet school for the second time based on her race.[5] While the school system opposed the end of busing, Judge Robert D. Potter declared the mandate of a unitary system had been met and lifted the court order on mandatory busing by race or ethnicity. This ruling was upheld by the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia in 2000 and after the final appeal was declined to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal order of busing was ended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it was left in the hands of the city school board to decide how to redo the assignment policy for school attendance.[6]\\r\\nThe new assignment policy which was adopted in the fall of 2002 was known as the School Choice Plan. This new choice plan divided the city into four large attendance zones based on neighborhoods. Students were allowed to choose to stay at their neighborhood \\"home school,\\" or they could rank their top three choices of any other school in CMS; however they would only receive free transportation to their home school or any of the magnet schools in the district. If families chose their home school as their first choice, they were guaranteed that school; otherwise they were entered into a lottery that gave available spaces in overenrolled schools. If people did not choose a school, they were immediately placed into their home school. After creating a variety of programs to inform families about the new plan, over 95% of the families in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system submitted choices for the new school year.[4]","input":"(mc)what issue was debated in the swann v. charlotte-mecklenburg board of education case?"},{"output":"Roger Keyes","context":"","input":"Who was the overall british commander of the gallipoli campaign?"},{"output":"Deficits in cognitive abilities","context":"Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real.[2] Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation.[2][3] People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.[11] Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.[3][5]\\r\\nThe causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors.[4] Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, cannabis use during adolescence, certain infections, parental age and poor nutrition during pregnancy.[4][12] Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants.[13] Diagnosis is based on observed behavior, the person's reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person.[5] During diagnosis a person's culture must also be taken into account.[5] As of 2013 there is no objective test.[5] Schizophrenia does not imply a \\"split personality\\" or \\"dissociative identity disorder\\" ÿ conditions with which it is often confused in public perception.[14]\\r\\nThe mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, job training and social rehabilitation.[2][4] It is unclear whether typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.[15] In those who do not improve with other antipsychotics clozapine may be tried.[4] In more serious situations where there is risk to self or others involuntary hospitalization may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.[16]\\r\\nAbout 0.3ÿ0.7% of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetimes.[9] In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally.[17] Males are more often affected than females.[2] About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely.[5] Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common.[5][18] The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population.[7] This is the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%).[9][19] In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.[10]\\r\\nIndividuals with schizophrenia may experience hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), delusions (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech that is not understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.[20]\\r\\nDistortions of self-experience such as feeling as if one's thoughts or feelings are not really one's own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one's mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common.[21] There is often an observable pattern of emotional difficulty, for example lack of responsiveness.[22] Impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia,[23] as are symptoms of paranoia. Social isolation commonly occurs.[24] Difficulties in working and long-term memory, attention, executive functioning, and speed of processing also commonly occur.[9] In one uncommon subtype, the person may be largely mute, remain motionless in bizarre postures, or exhibit purposeless agitation, all signs of catatonia.[25] People with schizophrenia often find facial emotion perception to be difficult.[26] It is unclear if the phenomenon called \\"thought blocking\\", where a talking person suddenly becomes silent for a few seconds to minutes, occurs in schizophrenia.[27][28]\\r\\nAbout 30 to 50 percent of people with schizophrenia fail to accept that they have an illness or comply with their recommended treatment.[29] Treatment may have some effect on insight.[30]\\r\\nPeople with schizophrenia may have a high rate of irritable bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked.[31] Psychogenic polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.[32]\\r\\nSchizophrenia is often described in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms.[33] Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis.[34] Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme.[35] Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.[35]\\r\\nNegative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, and are less responsive to medication.[20] They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do.[36] People with greater negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.[20][37]\\r\\nDeficits in cognitive abilities are widely recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia.[38][39][40] The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment.[41] The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia has been reported to be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms.[38] The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas: working memory, long-term memory,[42][43] verbal declarative memory,[44] semantic processing,[45] episodic memory,[41] attention, learning (particularly verbal learning).[42] Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory.[42] When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words.[42] These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent.[38][40][46] First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit in cognitive abilities, and specifically in working memory.[46]?A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood.[38] The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.[38][42]\\r\\nAlthough the evidence that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant,[41][42] much of the research in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory.[42][43] Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance.[42] Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks.[42] This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.[42]\\r\\nLate adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia,[9] critical years in a young adult's social and vocational development.[47] In 40% of men and 23% of women diagnosed with schizophrenia, the condition manifested itself before the age of 19.[48] The onset of the disease is usually later in women than in men.[49] To minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia, much work has recently been done to identify and treat the prodromal (pre-onset) phase of the illness, which has been detected up to 30?months before the onset of symptoms.[47] Those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self-limiting psychotic symptoms[50] and the non-specific symptoms of social withdrawal, irritability, dysphoria,[51] and clumsiness before the onset of the disease.[52] Children who go on to develop schizophrenia may also demonstrate decreased intelligence, decreased motor development (reaching milestones such as walking slowly), isolated play preference, social anxiety, and poor school performance.[53][54][55]\\r\\nA combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia.[9][14] People with a family history of schizophrenia who have a transient psychosis have a 20ÿ40% chance of being diagnosed one year later.[56]\\r\\nEstimates of the heritability of schizophrenia is around 80%, which implies that 80% of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is explained by individual differences in genetics.[57] These estimates vary because of the difficulty in separating genetic and environmental influences.[58] The greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of monozygotic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected.[14] If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%.[57]\\r\\nMany genes are known to be involved in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression.[13][59] The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia.[60] Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11.[61] These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities.[61] There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.[62]\\r\\nEnvironmental factors associated with the development of schizophrenia include the living environment, drug use, and prenatal stressors.[9]\\r\\nMaternal stress has been associated with an increase risk of schizophrenia, possibly in association with reelin. Maternal Stress has been observed to lead to hypermethylation and therefore under-expression of reelin, which in animal models leads to reduction in GABAergic neurons, a common finding in schizophrenia.[63] Maternal nutritional deficiencies, such as those observed during a famine, as well as maternal obesity have also been identified as possible risk factors for schizophrenia. Both maternal stress and infection have been demonstrated to alter fetal neurodevelopment through pro-inflammatory proteins such as IL-8 and TNF.[64][65]\\r\\nParenting style seems to have no major effect, although people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents.[14] Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis.[66] Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two,[9][14] even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group.[67] Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.[14][68]\\r\\nIt has been hypothesized that in some people, development of schizophrenia is related to intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the intestinal flora.[69] A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to gluten different from that found in people with celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as anti-gliadin IgG or anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.[70]\\r\\nAbout half of those with schizophrenia use drugs or alcohol excessively.[71] Amphetamine, cocaine, and to a lesser extent alcohol, can result in a transient stimulant psychosis or alcohol-related psychosis that presents very similarly to schizophrenia.[14][72] Although it is not generally believed to be a cause of the illness, people with schizophrenia use nicotine at much higher rates than the general population.[73]\\r\\nAlcohol abuse can occasionally cause the development of a chronic, substance-induced psychotic disorder via a kindling mechanism.[74] Alcohol use is not associated with an earlier onset of psychosis.[75]\\r\\nCannabis can be a contributory factor in schizophrenia,[12][76][77] potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk.[77] The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual[77] or may be related to preexisting psychopathology.[12] Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk.[12] The size of the increased risk is not clear,[78] but appears to be in the range of two to three times greater for psychosis.[76] Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.[76]\\r\\nOther drugs may be used only as coping mechanisms by individuals who have schizophrenia, to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness.[71][79]\\r\\nFactors such as hypoxia and infection, or stress and malnutrition in the mother during fetal development, may result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life.[9] People diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring (at least in the northern hemisphere), which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposures in utero.[14] The increased risk is about five to eight percent.[80] Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that may increase the risk include Toxoplasma gondi and Chlamydia.[81]\\r\\nA number of attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia.[9] One of the most common is the dopamine hypothesis, which attributes psychosis to the mind's faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons.[9]\\r\\nMany psychological mechanisms have been implicated in the development and maintenance of schizophrenia. Cognitive biases have been identified in those with the diagnosis or those at risk, especially when under stress or in confusing situations.[82] Some cognitive features may reflect global neurocognitive deficits such as memory loss, while others may be related to particular issues and experiences.[83][84]\\r\\nDespite a demonstrated appearance of blunted affect, recent findings indicate that many individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia are emotionally responsive, particularly to stressful or negative stimuli, and that such sensitivity may cause vulnerability to symptoms or to the disorder.[85][86] Some evidence suggests that the content of delusional beliefs and psychotic experiences can reflect emotional causes of the disorder, and that how a person interprets such experiences can influence symptomatology.[87][88][89] The use of \\"safety behaviors\\" (acts such as gestures or the use of words in specific contexts) to avoid or neutralize imagined threats may actually contribute to the chronicity of delusions.[90] Further evidence for the role of psychological mechanisms comes from the effects of psychotherapies on symptoms of schizophrenia.[91]\\r\\nSchizophrenia is associated with subtle differences in brain structures, found in forty to fifty percent of cases, and in brain chemistry during acute psychotic states.[9] Studies using neuropsychological tests and brain imaging technologies such as fMRI and PET to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to occur most commonly in the frontal lobes, hippocampus and temporal lobes.[93] Reductions in brain volume are most pronounced in grey matter structures, and correlate with duration of illness, although white matter abnormalities have also been found. A progressive increase in ventricular volume as well as a progressive reduction in grey matter in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes has also been observed.[94][95] These differences have been linked to the neurocognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia.[96] Because neural circuits are altered, it has alternatively been suggested that schizophrenia could be thought of as a neurodevelopmental disorder with psychosis occurring as a possibly preventable late stage.[97] There has been debate on whether treatment with antipsychotics can itself cause reduction of brain volume.[98]\\r\\nParticular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that phenothiazine drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.[99] The influential dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia proposed that excessive activation of D2 receptors was the cause of (the positive symptoms of) schizophrenia. Although postulated for about 20?years based on the D2 blockade effect common to all antipsychotics, it was not until the mid-1990s that PET and SPET imaging studies provided supporting evidence. While dopamine D2/D3 receptors are elevated in schizophrenia, the effect size is small, and only evident in medication naive schizophrenics. On the other hand, presynaptic dopamine metabolism and released is elevated despite no difference in dopamine transporter.[100] The altered synthesis of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system have been confirmed in several human studies.[101][102] Hypoactivity of dopamine D1 receptor activation in the prefrontal cortex has also been observed.[103] The hyperactivity of D2 receptor stimulation and relative hypoactivity of D1 receptor stimulation is thought to contribute to cognitive dysfunction by disrupting signal to noise ratio in cortical microcircuits.[104] The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (atypical antipsychotic medication) can be just as effective as older medication (typical antipsychotic medication), but also affects serotonin function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.[105]\\r\\nInterest has also focused on the neurotransmitter glutamate and the reduced function of the NMDA glutamate receptor in schizophrenia, largely because of the abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in the postmortem brains of those diagnosed with schizophrenia,[106] and the discovery that glutamate-blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition.[107] Reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring frontal lobe and hippocampal function, and glutamate can affect dopamine function, both of which have been implicated in schizophrenia; this has suggested an important mediating (and possibly causal) role of glutamate pathways in the condition.[108] But positive symptoms fail to respond to glutamatergic medication.[109] Closely related to evidence of glutamate dysfunction in schizophrenia is the observed changes GABAergic transmission. Post-Mortem studies demonstrate decreased expression of GAD67, GAT-1 and GABAA receptor subunits in the prefrontal cortex, although this appears to be restricted to a certain subsets of parvalbumin containing GABAergic neurons. While in vivo imaging of GABAergic signaling appears to be moderately reduced, this may be dependent upon treatment and disease stage.[110]\\r\\nSchizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made.[14] As of 2013 there is no objective test.[5]\\r\\nIn 2013, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met over much of the time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour.[111] The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.\\r\\nThe ICD-10 criteria are typically used in European countries, while the DSM criteria are used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high.[115] The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom.[21]\\r\\nIf signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified, while schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition.[111] Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of pervasive developmental disorder are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.[111]\\r\\nWith the publication of DSM-5, the APA removed all sub-classifications of schizophrenia.[116] The five sub-classifications included in DSM-IV-TR were:[117][118]\\r\\nThe ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes:[117]\\r\\nLatent schizophrenia (F21.1), schizophrenic reaction (F21.2), pseudoneurotic schizophrenia (F21.3), pseudopsychopathic schizophrenia (F21.4), symptom-depleted schizophrenia (F21.5) are in the Russian version of the ICD-10. They are in the category of schizotypal disorder in section F21 of chapter V.[119]\\r\\nPsychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder,[120] borderline personality disorder,[121] drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions (\\"non-bizarre\\") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia.[5] Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance, although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia.[122] A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.[123]\\r\\nA more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms.[124] It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.[5]\\r\\nPrevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.[125] There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia.[126] While there is some evidence that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years.[9] Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended.[127] Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year[128] and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).[129] Another preventative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.[14]\\r\\nThe primary treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often in combination with psychological and social supports.[9] Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs.[16] Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment[130] and support groups are common. Some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia.[131]\\r\\nThe first-line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication,[132] which can reduce the positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. Antipsychotics, however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction.[37][133] In those on antipsychotics, continued use decreases the risk of relapse.[134][135] There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years.[135] However use of anti-psychotics can lead to dopamine hypersensitivity increasing the risk of symptoms if antipsychotics are stopped.[136]\\r\\nThe choice of which antipsychotic to use is based on benefits, risks, and costs.[9] It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are better.[15][137] Amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and clozapine may be more effective but are associated with greater side effects.[138] Typical antipsychotics have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates to atypicals when used at low to moderate dosages.[139] There is a good response in 40ÿ50%, a partial response in 30ÿ40%, and treatment resistance (failure of symptoms to respond satisfactorily after six weeks to two or three different antipsychotics) in 20% of people.[37] Clozapine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs (\\"treatment-resistant\\" or \\"refractory\\" schizophrenia),[140] but it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.[9][14][141]\\r\\nMost people on antipsychotics have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics tend to have a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain.[138] Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.[138] It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.[142]\\r\\nFor people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly, long-acting depot preparations of antipsychotics may be used to achieve control.[143] They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications.[134] When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment.[143] The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping antipsychotics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.[135]\\r\\nA number of psychosocial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy,[144] assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation,[145] skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions for substance use and weight management.[146] Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations.[144] Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal.[147][148] Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not.[149][150] Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.[151][152]\\r\\nSchizophrenia has great human and economic costs.[9] It results in a decreased life expectancy by 10ÿ25?years.[7] This is primarily because of its association with obesity, poor diet, sedentary lifestyles, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role.[9][7][153] Antipsychotic medications may also increase the risk.[7] These differences in life expectancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s.[154]\\r\\nSchizophrenia is a major cause of disability, with active psychosis ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness.[155] Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses[37] and 16.7?million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition.[156] Some people do recover completely and others function well in society.[157] Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support.[9] About 85% are unemployed.[4] Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning.[158] In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%.[159] Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world.[160] These conclusions, however, have been questioned.[161][162]\\r\\nThere is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia. This has been cited at 10%, but a more recent analysis revises the estimate to 4.9%, most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission.[19][163] Several times more (20 to 40%) attempt suicide at least once.[5][164] There are a variety of risk factors, including male gender, depression, and a high intelligence quotient.[164]\\r\\nSchizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies worldwide.[165][166] Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population.[166] Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content.[167] Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.[71]\\r\\nSchizophrenia affects around 0.3ÿ0.7% of people at some point in their life,[9] or 24?million people worldwide as of 2011.[168] It occurs 1.4?times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men[14]the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females.[169] Onset in childhood is much rarer,[170] as is onset in middle or old age.[171]\\r\\nDespite the prior belief that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide, its frequency varies across the world,[5][172] within countries,[173] and at the local and neighborhood level.[174] This variation has been estimated to be fivefold.[4] It causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years[14] and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010.[175] The rate of schizophrenia varies up to threefold depending on how it is defined.[9]\\r\\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization found the percentage of people affected and the number of new cases that develop each year is roughly similar around the world, with age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranging from 343 in Africa to 544 in Japan and Oceania for men, and from 378 in Africa to 527 in Southeastern Europe for women.[176] About 1.1% of adults have schizophrenia in the United States.[177]\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the psychiatrist Kurt Schneider listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices.[178] Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems.[179] The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.[21]\\r\\nThe history of schizophrenia is complex and does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative.[180] Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome are thought to be rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature.[181] The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German alienist Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder (hebephrenia). In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression).[182] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or \\"whole body\\" disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade.[183] His use of the term \\"praecox\\" distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life.[184] It is sometimes argued that the use of the term dmence prcoce in 1852 by the French physician Bndict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.[185]\\r\\nThe word schizophreniawhich translates roughly as \\"splitting of the mind\\" and comes from the Greek roots schizein (?, \\"to split\\") and phrn, phren- (?, Ϛ-, \\"mind\\")[186]was coined by Eugen Bleuler in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between personality, thinking, memory, and perception. American and British interpretations of Bleuler led to the claim that he described its main symptoms as four A's: flattened affect, autism, impaired association of ideas, and ambivalence.[187][188] Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia, as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated, and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead. Treatment was revolutionized in the mid-1950s with the development and introduction of chlorpromazine.[189]\\r\\nIn the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today. It became clear after the 1971 USÿUK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe.[190] This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which used the DSM-II manual, contrasting with Europe and its ICD-9. David Rosenhan's 1972 study, published in the journal Science under the title \\"On being sane in insane places\\", concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable.[191] These were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the revision of the whole DSM manual, resulting in the publication of the DSM-III in 1980.[192]\\r\\nThe term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a \\"split personality\\". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct, multiple personalities; the confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of Bleuler's term \\"schizophrenia\\" (Bleuler originally associated schizophrenia with dissociation, and included split personality in his category of schizophrenia).[193][194] Dissociative identity disorder (having a \\"split personality\\") was also often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the DSM-II.[194][195] The first known misuse of the term to mean \\"split personality\\" was in an article by the poet T. S. Eliot in 1933.[196] Other scholars have traced earlier roots.[197] Rather, the term means a \\"splitting of mental functions\\", reflecting the presentation of the illness.[198]\\r\\nIn 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from seishin-bunretsu-by (^, lit. \\"mind-split disease\\") to tg-shitch-sh (~Ňگ], lit. \\"integration disorder\\") to reduce stigma.[199] The new name was inspired by the biopsychosocial model; it increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 to 70% over three years.[200] A similar change was made in South Korea in 2012.[201] A professor of psychiatry, Jim van Os, has proposed changing the English term to \\"psychosis spectrum syndrome\\".[202]\\r\\nIn the United States, the cost of schizophreniaincluding direct costs (outpatient, inpatient, drugs, and long-term care) and non-health care costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment)was estimated to be $62.7 billion in 2002.[203] The book and film A Beautiful Mind chronicles the life of John Forbes Nash, a Nobel Prizeÿwinning mathematician who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\\r\\nIndividuals with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non-violent crime.[204] Schizophrenia has been associated with a higher rate of violent acts, but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse.[205] Rates of homicide linked to psychosis are similar to those linked to substance misuse, and parallel the overall rate in a region.[206] What role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug misuse is controversial, but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors.[207] About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia while 21% have mood disorders.[208] Another study found about 8-10% of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2% of the general population.[208]\\r\\nMedia coverage relating to violent acts by individuals with schizophrenia reinforces public perception of an association between schizophrenia and violence.[205] In a large, representative sample from a 1999 study, 12.8% of Americans believed that individuals with schizophrenia were \\"very likely\\" to do something violent against others, and 48.1% said that they were \\"somewhat likely\\" to. Over 74% said that people with schizophrenia were either \\"not very able\\" or \\"not able at all\\" to make decisions concerning their treatment, and 70.2% said the same of money-management decisions.[209] The perception of individuals with psychosis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s, according to one meta-analysis.[210]\\r\\nResearch has found a tentative benefit in using minocycline to treat schizophrenia.[211] Nidotherapy or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function, is also being studied; however, there is not enough evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness.[212] Negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat, as they are generally not made better by medication. Various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area.[213] There have been trials on drugs with anti-inflammatory activity, based on the premise that inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.[214]","input":"What is the most common symptom of schizophrenia?"},{"output":"Hindi written in the Devanagari script, as well as English","context":"The Constitution of India designates the official language of the Government of India as Hindi written in the Devanagari script, as well as English.[2] There is no national language as declared by the Constitution of India.[3] Hindi and English are used for official purposes such as parliamentary proceedings, judiciary, communications between the Central Government and a State Government.[2] States within India have the liberty and powers to specify their own official language(s) through legislation and therefore there are 22 officially recognized languages in India of which Hindi is the most used. The number of native Hindi speakers ranges between 14.5 and 24.5% in total Indian population, however, other dialects of Hindi termed as Hindi languages are spoken by nearly 45% of Indians, mostly accounted from the states falling under the Hindi belt. Other Indian languages are each spoken by around 10% or less of the population.[4]\\r\\nStates specify their own official language(s) through legislation. The section of the Constitution of India dealing with official languages therefore includes detailed provisions which deal not just with the languages used for the official purposes of the union, but also with the languages that are to be used for the official purposes of each state and union territory in the country, and the languages that are to be used for communication between the union and the states inter se.\\r\\nDuring the British Raj, English was used for purposes at the federal level.[5] The Indian constitution adopted in 1950 envisaged that Hindi would be gradually phased in to replace English over a fifteen-year period, but gave Parliament the power to, by law, provide for the continued use of English even thereafter.[6] Plans to make Hindi the sole official language of the Republic met with resistance in some parts of the country. Hindi continues to be used today, in combination with other (at the central level and in some states) State official languages at the state level.\\r\\nThe legal framework governing the use of languages for official purpose currently includes the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) Rules, 1976, and various state laws, as well as rules and regulations made by the central government and the states.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Indian constitution, in 1950, declared Hindi in Devanagari script to be the official language of the union. Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of English for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e., on 26 January 1965. The prospect of the changeover, however, led to much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially Dravidian-speaking states whose languages were not related to Hindi at all. As a result, Parliament enacted the Official Languages Act, 1963,[7] [8][9][10][11][12] which provided for the continued use of English for official purposes along with Hindi, even after 1965.\\r\\nIn late 1964, an attempt was made to expressly provide for an end to the use of English, but it was met with protests from states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal, Karnataka, Puducherry and Andhra Pradesh. Some of these protests also turned violent.[13] As a result, the proposal was dropped,[14][15] and the Act itself was amended in 1967 to provide that the use of English would not be ended until a resolution to that effect was passed by the legislature of every state that had not adopted Hindi as its official language, and by each house of the Indian Parliament.[16]\\r\\nThe position was thus that the Union government continues to use English in addition to Hindi for its official purposes[17] as a \\"subsidiary official language,\\"[18] but is also required to prepare and execute a programme to progressively increase its use of Hindi.[19] The exact extent to which, and the areas in which, the Union government uses Hindi and English, respectively, is determined by the provisions of the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, the Official Languages Rules, 1976, and statutory instruments made by the Department of Official Language under these laws.\\r\\nThe Indian constitution draws a distinction between the language to be used in Parliamentary proceedings, and the language in which laws are to be made. Parliamentary business, according to the Constitution, may be conducted in either Hindi or English. The use of English in parliamentary proceedings was to be phased out at the end of fifteen years unless Parliament chose to extend its use, which Parliament did through the Official Languages Act, 1963.[20] In addition, the constitution permits a person who is unable to express themselves in either Hindi or English to, with the permission of the Speaker of the relevant House, address the House in their mother tongue.[21]\\r\\nIn contrast, the constitution requires the authoritative text of all laws, including Parliamentary enactments and statutory instruments, to be in English, until Parliament decides otherwise. Parliament has not exercised its power to so decide, instead merely requiring that all such laws and instruments, and all bills brought before it, also be translated into Hindi, though the English text remains authoritative.[22]\\r\\nThe constitution provides, and the Supreme Court has reiterated, that all proceedings in the Supreme Court of India, the country's highest court and the High Courts, shall be in English.[23] Parliament has the power to alter this by law, but has not done so. However, in many high courts, there is, with consent from the president, allowance of the optional use of Hindi. Such proposals have been successful in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.[24]\\r\\nThe Union government is required by law to progressively increase the use of Hindi in its official work,[19] which it has sought to do through \\"persuasion, incentive and goodwill\\".[7]\\r\\nThe Official Language Act provides that the Union government shall use both Hindi and English in most administrative documents that are intended for the public.[25] The Official Languages Rules, in contrast, provide for a higher degree of use of Hindi in communications between offices of the central government (other than offices in Tamil Nadu, to which the rules do not apply).[26] Communications between different departments within the central government may be in either Hindi or English, although a translation into the other language must be provided if required.[27] Communications within offices of the same department, however, must be in Hindi if the offices are in Hindi-speaking states,[28] and in either Hindi or English otherwise with Hindi being used in proportion to the percentage of staff in the receiving office who have a working knowledge of Hindi.[29] Notes and memos in files may be in either Hindi or English, with the Government having a duty to provide a translation into the other language if required.[30]\\r\\nIn addition, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to a government officer or authority has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in India.\\r\\nVarious steps have been taken by the Indian government to implement the use and familiarisation of Hindi extensively. Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha headquartered at Chennai was formed to spread Hindi in South Indian states. Regional Hindi implementation offices at Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Bhopal, Delhi and Ghaziabad have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\\r\\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the Kendriya Hindi Samiti (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.[31]\\r\\nIn 2016, the Modi government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in Southern and Northeast India.[32][33]\\r\\nThe Indian constitution does not specify the official languages to be used by the states for the conduct of their official functions, and leaves each state free to, through its legislature, adopt Hindi or any language used in its territory as its official language or languages.[34] The language need not be one of those listed in the Eighth Schedule, and several states have adopted official languages which are not so listed. Examples include Kokborok in Tripura and Mizo in Mizoram.\\r\\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the State level largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their official language, Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their mother tongue with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\\r\\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in public administration, and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a petition for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\\r\\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the President, the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of minority languages for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide primary education in the mother tongue for all linguistic minorities, regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\\r\\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective High Courts will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the Governor, rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the President of India, who in these matters acts on the advice of the Government of India. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.[35]\\r\\nFour statesBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan[36] have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar powerTamil Nadu, which sought the right to conduct proceedings in Tamil in its High Courthad its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court.[37] In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state's desire to conduct Madras High Court proceedings in Tamil.[38][39][40][41][42] In 2010, the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court allowed lawyers to argue cases in Tamil.[43]\\r\\nList of official languages of states of India\\r\\nList of official languages of Union Territories of India\\r\\nThe Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution contains a list of 22 scheduled languages. At the time the constitution was enacted, inclusion in this list meant that the language was entitled to representation on the Official Languages Commission,[73] and that the language would be one of the bases that would be drawn upon to enrich Hindi, the official language of the Union.[74] The list has since, however, acquired further significance. The Government of India is now under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages, such that \\"they grow rapidly in richness and become effective means of communicating modern knowledge.\\"[75] In addition, a candidate appearing in an examination conducted for public service at a higher level is entitled to use any of these languages as the medium in which he or she answers the paper.[76]\\r\\nVia the 92nd Constitutional amendment 2003, four new languages?ÿ Dogri, Maithili, Santali and Bodo?ÿ were added to the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution.[77]\\r\\nThe table below lists the 22 languages set out in the Eighth Schedule as of May 2008, together with the regions where they are used.\\r\\nEven though the English language is not included in the Eighth Schedule (as it is a foreign language), it is one of the official languages of the Union of India.[78]\\r\\nOf the 22 official languages, 15 are Indo-Aryan, four are Dravidian, two are Tibeto-Burman, and one is Munda.\\r\\nSince 2003, a government committee has been looking into the feasibility of treating all languages in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution as \\"Official Languages of the Union\\".[86]\\r\\nThe language in which communications between different states, or from the union government to a state or a person in a state, shall be sent is regulated by the Official Languages Act and, for states other than Tamil Nadu, by the Official Languages Rules. Communication between states who use Hindi as their official language is required to be in Hindi, whereas communication between a state whose official language is Hindi and one whose is not, is required to be in English, or, in Hindi with an accompanying English translation (unless the receiving state agrees to dispense with the translation).[17]\\r\\nCommunication between the union and states which use Hindi as their official language (classified by the Official Language Rules as \\"the states in Region A\\"), and with persons who live in those states, is generally in Hindi, except in certain cases.[87] Communication with a second category of states \\"Region B\\", which do not use Hindi as their official language but have elected to communicate with the union in Hindi (currently Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Punjab)[88] is usually in Hindi, whilst communications sent to an individual in those states may be in either Hindi or English.[89] Communication with all other states \\"Region C\\", and with people living in them, is in English.[90]","input":"What is the official language of indian constitution?"},{"output":"August 6 and 9, 1945","context":"","input":"When did the atomic bomb hit hiroshima and nagasaki?"},{"output":"23,055","context":"","input":"How many union soldiers died at the battle of gettysburg?"},{"output":"Spanish","context":"The languages of South America can be divided into three broad groups:\\r\\nThe languages introduced by the process of the European colonization of the Americas are chiefly European, some of whom have given rise to the formation of creoles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish is the majority language of South America, by a small margin.

Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways, commonly known as the Interstate Highway System, is a network of controlled-access highways that forms part of the National Highway System in the United States. The system is named for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who championed its formation. Construction was authorized by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, and the original portion was completed 35 years later, although some urban routes were cancelled and never built. The network has since been extended and, as of  2016[update], it has a total length of 48,191 miles (77,556?km).[2] As of  2016[update], about one-quarter of all vehicle miles driven in the country use the Interstate system.[3] In 2006, the cost of construction was estimated at about $425?billion[4] (equivalent to $499?billion in 2016[5]).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United States government's efforts to construct a national network of highways began on an ad hoc basis with the passage of the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, which provided for $75 million over a five-year period for matching funds to the states for the construction and improvement of highways.[6] The nation's revenue needs associated with World War I prevented any significant implementation of this policy, which expired in 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 1918, E. J. Mehren, a civil engineer and the editor of Engineering News-Record, presented his \\"A Suggested National Highway Policy and Plan\\"[7] during a gathering of the State Highway Officials and Highway Industries Association at the Congress Hotel in Chicago.[8] In the plan, Mehren proposed a 50,000-mile (80,000?km) system, consisting of five eastÿwest routes and 10 northÿsouth routes. The system would include two percent of all roads and would pass through every state at a cost of $25,000 per mile ($16,000/km), providing commercial as well as military transport benefits.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the landmark 1916 law expired, new legislation was passedthe Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act). This new road construction initiative once again provided for federal matching funds for road construction and improvement, $75 million allocated annually.[9] Moreover, this new legislation for the first time sought to target these funds to the construction of a national road grid of interconnected \\"primary highways\\", setting up cooperation among the various state highway planning boards.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bureau of Public Roads asked the Army to provide a list of roads that it considered necessary for national defense.[10] In 1922, General John J. Pershing, former head of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during the war, complied by submitting a detailed network of 20,000 miles (32,000?km) of interconnected primary highwaysthe so-called Pershing Map.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nA boom in road construction followed throughout the decade of the 1920s, with such projects as the New York parkway system constructed as part of a new national highway system. As automobile traffic increased, planners saw a need for such an interconnected national system to supplement the existing, largely non-freeway, United States Numbered Highways system. By the late 1930s, planning had expanded to a system of new superhighways.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave Thomas MacDonald, chief at the Bureau of Public Roads, a hand-drawn map of the United States marked with eight superhighway corridors for study.[12] In 1939, Bureau of Public Roads Division of Information chief Herbert S. Fairbank wrote a report called Toll Roads and Free Roads, \\"the first formal description of what became the interstate highway system\\" and, in 1944, the similarly themed Interregional Highways.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interstate Highway System gained a champion in President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was influenced by his experiences as a young Army officer crossing the country in the 1919 Army Convoy on the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. Eisenhower gained an appreciation of the Reichsautobahn system, the first \\"national\\" implementation of modern Germany's Autobahn network, as a necessary component of a national defense system while he was serving as Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during World War II.[14] He recognized that the proposed system would also provide key ground transport routes for military supplies and troop deployments in case of an emergency or foreign invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe publication in 1955 of the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways, informally known as the Yellow Book, mapped out what became the Interstate System.[15] Assisting in the planning was Charles Erwin Wilson, who was still head of General Motors when President Eisenhower selected him as Secretary of Defense in January 1953.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interstate Highway System was authorized on June 29, 1956 by the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956,[16] popularly known as the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree states have claimed the title of first Interstate Highway. Missouri claims that the first three contracts under the new program were signed in Missouri on August 2, 1956. The first contract signed was for upgrading a section of US Route 66 to what is now designated Interstate 44. On August 13, 1956, Missouri awarded the first contract based on new Interstate Highway funding; this work began on US 40 (now I-70) in St. Charles County.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nKansas claims that it was the first to start paving after the act was signed. Preliminary construction had taken place before the act was signed, and paving started September 26, 1956. The state marked its portion of I-70 as the first project in the United States completed under the provisions of the new Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pennsylvania Turnpike could also be considered one of the first Interstate Highways. On October 1, 1940, 162 miles (261?km) of the highway now designated I?70 and I?76 opened between Irwin and Carlisle. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania refers to the turnpike as the Granddaddy of the Pikes.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nMilestones in the construction of the Interstate Highway System include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial cost estimate for the system was $25?billion over 12?years; it ended up costing $114?billion (adjusted for inflation, $425?billion in 2006 dollars[4]) and took 35?years.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system was proclaimed complete in 1992, but two of the original interstatesI-95 and I-70are not continuous: both of these discontinuities are due to local opposition, which has blocked efforts to build the necessary connections to fully complete the system.\\r\\n\\r\\nI-95 is discontinuous in New Jersey because of the cancellation of the Somerset Freeway. This situation is being remedied; the Pennsylvania Turnpike/Interstate?95 Interchange Project currently under construction will connect the separate sections of I?95 to form a continuous route, completing the final section of the original plan. Construction began in 2010.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, I-70 is discontinuous in Pennsylvania, because of the lack of a direct interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike at the eastern end of the concurrency near Breezewood. Traveling in either direction, I-70 traffic must exit the freeway and use a short stretch of US?30 (which includes a number of roadside services) to rejoin I-70. The interchange was not originally built because of a legacy federal funding rule, since relaxed, which restricted the use of federal funds to improve roads financed with tolls.[29] Solutions have been proposed to eliminate the discontinuity, but they have been blocked by local opposition, fearing a loss of business.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interstate Highway system has been expanded numerous times. The expansions have both created new designations and extended existing designations. For example, I-49, added to the system in the 1980s as a freeway in Louisiana, was designated as an expansion corridor, and FHWA approved the expanded route north from Lafayette, to Kansas City, Missouri. The freeway exists today as separate completed segments, with segments under construction or in the planning phase between them.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, the FHWA designated the entire Interstate Highway System as part of the larger Pan-American Highway System,[32] and at least two proposed Interstate expansions were initiated to help trade with Canada and Mexico spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Long-term plans for I-69, which currently exists in several separate completed segments (the largest of which are in Indiana and Texas), is to have the highway route extend from Tamaulipas, Mexico to Ontario, Canada. The planned I-11 will then bridge the Interstate gap between Phoenix, Arizona and Las Vegas, Nevada, and thus form part of the CANAMEX Corridor (along with I-19, and portions of I-10 and I-15) between Sonora, Mexico and Alberta, Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical opposition from residents canceled many freeway projects around the United States, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has defined a set of standards that all new Interstates must meet unless a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is obtained. One almost absolute standard is the controlled access nature of the roads. With few exceptions, traffic lights (and cross traffic in general) are limited to toll booths and ramp meters (metered flow control for lane merging during rush hour).\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing freeways, Interstate Highways usually have the highest speed limits in a given area. Speed limits are determined by individual states. From 1974 to 1986, the maximum speed limit on any highway in the United States was 55 miles per hour (90?km/h), in accordance with federal law.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, lower limits are established in Northeastern and coastal states, while higher speed limits are established in inland states west of the Mississippi River.[35] For example, the maximum speed limit is 75?mph (120?km/h) in northern Maine, varies between 50 and 70?mph (80 and 115?km/h)[36] from southern Maine to New Jersey, and is 50?mph (80?km/h) in New York City and the District of Columbia.[35] Currently, rural speed limits elsewhere generally range from 65 to 80 miles per hour (105 to 130?km/h). Several portions of various highways such as I-10 and I-20 in rural western Texas, I-80 in Nevada between Fernley and Winnemuca (except around Lovelock) and portions of I-15, I-70, I-80, and I-84 in Utah have a speed limit of 80?mph (130?km/h). Other interstate highways in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming also have the same high speed limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some areas, speed limits on Interstates can be significantly lower in areas where they traverse significantly hazardous areas. The maximum speed limit on I-90 is 50?mph (80?km/h) in downtown Cleveland because of two sharp curves with a suggested limit of 35?mph (55?km/h) in a heavily congested area; I-70 through Wheeling, West Virginia, has a maximum speed limit of 45?mph (70?km/h) through the Wheeling Tunnel and most of downtown Wheeling; and I-68 has a maximum speed limit of 40?mph (65?km/h) through Cumberland, Maryland, because of multiple hazards including sharp curves and narrow lanes through the city. In some locations, low speed limits are the result of lawsuits and resident demands; after holding up the completion of I-35E in St. Paul, Minnesota, for nearly 30?years in the courts, residents along the stretch of the freeway from the southern city limit to downtown successfully lobbied for a 45?mph (70?km/h) speed limit in addition to a prohibition on any vehicle weighing more than 9,000 pounds (4,100?kg) gross vehicle weight. I-93 in Franconia Notch State Park in northern New Hampshire has a speed limit of 45?mph (70?km/h) because it is a parkway that consists of only one lane per side of the highway. On the other hand, Interstates 15, 80 and 84 in Utah have speed limits as high as 70?mph (115?km/h) within the Salt Lake City, Cedar City, and St. George areas, and I-25 in New Mexico within the Santa Fe and Las Vegas areas along with I-20 in Texas along Odessa and Midland and I-29 in North Dakota along the Grand Forks area have higher speed limits of 75?mph (120?km/h).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the components of the National Highway System, Interstate Highways improve the mobility of military troops to and from airports, seaports, rail terminals, and other military bases. Interstate Highways also connect to other roads that are a part of the Strategic Highway Network, a system of roads identified as critical to the U.S. Department of Defense.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system has also been used to facilitate evacuations in the face of hurricanes and other natural disasters. An option for maximizing traffic throughput on a highway is to reverse the flow of traffic on one side of a divider so that all lanes become outbound lanes. This procedure, known as contraflow lane reversal, has been employed several times for hurricane evacuations. After public outcry regarding the inefficiency of evacuating from southern Louisiana prior to Hurricane Georges' landfall in September 1998, government officials looked towards contraflow to improve evacuation times. In Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, in 1999, lanes of I-16 and I-26 were used in a contraflow configuration in anticipation of Hurricane Floyd with mixed results.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004 contraflow was employed ahead of Hurricane Charley in the Tampa, Florida area and on the Gulf Coast before the landfall of Hurricane Ivan;[39] however, evacuation times there were no better than previous evacuation operations. Engineers began to apply lessons learned from the analysis of prior contraflow operations, including limiting exits, removing troopers (to keep traffic flowing instead of having drivers stop for directions), and improving the dissemination of public information. As a result, the 2005 evacuation of New Orleans, Louisiana, prior to Hurricane Katrina ran much more smoothly.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nA widespread urban legend states that one out of every five miles of the Interstate Highway System must be built straight and flat so as to be usable by aircraft during times of war. Contrary to popular lore, Interstate Highways are not designed to serve as airstrips.[41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe numbering scheme for the Interstate Highway System was developed in 1957 by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). The association's present numbering policy dates back to August 10, 1973.[43] Within the continental United States, primary Interstatesalso called main line Interstates or two-digit Interstatesare assigned numbers less than 100.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the numbering scheme for the primary routes, eastÿwest highways are assigned even numbers and northÿsouth highways are assigned odd numbers. Odd route numbers increase from west to east, and even-numbered routes increase from south to north (to avoid confusion with the U.S. Highways, which increase from east to west and north to south), though there are exceptions to both principles in several locations. This numbering system usually holds true even if the local direction of the route does not match the compass directions. For example, I-94 between Chicago and Milwaukee runs primarily northÿsouth, but bears an eastÿwest designation to match its overall orientation, with the \\"east\\" label matching the local southward routing, and so on.  In some cases the deviation can be drastic; for example, I-64 runs almost exactly the wrong way in the Hampton Roads region, where sections that once were labeled \\"east\\" that run almost due west have had these labels removed due to confusion in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. While in many cases, this is due to relatively short deviations, compared to the overall routing of the highway, it is not always the case. For example, I-26 is labeled eastÿwest as its number suggests, but it carries a more generally northÿsouth routing.  Some states, such as Michigan in the case of I-69, have chosen to violate the numbering conventions by signing the route to match its local orientation rather than the normal convention.  Numbers divisible by five are intended to be major arteries among the primary routes, carrying traffic long distances.[44][45] Major northÿsouth arterial Interstates increase in number from I-5 between Canada and Mexico along the West Coast to I?95 between Canada and Miami, Florida along the East Coast; the exception is I-45, which does not leave the state of Texas, running from Galveston to Dallas. Major westÿeast arterial Interstates increase in number from I-10 between Santa Monica, California, and Jacksonville, Florida, to I-90 between Seattle, Washington, and Boston, Massachusetts, with two exceptions. The exception is I-30, which is shorter than the other major eastÿwest interstates, running from Fort Worth, Texas to Little Rock, Arkansas. There are no I-50 and I-60, as routes with those numbers would likely pass through states that currently have U.S. Highways with the same numbers, which is generally disallowed under highway administration guidelines.[43][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral two-digit numbers are shared between road segments at opposite ends of the country for various reasons. Some such highways are incomplete Interstates (such as I-69 and I-74) and some just happen to share route designations (such as I-76, I-84, I?86, I-87, and I-88). Some of these were due to a change in the numbering system as a result of a new policy adopted in 1973. Previously, letter-suffixed numbers were used for long spurs off primary routes; for example, western I?84 was I?80N, as it went north from I?80. The new policy stated, \\"No new divided numbers (such as I-35W and I-35E, etc.) shall be adopted.\\" The new policy also recommended that existing divided numbers be eliminated as quickly as possible; however, an I-35W and I-35E still exist in the DallasÿFort Worth metroplex in Texas, and an I-35W and I-35E that run through Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota, still exist.[43] Additionally, due to Congressional requirements, three sections of I-69 in southern Texas will be divided into I-69W, I-69E, and I-69C (for Central).[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nAASHTO policy allows dual numbering to provide continuity between major control points.[43] This is referred to as a concurrency or overlap. For example, I?75 and I?85 share the same roadway in Atlanta; this 7.4-mile (11.9?km) section, called the Downtown Connector, is labeled both I?75 and I?85. Concurrencies between Interstate and U.S. Route numbers are also allowed in accordance with AASHTO policy, as long as the length of the concurrency is reasonable.[43] In rare instances, two highway designations sharing the same roadway are signed as traveling in opposite directions; one such wrong-way concurrency is found between Wytheville and Fort Chiswell, Virginia, where I?81 north and I?77 south are equivalent (with that section of road traveling almost due east), as are I?81 south and I?77 north.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuxiliary Interstate Highways are circumferential, radial, or spur highways that principally serve urban areas. These types of Interstate Highways are given three-digit route numbers, which consist of a single digit prefixed to the two-digit number of its parent Interstate Highway. Spur routes deviate from their parent and do not return; these are given an odd first digit. Circumferential and radial loop routes return to the parent, and are given an even first digit. Unlike primary Interstates, three-digit Interstates are signed as either eastÿwest or northÿsouth, depending on the general orientation of the route, without regard to the route number.  For instance, I-190 in Massachusetts is labeled northÿsouth, while I-195 in New Jersey is labeled eastÿwest. Some looped Interstate routes use innerÿouter directions instead of compass directions, when the use of compass directions would create ambiguity.  Due to the large number of these routes, auxiliary route numbers may be repeated in different states along the mainline.[48] Some auxiliary highways do not follow these guidelines, however.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interstate Highway System also extends to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, even though they have no direct land connections to any other states or territories. However, their residents still pay federal fuel and tire taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Interstates in Hawaii, all located on the most populous island of Oahu, carry the prefix H. There are three one-digit routes in the state (H-1, H-2, and H-3) and one auxiliary route (H-201). These Interstates connect several military and naval bases together, as well as the important cities and towns spread across Oahu, and especially the metropolis of Honolulu.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Alaska and Puerto Rico also have public highways that receive 90?percent of their funding from the Interstate Highway program. The Interstates of Alaska and Puerto Rico are numbered sequentially in order of funding without regard to the rules on odd and even numbers. They also carry the prefixes A and PR, respectively. However, these highways are signed according to their local designations, not their Interstate Highway numbers. Furthermore, these routes were neither planned according to nor constructed to the official Interstate Highway standards.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn one- or two-digit Interstates, the mile marker numbering almost always begins at the southern or western state line. If an Interstate originates within a state, the numbering begins from the location where the road begins in the south or west. Exceptions exist for Interstate Highways that used segments of roadway that were built prior to Interstate Highway standards being formalized and were grandfathered into the system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree-digit Interstates with an even first number that form a complete circumferential (circle) bypass around a city feature mile markers that are numbered in a clockwise direction, beginning just west of an Interstate that bisects the circumferential route near a south polar location.[citation needed] In other words, mile marker?1 on I-465, a 53-mile (85?km) route around Indianapolis, is just west of its junction with I-65 on the south side of Indianapolis (on the south leg of I-465), and mile marker?53 is just east of this same junction. An exception is I-495 in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area, with mileposts increasing counterclockwise because part of that road is also part of I-95.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exit numbers of interchanges are either sequential or distance-based so that the exit number is the same as the nearest mile marker. Under the latter system, a single mile with multiple exits may be assigned letter suffixes, for example on I?890 in New York.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nAASHTO defines a category of special routes separate from primary and auxiliary Interstate designations. These routes do not have to comply to Interstate construction standards but are routes that may be identified and approved by the association. The same route marking policy applies to both US Numbered Highways and Interstate Highways; however, business route designations are sometimes used for Interstate Highways.[51] Known as Business Loops and Business Spurs, these routes principally travel through the corporate limits of a city, passing through the central business district when the regular route is directed around the city. They also use a green shield instead of the red and blue shield.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstate highways and their rights of way are owned by the state in which they were built. The last federally owned portion of the Interstate System was the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the Washington DC Capital Beltway. The new bridge was completed in 2009 and is collectively owned by Virginia and Maryland.[52] Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the state department of transportation. However, there are some segments of Interstate owned and maintained by local authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 70?percent of the construction and maintenance costs of Interstate Highways in the United States have been paid through user fees, primarily the fuel taxes collected by the federal, state, and local governments. To a much lesser extent they have been paid for by tolls collected on toll highways and bridges. The Highway Trust Fund, established by the Highway Revenue Act in 1956, prescribed a three-cent-per-gallon fuel tax, soon increased to 4.5?cents per gallon. Since 1993 the tax has remained at 18.4?cents per gallon.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the costs of these highways are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5?percent in 2007), as does about 60?percent of the state contribution. However, any local government contributions are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees.[54] The portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57?percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I?95), Maryland (I?95), Virginia (I?95), and Kentucky (I?65).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs American suburbs have expanded, the costs incurred in maintaining freeway infrastructure have also grown, leaving little in the way of funds for new Interstate construction.[55] This has led to the proliferation of toll roads (turnpikes) as the new method of building limited-access highways in suburban areas. Some Interstates are privately maintained (for example, the VMS company maintains I?35 in Texas)[56] to meet rising costs of maintenance and allow state departments of transportation to focus on serving the fastest-growing regions in their states.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of the Interstate System might have to be tolled in the future to meet maintenance and expansion demands, as has been done with adding toll HOV/HOT lanes in cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Although part of the tolling is an effect of the SAFETEA?LU act, which has put an emphasis on toll roads as a means to reduce congestion,[57][58] present federal law does not allow for a state to change a freeway section to a tolled section for all traffic.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 2,900 miles (4,700?km) of toll roads are included in the Interstate Highway System.[59] While federal legislation initially banned the collection of tolls on Interstates, many of the toll roads on the system were either completed or under construction when the Interstate Highway System was established. Since these highways provided logical connections to other parts of the system, they were designated as Interstate highways. Congress also decided that it was too costly to either build toll-free Interstates parallel to these toll roads, or directly repay all the bondholders who financed these facilities and remove the tolls. Thus, these toll roads were grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nToll facilities designated as Interstate highways (such as the Massachusetts Turnpike) were typically allowed to continue collecting tolls, but are generally ineligible to receive federal funds for maintenance and improvements. Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) following the Mianus River Bridge collapse) were required to remove tolls as soon as the highway's construction bonds were paid off.  In addition, these toll facilities were grandfathered from Interstate Highway standards. A notable example is the western approach to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, where I-676 has a surface street section through a historic area.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolicies on toll facilities and Interstate Highways have since changed. The Federal Highway Administration has allowed some states to collect tolls on existing Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of I-376 included a section of Pennsylvania Route?60 that was tolled by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer toll facilities (like the tolled section of I-376, which was built in the early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow \\"Toll\\" sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nLegislation passed in 2005 known as SAFETEA-LU, encouraged states to construct new Interstate Highways through \\"innovative financing\\" methods. SAFETEA-LU facilitated states to pursue innovative financing by easing the restrictions on building interstates as toll roads, either through state agencies or through publicÿprivate partnerships. However, SAFETEA-LU left in place a prohibition of installing tolls on existing toll-free Interstates, and states wishing to toll such routes to finance upgrades and repairs must first seek approval from Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstate Highways financed with federal funds are known as \\"chargeable\\" Interstate routes, and are considered part of the 42,000-mile (68,000?km) network of highways. Federal laws also allow \\"non-chargeable\\" Interstate routes, highways funded similarly to state and U.S. Highways to be signed as Interstates, if they both meet the Interstate Highway standards and are logical additions or connections to the system.[62][63] These additions fall under two categories: routes that already meet Interstate standards, and routes not yet upgraded to Interstate standards. Only routes that meet Interstate standards may be signed as Interstates once their proposed number is approved.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstate Highways are signed by a number placed on a trademarked[64] red, white, and blue sign. The colors red, white, and blue are chosen because they are the colors of the American flag. In the original design, the name of the state was displayed above the highway number, but in many states, this area is now left blank, allowing for the printing of larger and more-legible digits. The sign usually measures 36 inches (91?cm) high, and is 36 inches (91?cm) wide for two-digit Interstates or 45 inches (110?cm) for      three-digit Interstates.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nInterstate business loops and spurs use a special shield in which the red and blue are replaced with green, the word \\"BUSINESS\\" appears instead of \\"INTERSTATE\\", and the word \\"SPUR\\" or \\"LOOP\\" usually appears above the number.[65] The green shield is employed to mark the main route through a city's central business district, which intersects the associated Interstate highway at one (spur) or both (loop) ends of the business route. The route usually traverses the main thoroughfare(s) of the city's downtown area or other major business district.[66] A city may have more than one Interstate-derived business route, depending on the number of Interstates passing through a city and the number of significant business districts therein.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, the design of the Interstate shield has changed. In 1957 the Interstate shield designed by Texas Highway Department employee Richard Oliver was introduced, the winner of a contest that included 100?entries;[68][69] at the time, the shield color was a dark navy blue and only 17 inches (43?cm) wide.[70] The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) standards revised the shield in the 1961,[71] 1971,[72] and 1978[73] editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of Interstates have exit numbers. All traffic signs and lane markings on the Interstates are supposed to be designed in compliance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). There are, however, many local and regional variations in signage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years, California was the only state that did not use an exit numbering system. It was granted an exemption in the 1950s due to having an already largely completed and signed highway system; placing exit number signage across the state was deemed too expensive. To control costs, California began to incorporate exit numbers on its freeways in 2002Interstate, U.S., and state routes alike. Caltrans commonly installs exit number signage only when a freeway or interchange is built, reconstructed, retrofitted, or repaired, and it is usually just tacked onto the top-right corner of an already existing sign. Newer signs along the freeways follow this practice as well. Most exits along California's Interstates now have exit number signage, particularly in rural areas. California, however, still does not use mileposts, although a few exist for experiments or for special purposes.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nExit numbers correspond to Interstate mileage markers in most states. On I?19 in Arizona, however, length is measured in kilometers instead of miles because, at the time of construction, a push for the United States to change to a metric system of measurement had gained enough traction that it was mistakenly assumed that all highway measurements would eventually be changed to metric;[citation needed] proximity to metric-using Mexico may also have been a factor, as I?19 indirectly connects I?10 to the Mexican Federal Highway system via surface streets in Nogales. Mileage count increases from west to east on most even-numbered Interstates; on odd-numbered Interstates mileage count increases from south to north. Some highways, including the New York State Thruway, use sequential exit-numbering schemes. Exits on the New York State Thruway count up from Yonkers traveling north, and then west from Albany.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  November?2010[update], the Illinois State Tollway Authority has redone the mileage markers to be uniform with the rest of the state on I?90 (Jane Addams Memorial/Northwest Tollway) and the I?94 section of the Tri?State Tollway, which previously had matched the I?294 section starting in the south at I?80/I?94/IL Route 394. The tollway is also currently in the process of adding exit number tabs to the exits.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany northeastern states label exit numbers sequentially, regardless of how many miles have passed between exits. States in which Interstate exits are still numbered sequentially are Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont; as such, five of the main Interstate highways that remain completely within these states (87, 88, 89, 91, and 93) have interchanges numbered sequentially along their entire routes. Maine, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Georgia, and Florida followed this system for a number of years, but since converted to mileage-based exit numbers. Georgia renumbered in 2000, while Maine did so in 2004. The Pennsylvania Turnpike uses both mile marker numbers and sequential numbers. Mile marker numbers are used for signage, while sequential numbers are used for numbering interchanges internally. The New Jersey Turnpike, including the portions that are signed as I?95 and I?78, also has sequential numbering, but other Interstates within New Jersey use mile markers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI?87 in New York State is numbered in three sections. The first section makes up the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx, with interchanges numbered sequentially from 1 to 14. The second section of I?87 is a part of the New York State Thruway that starts in Yonkers (exit?1) and continues north to Albany (exit?24); at Albany, the Thruway turns west and becomes I?90 for exits?25 to 61. From Albany north to the Canadian border, the exits on I?87 are numbered sequentially from 1 to 44 along the Adirondack Northway. This often leads to confusion as there is more than one exit on I?87 with the same number. For example, exit?4 on Thruway section of I?87 connects with the Cross County Parkway in Yonkers, but exit?4 on the Northway is the exit for the Albany airport. These two exits share a number but are located 150 miles (240?km) apart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are four common signage methods on Interstates:","input":"Who compiled the first list of national roads?"},{"output":"syphilis","context":"Treponema pallidum is a spirochaete bacterium with subspecies that cause treponemal diseases such as syphilis, bejel, pinta, and yaws. It is a helically coiled microorganism usually 6ÿ15?m long and 0.1ÿ0.2?m wide.[1] The treponemes have a cytoplasmic and an outer membrane. Using light microscopy, treponemes are visible only by using dark field illumination. They are Gram negative, but some regard them as too thin to be Gram stained.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least four subspecies are known:\\r\\nThe cause of pinta is sometimes described as Treponema carateum, rather than a subspecies of T. pallidum, even when the subspecies convention is used for the other agents.[2]\\r\\nThis bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the Dieterle stain. T. pallidum is also detected by serology, including nontreponemal VDRL, rapid plasma reagin, treponemal antibody tests (FTA-ABS), T. pallidum immobilization reaction, and syphilis TPHA test.[3] It was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by Fritz Schaudinn and Erich Hoffmann at the Charit in Berlin in 1905.[4]\\r\\nT. p. pallidum is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close sexual contact, entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar epithelium. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by transplacental passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of T. p. pallidum allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin. In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.[5] It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.\\r\\nThe three subspecies causing yaws, pinta, and bejel, which often cause lesions on the skin and mucous membranes as well as on soft tissue and bone,[6] are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from T. p. pallidum (syphilis); however, their transmission is not venereal and the course of each disease is significantly different.[7]\\r\\nThe incubation period for a T. p. pallidum infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 days to 90 days.[8]\\r\\nThe genome of T. pallidum was sequenced in 1998.[9] The recent sequencing of the genomes of several spirochetes permits a thorough analysis of the similarities and differences within this bacterial phylum. T. p. pallidum has one of the smallest bacterial genomes at 1.14 million base pairs, and has limited metabolic capabilities, reflecting its adaptation through genome reduction to the rich environment of mammalian tissue. The shape of T. pallidum is flat and wavy, unlike the other spirochetes, which are helical.[10]\\r\\nNo vaccine for syphilis is available as of 2017. The outer membrane of T. pallidum has too few surface proteins for an antibody to be effective. Efforts to develop a safe and effective syphilis vaccine have been hindered by uncertainty about the relative importance of humoral and cellular mechanisms to protective immunity,[11] and because T. pallidum outer membrane proteins have not been unambiguously identified.[12] [13]","input":"What disease is caused by bacterium treponema pallidum?"},{"output":"The Old Testament (abbreviated OT)","context":"Outline of Bible-related topics\\r\\nThe Old Testament (abbreviated OT) is the first part of Christian Bibles based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of ancient religious writings by the Israelites[1] believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God.[2] Its counterpart is the New Testament, the second part of the Christian Bible. The books that comprise the Old Testament canon differ between Christian Churches as well as their order and names. The most common Protestant canon comprises 39 books, the Catholic canon comprises 46 books, and the canons of the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches comprise up to 51 books.[3] The 39 books in common to all the Christian canons correspond to the 24 books of the Tanakh, with some differences of order, and there are some differences in text. The additional number reflects the splitting of several texts (Kings, Samuel and Chronicles, EzraÿNehemiah and the minor prophets) into separate books in Christian bibles. The books which are part of a Christian Old Testament but which are not part of the Hebrew canon are sometimes described as deuterocanonical. In general, Protestant bibles do not include deuterocanonical books in their canon, but some versions of Anglican and Lutheran bibles place such books in a separate section called Apocrypha.\\r\\nThe Old Testament consists of many distinct books by various authors[4] produced over a period of centuries. In the most accepted hypothesis, the canon formed in stages, first the Pentateuch by around 400 BC, then the Prophets during the Hasmonean dynasty (140-116 BC), and finally the remaining books.[5][6]\\r\\nChristians traditionally divide the Old Testament into four sections: (1) the first five books or Pentateuch (Torah); (2) the history books telling the history of the Israelites, from their conquest of Canaan to their defeat and exile in Babylon; (3) the poetic and \\"Wisdom books\\" dealing, in various forms, with questions of good and evil in the world; and (4) the books of the biblical prophets, warning of the consequences of turning away from God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Testament contains 39 (Protestant) or 46 (Catholic) or more (Orthodox and other) books, divided, very broadly, into the Pentateuch (Torah), the historical books, the \\"wisdom\\" books and the prophets.[7]\\r\\nThe table uses the spellings and names present in modern editions of the Christian Bible, such as the Catholic New American Bible Revised Edition and the Protestant Revised Standard Version and English Standard Version. The spelling and names in both the 1609ÿ10 Douay Old Testament (and in the 1582 Rheims New Testament) and the 1749 revision by Bishop Challoner (the edition currently in print used by many Catholics, and the source of traditional Catholic spellings in English) and in the Septuagint differ from those spellings and names used in modern editions which are derived from the Hebrew Masoretic text.[a]\\r\\nFor the Orthodox canon, Septuagint titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. For the Catholic canon, the Douaic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions. Likewise, the King James Version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the New Testament, such as \\"Esaias\\" (for Isaiah).\\r\\nIn the spirit of ecumenism more recent Catholic translations (e.g. the New American Bible, Jerusalem Bible, and ecumenical translations used by Catholics, such as the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition) use the same \\"standardized\\" (King James Version) spellings and names as Protestant Bibles (e.g. 1 Chronicles as opposed to the Douaic 1 Paralipomenon, 1ÿ2 Samuel and 1ÿ2 Kings instead of 1ÿ4 Kings) in those books which are universally considered canonical, the protocanonicals.\\r\\nThe Talmud (the Jewish commentary on the scriptures) in Bava Batra 14b gives a different order for the books in Nevi'im and Ketuvim. This order is also cited in Mishneh Torah Hilchot Sefer Torah 7:15. The order of the books of the Torah is universal through all denominations of Judaism and Christianity.\\r\\nThe disputed books, included in one canon but not in others, are often called the Biblical apocrypha, a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the Catholic and Orthodox canons that are absent from the Jewish Masoretic Text and most modern Protestant Bibles. Catholics, following the Canon of Trent (1546), describe these books as deuterocanonical, while Greek Orthodox Christians, following the Synod of Jerusalem (1672), use the traditional name of anagignoskomena, meaning \\"that which is to be read.\\" They are present in a few historic Protestant versions; the German Luther Bible included such books, as did the English 1611 King James Version.[b]\\r\\nEmpty table cells indicate that a book is absent from that canon.\\r\\nSeveral of the books in the Eastern Orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the Latin Vulgate, formerly the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church.\\r\\nThe first five books ÿ Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, book of Numbers and Deuteronomy ÿ reached their present form in the Persian period (538ÿ332 BC), and their authors were the elite of exilic returnees who controlled the Temple at that time.[10] The books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings follow, forming a history of Israel from the Conquest of Canaan to the Siege of Jerusalem c. 587 BC. There is a broad consensus among scholars that these originated as a single work (the so-called \\"Deuteronomistic history\\") during the Babylonian exile of the 6th century BC.[11] The two Books of Chronicles cover much the same material as the Pentateuch and Deuteronomistic history and probably date from the 4th century BC.[12] Chronicles, and EzraÿNehemiah, were probably finished during the 3rd century BC.[13] Catholic and Orthodox Old Testaments contain two (Catholic Old Testament) to four (Orthodox) Books of Maccabees, written in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC.\\r\\nThese history books make up around half the total content of the Old Testament. Of the remainder, the books of the various prophets ÿ Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel and the twelve \\"minor prophets\\" ÿ were written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, with the exceptions of Jonah and Daniel, which were written much later.[14] The \\"wisdom\\" books ÿ Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Psalms, Song of Solomon ÿ have various dates: Proverbs possibly was completed by the Hellenistic time (332-198 BC), though containing much older material as well; Job completed by the 6th Century BC; Ecclesiastes by the 3rd Century BC.[15]\\r\\nGod is consistently depicted as the one who created or put into order[16] the world and guides its history. Although the God of the Old Testament is not consistently presented as the only God who exists, he is always depicted as the only God whom Israel is to worship, or the one \\"true God\\",[17][18] that only the Jehovah of Israel is Almighty, and both Jews and Christians have always interpreted the Bible (both the \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" Testaments) as an affirmation of the oneness of Almighty God.[19]\\r\\nThe Old Testament stresses the special relationship between God and his chosen people, Israel, but includes instructions for proselytes as well. This relationship is expressed in the biblical covenant (contract) between the two, received by Moses. The law codes in books such as Exodus and especially Deuteronomy are the terms of the contract: Israel swears faithfulness to God, and God swears to be Israel's special protector and supporter.[19]\\r\\nFurther themes in the Old Testament include salvation, redemption, divine judgment, obedience and disobedience, faith and faithfulness, among others. Throughout there is a strong emphasis on ethics and ritual purity, both of which God demands, although some of the prophets and wisdom writers seem to question this, arguing that God demands social justice above purity, and perhaps does not even care about purity at all. The Old Testament's moral code enjoins fairness, intervention on behalf of the vulnerable, and the duty of those in power to administer justice righteously. It forbids murder, bribery and corruption, deceitful trading, and many sexual misdemeanors. All morality is traced back to God, who is the source of all goodness.[20]\\r\\nThe problem of evil plays a large part in the Old Testament. The problem the Old Testament authors faced was that a good God must have had just reason for bringing disaster (meaning notably, but not only, the Babylonian exile) upon his people. The theme is played out, with many variations, in books as different as the histories of Kings and Chronicles, the prophets like Ezekiel and Jeremiah, and in the wisdom books like Job and Ecclesiastes.[20]\\r\\nThe process by which scriptures became canons and Bibles was a long one, and its complexities account for the many different Old Testaments which exist today. Timothy H. Lim, a professor of Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Judaism at the University of Edinburgh, identifies the Old Testament as \\"a collection of authoritative texts of apparently divine origin that went through a human process of writing and editing.\\"[4] He states that it is not a magical book, nor was it literally written by God and passed to mankind. By about the 5th century BC Jews saw the five books of the Torah (the Old Testament Pentateuch) as having authoritative status; by the 2nd century BC the Prophets had a similar status, although without quite the same level of respect as the Torah; beyond that, the Jewish scriptures were fluid, with different groups seeing authority in different books.[21]\\r\\nHebrew texts commenced to be translated into Greek in Alexandria in about 280 and continued until about 130 BC.[22] These early Greek translations ÿ supposedly commissioned by Ptolemy Philadelphus ÿ were called the Septuagint (Latin: \\"Seventy\\") from the supposed number of translators involved (hence its abbreviation \\"LXX\\"). This Septuagint remains the basis of the Old Testament in the Eastern Orthodox Church.[23]\\r\\nIt varies in many places from the Masoretic Text and includes numerous books no longer considered canonical in some traditions: 1 and 2 Esdras, Judith, Tobit, 3 and 4 Maccabees, the Book of Wisdom, Sirach, and Baruch.[24] Early modern Biblical criticism typically explained these variations as intentional or ignorant corruptions by the Alexandrian scholars, but most recent scholarship holds it is simply based on early source texts differing from those later used by the Masoretes in their work.\\r\\nThe Septuagint was originally used by Hellenized Jews whose knowledge of Greek was better than Hebrew. But the texts came to be used predominantly by gentile converts to Christianity and by the early Church as its scripture, Greek being the lingua franca of the early Church. The three most acclaimed early interpreters were Aquila of Sinope, Symmachus the Ebionite, and Theodotion; in his Hexapla, Origen placed his edition of the Hebrew text beside its transcription in Greek letters and four parallel translations: Aquila's, Symmachus's, the Septuagint's, and Theodotion's. The so-called \\"fifth\\" and \\"sixth editions\\" were two other Greek translations supposedly miraculously discovered by students outside the towns of Jericho and Nicopolis: these were added to Origen's Octapla.[25]\\r\\nIn 331, Constantine I commissioned Eusebius to deliver fifty Bibles for the Church of Constantinople. Athanasius[26] recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for Constans. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus are examples of these Bibles. Together with the Peshitta and Codex Alexandrinus, these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.[27] There is no evidence among the canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon, however, Jerome (347ÿ420), in his Prologue to Judith, makes the claim that the Book of Judith was \\"found by the Nicene Council to have been counted among the number of the Sacred Scriptures\\".[28]\\r\\nIn Western Christianity or Christianity in the Western half of the Roman Empire, Latin had displaced Greek as the common language of the early Christians, and in 382 AD Pope Damasus I commissioned Jerome, the leading scholar of the day, to produce an updated Latin bible to replace the Vetus Latina, which was a Latin translation of the Septuagint. Jerome's work, called the Vulgate, was a direct translation from Hebrew, since he argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on both philological and theological grounds.[29] His Vulgate Old Testament became the standard bible used in the Western Church, specifically as the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, while the Churches in the East continued, and still continue, to use the Septuagint.[30]\\r\\nJerome, however, in the Vulgate's prologues describes some portions of books in the Septuagint not found in the Hebrew Bible as being non-canonical (he called them apocrypha);[31] for Baruch, he mentions by name in his Prologue to Jeremiah and notes that it is neither read nor held among the Hebrews, but does not explicitly call it apocryphal or \\"not in the canon\\".[32] The Synod of Hippo (in 393), followed by the Council of Carthage (397) and the Council of Carthage (419), may be the first council that explicitly accepted the first canon which includes the books that did not appear in the Hebrew Bible;[33] the councils were under significant influence of Augustine of Hippo, who regarded the canon as already closed.[34]\\r\\nIn the 16th century, the Protestant reformers sided with Jerome; yet although most Protestant Bibles now have only those books that appear in the Hebrew Bible, they have them in the order of the Greek Bible.[35]\\r\\nRome then officially adopted a canon, the Canon of Trent, which is seen as following Augustine's Carthaginian Councils[36] or the Council of Rome,[37][38] and includes most, but not all, of the Septuagint (3 Ezra and 3 and 4 Maccabees are excluded);[39] the Anglicans after the English Civil War adopted a compromise position, restoring the 39 Articles and keeping the extra books that were excluded by the Westminster Confession of Faith, but only for private study and for reading in churches, while Lutherans kept them for private study, gathered in an appendix as Biblical Apocrypha.[35]\\r\\nWhile the Hebrew, Greek and Latin versions of the Hebrew Bible are the best known Old Testaments, there were others. At much the same time as the Septuagint was being produced, translations were being made into Aramaic, the language of Jews living in Palestine and the Near East and likely the language of Jesus: these are called the Aramaic Targums, from a word meaning \\"translation\\", and were used to help Jewish congregations understand their scriptures.[40]\\r\\nFor Aramaic Christians there was a Syriac translation of the Hebrew Bible called the Peshitta, as well as versions in Coptic (the everyday language of Egypt in the first Christian centuries, descended from ancient Egyptian), Ethiopic (for use in the Ethiopian church, one of the oldest Christian churches), Armenian (Armenia was the first to adopt Christianity as its official religion), and Arabic.[40]\\r\\nThe Old Testament is considered one of the most important and influential works of literature in world literature, and has provided inspiration for writers (both religious and secular) throughout subsequent history. In 1886, Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: \\"In the Jewish Old Testament, there are men, things and speeches in so grand a style that Greek and Indian literature have nothing to compare to it. One stands with awe and reverence before these tremendous remnants of what man once was... The taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone of 'greatness' and 'smallness'. To have glued this New Testament, a kind of rococo of taste in every respect, to the Old Testament to form one book... that is perhaps the greatest audacity and sin against the spirit that Europe has on its conscience.\\"[41]\\r\\nChristianity is based on the belief that the historical Jesus is also the Christ, as in the Confession of Peter. This belief is in turn based on Jewish understandings of the meaning of the Hebrew term messiah, which, like the Greek \\"Christ\\", means \\"anointed\\". In the Hebrew Scriptures it describes a king anointed with oil on his accession to the throne: he becomes \\"The LORD's anointed\\" or Yahweh's Anointed. By the time of Jesus, some Jews expected that a flesh and blood descendant of David (the \\"Son of David\\") would come to establish a real Jewish kingdom in Jerusalem, instead of the Roman province.[42]\\r\\nOthers stressed the Son of Man, a distinctly other-worldly figure who would appear as a judge at the end of time; and some harmonised the two by expecting a this-worldly messianic kingdom which would last for a set period and be followed by the other-worldly age or World to Come. Some thought the Messiah was already present, but unrecognised due to Israel's sins; some thought that the Messiah would be announced by a fore-runner, probably Elijah (as promised by the prophet Malachi, whose book now ends the Old Testament and precedes Mark's account of John the Baptist). None predicted a Messiah who suffers and dies for the sins of all the people.[42] The story of Jesus' death therefore involved a profound shift in meaning from the tradition of the Old Testament.[43]\\r\\nThe name \\"Old Testament\\" reflects Christianity's understanding of itself as the fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy of a New Covenant (which is similar to \\"testament\\" and often conflated) to replace the existing covenant between God and Israel (Jeremiah 31:31).[1] The emphasis, however, has shifted from Judaism's understanding of the covenant as a racially or tribally-based contract between God and Jews to one between God and any person of faith who is \\"in Christ\\".[44]","input":"What are the first books of the bible called?"},{"output":"Star Trek Beyond","context":"The Star Trek film series is the cinematic branch of the Star Trek media franchise, which began in 1966 as a weekly television series on NBC, running for three seasons until it was canceled in 1969 because of poor ratings. Reruns of the series proved to be wildly successful in syndication during the 1970s, which persuaded the series' then-owner, Paramount Pictures, to expand the franchise.\\r\\nParamount originally began work on a Star Trek feature film in 1975 after lobbying by the creator of the franchise, Gene Roddenberry. The studio scrapped the project two years later in favor of creating a television series, Star Trek: Phase II, with the original cast. However, following the huge success of Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977, Paramount changed its mind again, halting production on the television series and adapting its pilot episode into a Star Trek feature film, Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979). Five more Star Trek feature films featuring the entire original cast followed. The cast of the 1987ÿ1994 Star Trek spin-off series Star Trek: The Next Generation starred in a further four films. After the release of Star Trek: Nemesis on December 13, 2002, there was a hiatus that lasted almost seven years until a new film was released on May 8, 2009, simply titled Star Trek, serving as a reboot to the franchise with a new cast portraying younger versions of the original series' characters. A sequel to Star Trek (2009), Star Trek Into Darkness, was released in theaters on May 16, 2013. A second sequel, Star Trek Beyond, was released on July 22, 2016, on the franchise's 50th anniversary.\\r\\nThe Star Trek films have received 15 Academy Award nominations. Star Trek (2009) won for Best Makeup in 2010, and four of the previous films were nominated mainly in the areas of makeup, music, set design and sound design.\\r\\nThe early Star Trek films, the first to tenth film, were originally released on VHS; competitive pricing of The Wrath of Khan's videocassette helped bolster the adoption of VHS players in households.[1] Later films were also released on LaserDisc as well. For those films that did not receive an initial DVD release, Paramount released simple one-disc versions with no special features. Later, the first ten films were released in two-disc collector's versions, with The Motion Picture and The Wrath of Khan branded as \\"director's cuts\\", followed by later box set releases. All of the films are now available on Blu-ray, digital download, streaming media and video on demand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStar Trek creator Gene Roddenberry first suggested the idea of a Star Trek feature in 1969.[2] When the original television series was cancelled, he lobbied to continue the franchise through a film. The success of the series in syndication convinced the studio to begin work on a feature film in 1975.[3] A series of writers attempted to craft a suitably epic script, but the attempts did not satisfy Paramount, so the studio scrapped the project in 1977. Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, Star Trek: Phase II. The massive worldwide box office success of Star Wars in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's Close Encounters of the Third Kind had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than Star Wars could do well at the box office, and production of Phase II was cancelled in favor of making a Star Trek film.\\r\\nPrincipal photography for Star Trek: The Motion Picture commenced August 7, 1978[4] with director Robert Wise helming the feature. The production encountered difficulties and slipped behind schedule,[5] with effects team Robert Abel and Associates[6] proving unable to handle the film's large amount of effects work. Douglas Trumbull was hired and given a blank check to complete the effects work in time and location;[7] the final cut of the film was completed just in time for the film's premiere. The film introduced an upgrade to the technology and starship designs, making for a dramatic visual departure from the original series. Many of the set elements created for Phase II were adapted and enhanced for use in the first feature films. It received mixed reviews from critics; while it grossed $139 million the price tag had climbed to about $35 million due to costly effects work and delays.\\r\\nThe Motion Picture's gross was considered disappointing, but it was enough for Paramount to back a sequel with a reduced budget. After Roddenberry pitched a film in which the crew of the Enterprise goes back in time to ensure the assassination of John F. Kennedy, he was \\"kicked upstairs\\" to a ceremonial role while Paramount brought in television producer Harve Bennett to craft a betterand cheaperfilm than the first.[8] After watching all the television episodes, Bennett decided that the character of Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect villain for the new film. Director Nicholas Meyer finished a complete screenplay in just twelve days, and did everything possible within budget to give The Wrath of Khan a nautical, swashbuckling feel,[9] which he described as \\"Horatio Hornblower in outer space.\\"[8] Upon release, the reception of The Wrath of Khan was highly positive;[10] Entertainment Weekly's Mark Bernadin called The Wrath of Khan, \\"the film that, by most accounts, saved Star Trek as we know it\\".[11]\\r\\nMeyer declined to return for the next film, so directing duties were given to cast member Leonard Nimoy for the third film. Paramount gave Bennett the green light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened.[12] The producer penned a resurrection story for Spock that built on threads from the previous film and the original series episode \\"Amok Time\\".[citation needed] Nimoy remained director for the next film in the series. Nimoy and Bennett wanted a film with a lighter tone that did not have a classic antagonist. They decided on a time travel story with the Enterprise crew returning to their past to retrieve something to save their presenteventually, humpback whales. After having been dissatisfied with the script written by Daniel Petrie, Jr., Paramount hired Meyer to rewrite the screenplay with Bennett's help. Meyer drew upon his own time travel story Time After Time for elements[which?] of the script.[citation needed] Star William Shatner was promised his turn as director for Star Trek V, and Nicholas Meyer returned as director/co-writer for Star Trek VI.\\r\\nBoth the sixth and seventh films acted as transitions between the films featuring the original cast and those with the Next Generation cast, with the sixth focusing on the original cast and the seventh focusing on the TNG cast. The Next Generation cast made four films over a period of eight years, with the last two performing only moderately well (Insurrection) and disappointingly (Nemesis) at the box office.\\r\\nAfter the poor reception of Star Trek: Nemesis and the cancellation of the television series Star Trek: Enterprise, the franchise's executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film,[13] entitled Star Trek: The Beginning, which would take place after Enterprise but before The Original Series.[14] J. J. Abrams, the producer of Cloverfield and creator of Lost, was a Star Wars fan as a child and confessed that the Star Trek franchise felt \\"disconnected\\" for him.[15] In February 2007, Abrams accepted Paramount's offer to direct the new Star Trek film, having been previously attached as producer.[16] Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote a script that impressed Abrams, featuring new actors portraying younger versions of the original series' cast. The Enterprise, its interior, and the original uniforms were redesigned. While the film was ready for a December 2008 release, Paramount chose to move the film's opening to May 8, 2009.[17] The film earned over $350 million worldwide (from a solid $75.2 million opening weekend, higher than Star Trek: First Contact (1996)), and surpassed Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home as the highest-grossing film in the franchise. A sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, was greenlighted even before the first one opened, and Paramount released the film on May 17, 2013.[18] A third film, Star Trek Beyond, was directed by Justin Lin and produced by Abrams. It was released on July 22, 2016, also to critical acclaim.\\r\\nThis revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a \\"reboot\\", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a traditional reboot, to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been \\"disrespectful\\". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the \\"Abramsverse\\", \\"JJ Trek\\", and \\"NuTrek\\", before it was named the \\"Kelvin Timeline\\" (versus the \\"Prime Timeline\\" of the original series and films) by Michael and Denise Okuda for use in official Star Trek reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS Kelvin, a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in Star Trek (2009). Abrams named the starship after his grandfather Henry Kelvin, whom he also pays tribute to in Into Darkness with the Kelvin Memorial Archive.[19][20]\\r\\nFans commonly considered the films to follow a \\"curse\\" that even-numbered films were better than the odd-numbered installments.[21][22] The tenth film, Nemesis, was considered the even film that defied the curse.[21][23][24] Its failure and the subsequent success of Star Trek (2009) were considered to have broken the trend.[25][26] The curse has been mentioned often in popular culture. One of the best known examples[27][28] occurred in a 1999 episode of the Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, where it was referenced by Tim Bisley, played by Simon Pegg; Pegg, quite conscious of the irony,[29] played Scotty in the eleventh and subsequent films.\\r\\nA massive energy cloud advances toward Earth, leaving destruction in its wake, and the Enterprise must intercept it to determine what lies within, and what its intent might be.\\r\\nThe movie borrows many elements from \\"The Changeling\\" of the original series and \\"One of Our Planets Is Missing\\" from the animated series.\\r\\nKhan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalbn), whom Kirk thwarted in his attempt to seize control of the Enterprise eighteen years earlier (\\"Space Seed\\"), seeks his revenge and lays a cunning and sinister trap.\\r\\nBoth the first and second films have television versions with additional footage and alternate takes that affect the storyline. (Subsequent Trek films tended to have shorter television versions.) Especially notable in The Wrath of Khan is the footage establishing that a young crew member who acts courageously and dies during an attack on the Enterprise is Scotty's nephew.\\r\\nWhen McCoy begins acting irrationally, Kirk learns that Spock, in his final moments, transferred his katra, his living spirit, to the doctor. To save McCoy from emotional ruin, Kirk and crew steal the Enterprise and violate the quarantine of the Genesis Planet to retrieve Spock, his body regenerated by the rapidly dying planet itself, in the hope that body and soul can be rejoined. However, bent on obtaining the secret of Genesis for themselves, a rogue Klingon (Christopher Lloyd) and his crew interfere, with deadly consequences.\\r\\nThe first film to be a direct sequel to the previous Trek film.\\r\\nWhile returning to stand court-martial for their actions in rescuing Spock, Kirk and crew learn that Earth is under siege by a giant probe that is transmitting a destructive signal, attempting to communicate with the now-extinct species of humpback whales. To save the planet, the crew must time-travel back to the late 20th century to obtain a mating pair of these whales, and a marine biologist (Catherine Hicks) to care for them.\\r\\nThe second through fourth films loosely form a trilogy, with the later plots building on elements of the earlier ones. The third film picks up within several days of the conclusion of the second, the fourth three months after the third. (The fifth film takes place a month after the fourth, but is not directly connected to the plots of the preceding three films.) The third and fourth films were both directed by Leonard Nimoy (also co-writer of the fourth), best known as the actor playing Spock.\\r\\nSpock's half-brother (Laurence Luckinbill) believes he is summoned by God, and hijacks the brand-new (and problem-ridden) Enterprise-A to take it through the Great Barrier, at the center of the Milky Way, beyond which he believes his maker waits for him. Meanwhile, a young and vain Klingon captain (Todd Bryant), seeking glory in what he views as an opportunity to avenge his people of the deaths of their crewmen on Genesis, sets his sights on Kirk.\\r\\nThis is the only film in the franchise directed by William Shatner.\\r\\nWhen Qo'noS' moon Praxis (the Klingon Empire's chief energy source) is devastated by an explosion caused by overmining, the Klingons make peace overtures to the Federation. The Klingon Chancellor (David Warner), while en route to Earth for a summit, is assassinated by Enterprise crewmen, and Kirk is held accountable by the Chancellor's Chief of Staff (Christopher Plummer). Spock attempts to prove Kirk's innocence, but, in doing so, uncovers a massive conspiracy against the peace process with participants from both sides.\\r\\nThis film is a sendoff to the original crew. One Next Generation cast member, Michael Dorn, appears as the grandfather of the character he plays on the later television series. It is the second and last Trek film directed by Nicholas Meyer and last script co-authored by Leonard Nimoy.\\r\\nPicard enlists the help of Kirk, who is presumed long dead but flourishes in an extradimensional realm, to keep a madman (Malcolm McDowell) from destroying a star and its populated planetary system in an attempt to enter that realm.\\r\\nFollowing seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the next Star Trek film was the first to feature the crew of the Enterprise-D along with a long prologue sequence featuring three members of the original cast.\\r\\nAfter a failed attempt to assault Earth, the Borg attempt to prevent First Contact between Humans and Vulcans by interfering with Zefram Cochrane's (James Cromwell) warp test in the past. Picard must confront the demons which stem from his assimilation into the Collective (\\"The Best of Both Worlds\\") as he leads the Enterprise-E back through time to ensure the test and subsequent meeting with the Vulcans take place.\\r\\nThe first of two films directed by series actor Jonathan Frakes.\\r\\nProfoundly disturbed by what he views as a blatant violation of the Prime Directive, Picard deliberately interferes with a Starfleet admiral's (Anthony Zerbe) plan to relocate a relatively small but seemingly immortal population from a planet to gain control of the planet's natural radiation, which has been discovered to have substantial medicinal properties. However, the admiral himself is a pawn in his alien partner's (F. Murray Abraham) mission of vengeance.\\r\\nA clone of Picard (Tom Hardy), created by the Romulans but eventually exiled to hard labor on Remus, assassinates the entire Romulan senate, assumes dictatorship, and lures Picard and the Enterprise to Romulus under the false pretence of a peace overture.\\r\\nThis film was a critical and commercial disappointment (released December 13, 2002 in direct competition with the James Bond film Die Another Day and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers) and was the final Star Trek film to feature the Next Generation cast and to be produced by Rick Berman.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Vulcan is destroyed by Romulans from the future, Starfleet cadet Kirk (Chris Pine) and instructor Spock (Zachary Quinto) must set aside their differences to keep Earth from suffering the same fate.\\r\\nThis film acts as a reboot to the existing franchise by taking place in an \\"alternate reality\\" using the plot device of time travel to depict an altered timeline, featuring younger versions of the original series' cast. It is the first production to feature an entirely different cast of actors playing roles previously established by other actors, with the exception of an aged Spock played by Leonard Nimoy. It was directed by J. J. Abrams (who produced it with Damon Lindelof) and written by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. According to Lindelof, this production was designed to attract a wider audience.[30] It received positive reviews[31] and a number of awards, including the film franchise's only Academy Award, for \\"makeup and hairstyling\\".\\r\\nA Starfleet special agent (Benedict Cumberbatch) coerces an officer into blowing up a secret installation in London, shoots up a subsequent meeting of Starfleet brass in San Francisco, and then flees to Qo'noS. The crew of the Enterprise attempt to bring him to justice without provoking war with the Klingon Empire, but find there is much more to the agent's mission, and the man himself, than what the Fleet Admiral (Peter Weller) has told them.\\r\\nThe Enterprise is ambushed and destroyed by countless alien microvessels; the crew abandon ship. Stranded on an unknown planet, and with no apparent means of escape or rescue, they find themselves in conflict with a new sociopathic enemy (Idris Elba) who has a well-earned hatred of the Federation and what it stands for.\\r\\nStar Trek Beyond was released on July 22, 2016, in time for the franchise's 50th anniversary celebrations. Roberto Orci had stated that Star Trek Beyond will feel more like the original series than its predecessors in the reboot series while still trying something new with the established material.[32] In December 2014, Justin Lin was confirmed as the director for the upcoming sequel,[33] marking the first reboot film not to be directed by J. J. Abrams, whose commitments to Star Wars: The Force Awakens restricted his role on the Star Trek film to that of producer.[34] In January 2015, it was confirmed that the film would be co-written by Doug Jung and Simon Pegg,[35] who revealed the film's title that May.[36] Idris Elba was cast as the villain Krall,[37][38] while Sofia Boutella was cast as Jaylah.[39] Filming began on June 25, 2015.[40] This is the last film of Anton Yelchin (Chekov), who died in an automobile accident on June 19, 2016.\\r\\nPine and Quinto have signed contracts to return as Kirk and Spock for a fourth film.[41] In July 2016, Abrams confirmed plans for a fourth film, and stated that Chris Hemsworth would return as Kirk's father, George, whom he played in the prologue of the first film.[42][43] Later that month, Paramount confirmed the return of Hemsworth as well as most of the Beyond cast, producers Abrams and Lindsey Weber, and writers J. D. Payne and Patrick McKay.[44] That same month, Abrams had said that Chekov would not be recast, after Anton Yelchin died in a motor vehicle accident.[45] In December 2017, Deadline.com reported that Quentin Tarantino is currently working on the next Star Trek theatrical installment with Abrams, with the intention being that the former will direct the film.[46] Mark L. Smith, Lindsey Beer, Megan Amram and Drew Pearce took part in the writers room before Paramount closed a deal with Smith to pen the script.[47]\\r\\nThe following table shows the cast members who played the primary characters in the film series.","input":"What was the most recent star trek movie?"},{"output":"Shurpanakha","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nShurpanakha (Sanskrit: ????????, IAST: ?rpa?akh, lit. she whose fingernails are like winnowing fans) is a character in Valmiki's epic, the Ramayana, and is the sister of the main antagonist, Ravana, King of Lanka.[1] She is known as Soorpanagai in Tamil, Sarpakanaka in Indonesian, Surpanakhar in Khmer, Surapandaki in Malay, and Sammanakkha in Thai.\\r\\n\\r\\nValmiki describes Shurpanakha by the time of the Ramayana's events as generally ugly (ghora mukhi):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe youngest child of Rishi Vishrava and his second wife, Kaikesi, Shurpanakha (the one with lethal and long nails) was given the name of Mؐnakshi \\"Dؐksha\\" at birth, and some also called her Chandranakha (the one with nails like the moon).

In Shurpanakha's absence, Vidyutjihva attacked Ravana, who in self-defense killed his brother-in-law.[2] This earned Ravana his hurt and miserable sister's great displeasure, and the widowed Shurpanakha then split her time between Lanka and the woods of Southern India, sometimes living with her forest-dwelling Asura relatives, Khara and Dushana, on Ravana's orders. She also had conceived a son by Vidyutjihva known as Shambhri who was accidentally killed by Lakshmana.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Valmiki, she met the exiled Prince Rama of Ayodhya, during one such visit to the Forest of Panchavati, and was instantly smitten by his youthful good looks. Rama meanwhile spurned her advances, telling her that he was faithful to his wife Sita and thus would never take another wife. Rejected, Shurpanakha then approached his younger brother, Lakshmana, who reacted in a similar manner and said she was not what he desired in a wife. Eventually seeing that the brothers were making fun of her, the humiliated and envious Shurpanakha attacked Sita but was thwarted by Lakshmana, who cut off her nose and left ear and sent her back to Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\nShurpanakha first went to her brother Khara, who sent seven Rakshasa warriors to attack Rama, who easily dispatched them. Khara himself then attacked, along with 14,000 soldiers, all of whom were killed except for Akampan, Sumali's son and Kaikesi's brother, who fled to Lanka. She then went straight to Ravana's court and enticed her brother to abduct and wed Sita by extolling her virtues and beauty.Akampan too played a key role in instigating, Ravana.Despite opposition from their brother, Vibhishana, Ravana kidnapped Sita, triggering the Battle of Lanka.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Shurpanakha receives no further mention from Valmiki, it has been suggested that she continued to live in Lanka after Vibhishana succeeded Ravana as king. She and her half-sister Kumbini are supposed to have perished at sea a few years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome versions of the Ramayana claim that Shurpanakha had no real romantic interest in the brothers, engineering Ravana's death in revenge for her husband Vidyujjihva's murder. After many years of plotting his downfall, she realized that Ravana had more than a match in Rama, who had killed both her brothers, Khara and Dushana who confronted Rama and Lakshama?a after they were told of insult to Shurpanakha's fate by the duo. Her cousins were terrified of Rama, so Shurpanakha decided to pit her brother against Rama, knowing only that he was powerful enough to slay her brother.","input":"What is the name of ravan's sister?"},{"output":"Four years after the 1868 Meiji Restoration","context":"Okinawa Prefecture (Japanese: ?_, Hepburn: Okinawa-ken, Okinawan:  Uchinaa-chin) is the southernmost prefecture of Japan.[1] It encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu Islands in a chain over 1,000 kilometres (620?mi) long. The Ryukyu Islands extend southwest from Kyushu (the southwesternmost of Japan's four main islands) to Taiwan. Naha, Okinawa's capital, is located in the southern part of Okinawa Island.[2]\\r\\nAlthough Okinawa Prefecture comprises just 0.6 percent of Japan's total land mass, about 75 percent of all United States military personnel stationed in Japan are assigned to installations in the prefecture.[3] Currently about 26,000 U.S. troops are based in the prefecture.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of human existence on the Ryukyu islands is from the Stone Age and was discovered in Naha[5] and Yaeyama.[6] Some human bone fragments from the Paleolithic era were unearthed from a site in Naha, but the artifact was lost in transportation before it was examined to be Paleolithic or not.[5] Japanese Jmon influences are dominant on the Okinawa Islands, although clay vessels on the Sakishima Islands have a commonality with those in Taiwan.[10]\\r\\nThe first mention of the word Ryukyu was written in the Book of Sui.[note 1] Okinawa was the Japanese word identifying the islands, first seen in the biography of Jianzhen, written in 779.[note 2] Agricultural societies begun in the 8th century slowly developed until the 12th century.[note 3][14][15] Since the islands are located at the eastern perimeter of the East China Sea relatively close to Japan, China and South-East Asia, the Ryukyu Kingdom became a prosperous trading nation. Also during this period, many Gusukus, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the Imperial Chinese tributary system under the Ming dynasty beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations.\\r\\nIn 1609, the Shimazu clan, which controlled the region that is now Kagoshima Prefecture, invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Satsuma and the Tokugawa shogunate, while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate.\\r\\nAlthough Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years. Four years after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu han. At the time, the Qing Empire asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands of the Ryukyu Kingdom, since the Ryky Kingdom was also a member state of the Chinese tributary system. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the National Diet (H) which had been established in 1890.[16]\\r\\nNear the end of World War II, in 1945, the US Army and Marine Corps invaded Okinawa with 185,000 troops. A third of the civilian population died;[17] a quarter of the civilian population died during the 1945 Battle of Okinawa alone.[18] The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the Cornerstone of Peace. After the end of World War II, the Ryukyu independence movement developed, while Okinawa was under United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands administration for 27 years. During this \\"trusteeship rule\\", the United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu islands.\\r\\nDuring the Korean War, B-29 Superfortresses flew bombing missions over Korea from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the Cold War increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, the United States Forces Japan (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence.\\r\\nSince 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. to secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports.[19][20][21] The Japanese tended to oppose the introduction of nuclear arms into Japanese territory[22] by the government's assertion of Japan's non-nuclear policy and a statement of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. Most of the weapons were alleged to be stored in ammunition bunkers at Kadena Air Base.[citation needed] Between 1954 and 1972, 19 different types of nuclear weapons were deployed in Okinawa, but with fewer than around 1,000 warheads at any one time.[23]\\r\\nBetween 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for the United States in its military operations directed towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over Cambodia and Laos.[24] Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. In 1965, the US military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between the United States and Okinawa, but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.[25]\\r\\nAs controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the Vietnam War. Okinawa was then perceived, by some inside Japan, as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by the United States.[26] American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.[25]\\r\\nPolitical leaders such as Oda Makoto, a major figure in the Beheiren movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed, that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces ending Japan's involvement in Vietnam.[27] In a speech delivered in 1967 Oda was critical of Prime Minister Satos unilateral support of Americas War in Vietnam claiming \\"Realistically we are all guilty of complicity in the Vietnam War\\".[27] The Beheiren became a more visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the American involvement in Vietnam intensified. The movement employed tactics ranging from demonstrations, to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines directly, warning of the implications for a third World War.[28]\\r\\nThe US military bases on Okinawa became a focal point for anti-Vietnam War sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel were stationed on Okinawa,[29] accustomed to privileges and laws not shared by the indigenous population. The United States Department of Defense began referring to Okinawa as \\"The Keystone of the Pacific\\". This slogan was imprinted on local U.S. military license plates.[30]\\r\\nIn 1969, chemical weapons leaked from the US storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under Operation Red Hat. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months. Even two years later, government investigators found that Okinawans and the environment near the leak were still suffering because of the depot.[31]\\r\\nIn 1972, the U.S. government handed over the islands to Japanese administration.[32]\\r\\nIn a 1981 interview with the Mainichi Shimbun, Edwin O. Reischauer, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, said that U.S. naval ships armed with nuclear weapons stopped at Japanese ports on a routine duty, and this was approved by the Japanese government.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1995 rape of a 12-year-old girl by U.S. servicemen triggered large protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the local population's support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional response has emerged from certain incidents. As a result, the media has drawn renewed interest in the Ryukyu independence movement.\\r\\nDocuments declassified in 1997 proved that both tactical and strategic weapons have been maintained in Okinawa.[33][34] In 1999 and 2002, the Japan Times and the Okinawa Times reported speculation that not all weapons were removed from Okinawa.[35][36] On October 25, 2005, after a decade of negotiations, the governments of the US and Japan officially agreed to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from its location in the densely populated city of Ginowan to the more northerly and remote Camp Schwab in Nago by building a heliport with a shorter runway, partly on Camp Schwab land and partly running into the sea.[17] The move is partly an attempt to relieve tensions between the people of Okinawa and the Marine Corps.\\r\\nOkinawa prefecture constitutes 0.6 percent of Japan's land surface,[17] yet as of 2006[update], 75 percent of all USFJ bases were located on Okinawa, and U.S. military bases occupied 18 percent of the main island.[37]\\r\\nAccording to a 2007 Okinawa Times poll, 85 percent of Okinawans opposed the presence of the U.S. military,[38] because of noise pollution from military drills, the risk of aircraft accidents,[39] environmental degradation,[40] and crowding from the number of personnel there,[41] although 73.4 percent of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence of the USFJ.[42] In another poll conducted by the Asahi Shimbun in May 2010, 43 percent of the Okinawan population wanted the complete closure of the U.S. bases, 42 percent wanted reduction and 11 percent wanted the maintenance of the status quo.[43] Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military are complex, and some of the resentment towards the U.S. bases is directed towards the government in Tokyo, perceived as being insensitive to Okinawan needs and using Okinawa to house bases not desired elsewhere in Japan.\\r\\nIn early 2008, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of 14 by a Marine on Okinawa. The U.S. military also imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew on military personnel and their families to ease the anger of local residents.[44] Some cited statistics that the crime rate of military personnel is consistently less than that of the general Okinawan population.[45] However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, since violence against women is under-reported.[46]\\r\\nBetween 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 burglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults and 2,827 thefts.[18] Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, U.S. service members are convicted of far fewer crimes than local Okinawans.[47]\\r\\nIn 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the US forces relocation plan, but in April 2010 indicated their interest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan.[48]\\r\\nA study done in 2010 found that the prolonged exposure to aircraft noise around the Kadena Air Base and other military bases cause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system in children, and a loss of hearing.[49]\\r\\nIn 2011, it was reported that the U.S. militarycontrary to repeated denials by the Pentagonhad kept tens of thousands of barrels of Agent Orange on the island. The Japanese and American governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange while serving on the island, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as \\"dubious\\", and ignoring their requests for compensation. Reports that more than a third of the barrels developed leaks have led Okinawans to ask for environmental investigations, but as of 2012[update] both Tokyo and Washington refused such action.[50] Jon Mitchell has reported concern that the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs.[51]\\r\\nAs of December?2014[update], one ongoing issue is the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. First promised to be moved off the island and then later within the island, as of November?2014[update] the future of any relocation is uncertain with the election of base-opponent Onaga as Okinawa governor.[52] Onaga won against the incumbent Nakaima who had earlier approved landfill work to move the base to Camp Schwab in Henoko. However, Onaga has promised to veto the landfill work needed for the new base to be built and insisted Futenma should be moved outside of Okinawa.[53]\\r\\nAs of 2006[update], some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the island and relocated to Guam.[54] In November 2008, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Admiral Timothy Keating stated the move to Guam would probably not be completed before 2015.[55]\\r\\nIn 2009, Japan's former foreign minister Katsuya Okada stated that he wanted to review the deployment of U.S. troops in Japan to ease the burden on the people of Okinawa (Associated Press, October 7, 2009)[citation needed] 5,000 of 9,000 Marines will be deployed at Guam and the rest will be deployed at Hawaii and Australia. Japan will pay $3.1 billion cash for the moving and for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in the U.S.-controlled Northern Mariana Islands.[56][57][58]\\r\\nAs of 2014[update], the US still maintains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. These bases include Kadena Air Base, Camp Foster, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Camp Hansen, Camp Schwab, Torii Station, Camp Kinser, and Camp Gonsalves. The area of 14 U.S. bases are 233 square kilometres (90?sq?mi), occupying 18 percent of the main island. Okinawa hosts about two-thirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account for less than one percent of total lands in Japan.[37]\\r\\nSuburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. One third (9,852 acres (39.87?km2))[citation needed] of the land used by the U.S. military is the Marine Corps Northern Training Area (known also as Camp Gonsalves or JWTC) in the north of the island.[59]\\r\\nOn December 21, 2016, 10,000 acres of Okinawa Northern Training Area was returned to Japan.[60]\\r\\nSince the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed the presence of American troops helipads in the Takae zone of the Yanbaru forest near Higashi and Kunigami.[61] This opposition has increased particularly in July 2016 against the construction of six new helipads.[62][63]\\r\\nThe islands comprising the prefecture are the southern two thirds of the archipelago of the Ryky Islands (頢]?u, Ryky-shot). Okinawa's inhabited islands are typically divided into three geographical archipelagos. From northeast to southwest:\\r\\nEleven cities are located within the Okinawa Prefecture. Okinawan names are in parentheses:\\r\\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\\r\\nAs of March 31, 2008, 19 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks, namely the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park; Okinawa Kaigan and Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Parks; and Irabu, Kumejima, and Tonaki Prefectural Natural Parks.[64]\\r\\nThe dugong is an endangered marine mammal related to the manatee.[65] Iriomote is home to one of the world's rarest and most endangered cat species, the Iriomote cat. The region is also home to at least one endemic pit viper, Trimeresurus elegans. Coral reefs found in this region of Japan provide an environment for a diverse marine fauna. The sea turtles return yearly to the southern islands of Okinawa to lay their eggs. The summer months carry warnings to swimmers regarding venomous jellyfish and other dangerous sea creatures.\\r\\nOkinawa is a major producer of sugar cane, pineapple, papaya, and other tropical fruit, and the Southeast Botanical Gardens represent tropical plant species.\\r\\nThe island is largely composed of coral, and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the Battle of Okinawa. Gyokusendo[66] is an extensive limestone cave in the southern part of Okinawa's main island.\\r\\nThe island experiences temperatures above 20?C (68?F) for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (K?ppen climate classification Cfa) in the north, such as Okinawa Island, to tropical rainforest climate (K?ppen climate classification Af) in the south such as Iriomote Island. The islands of Okinawa are surrounded by some of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world.[67][68] The world's largest colony of rare blue coral is found off of Ishigaki Island.[69] Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was reported in Nago on Okinawa Island for the first time on record.[70]\\r\\nOkinawa prefecture age pyramid as of October 1, 2003[71]\\r\\n(per thousands of people)\\r\\nOkinawa Prefecture age pyramid, divided by sex, as of October 1, 2003\\r\\n(per thousands of people)\\r\\nHaving been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan language and culture differ in many ways from those of mainland Japan.\\r\\nThere remain six Ryukyuan languages which are incomprehensible to Japanese speakers, although they are considered to make up the family of Japonic languages along with Japanese. These languages are in decline as Standard Japanese is being used by the younger generation. They are generally perceived as \\"dialects\\" by mainland Japanese and some Okinawans themselves. Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, de facto everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese (\\"Okinawan Japanese\\"), which is often misunderstood as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk music and folk dance. There is a radio news program in the language as well.[72]\\r\\nOkinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by ancestor worship and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.[73]\\r\\nOkinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find Chinese, Thai and Austronesian influences in the island's customs. Perhaps Okinawa's most famous cultural export is karate, probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese kung fu with traditional Okinawan martial arts. Okinawans' reputation as wily resisters of being influenced by conquerors is depicted in the 1956 Hollywood film, The Teahouse of the August Moon, which takes place immediately after World War II.\\r\\nAnother traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is awamorian Okinawan distilled spirit made from indica rice imported from Thailand.\\r\\nOther prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the sanshina three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely related to the Chinese sanxian, and ancestor of the Japanese shamisen, somewhat similar to a banjo. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from pythons, imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan culture also features the eisa dance, a traditional drumming dance. A traditional craft, the fabric named bingata, is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Okinawan diet consist of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okinawans are known for their longevity. This particular island is a so-called Blue Zone, an area where the people live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Five times as many Okinawans live to be 100 as in the rest of Japan, and Japanese are already the longest-lived ethnic group globally.[74] As of 2002[update] there were 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest ratio worldwide.[75]:131ÿ132 Possible explanations are diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island.[75][page?needed]\\r\\nA cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of moais. A moai is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may be a contributing factor to the longevity of its people.[76]\\r\\nIn recent years,[when?] Okinawan literature has been appreciated outside of the Ryukyu archipelago. Two Okinawan writers have received the Akutagawa Prize: Matayoshi Eiki in 1995 for The Pig's Retribution (U?x?, Buta no mukui) and Medoruma Shun in 1997 for A Drop of Water (Suiteki). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by Tatsuhiro Oshiro for Cocktail Party (Kakuteru Pti) and in 1971 by Mineo Higashi for Okinawan Boy (Okinawa no Shnen).[77][78]\\r\\nKarate originated in Okinawa. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be Shrin-ry, Gj-ry and Uechi-ry. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include Matsubayashi-ry, Wad-ry, Isshin-ry, Shrinkan, Shotokan, Shit-ry, Shrinjiry Kenkkan, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and Shrinji-ry.\\r\\nDespite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as gusuku; the most significant are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu).[79] In addition, twenty-one Ryukyuan architectural complexes and thirty-six historic sites have been designated for protection by the national government.[80]\\r\\nWhereas most homes in Japan are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular typhoons. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan.[citation needed]\\r\\nMany roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a shisa, which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe public schools in Okinawa are overseen by the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education. The agency directly operates several public high schools[81] including Okinawa Shogaku High School. The U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS) operates 13 schools total in Okinawa. Seven of these schools are located on Kadena Air Base.\\r\\nOkinawa has many types of private schools. Some of them are cram schools, also known as juku. Others, such as Nova, solely teach language. People also attend small language schools.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere are 10 colleges/universities in Okinawa, including the University of the Ryukyus, the only national university in the prefecture, and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, a new international research institute. Okinawa's American military bases also host the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College.\\r\\nIn addition, various baseball teams from Japan hold training during the winter in Okinawa prefecture as it is the warmest prefecture of Japan with no snow and higher temperatures than other prefectures.\\r\\nThere are numerous golf courses in the prefecture, and there was formerly a professional tournament called the Okinawa Open.\\r\\nThe major ports of Okinawa include:\\r\\nThe 34 US military installations on Okinawa are financially supported by the U.S. and Japan.[89] The bases provide jobs for Okinawans, both directly and indirectly; In 2011, the U.S. military employed over 9,800 Japanese workers in Okinawa.[89] As of 2012[update] the bases accounted for 4 or 5 percent of the economy.[90] However, Koji Taira argued in 1997 that because the U.S. bases occupy around 20 percent of Okinawa's land, they impose a deadweight loss of 15 percent on the Okinawan economy.[91] The Tokyo government also pays the prefectural government around 10 billion per year[89] in compensation for the American presence, including, for instance, rent paid by the Japanese government to the Okinawans on whose land American bases are situated.[92] A 2005 report by the U.S. Forces Japan Okinawa Area Field Office estimated that in 2003 the combined U.S. and Japanese base-related spending contributed $1.9 billion to the local economy.[93] On January 13, 2015, In response to the citizens electing governor Takeshi Onaga, the national government announced that Okinawa's funding will be cut, due to the governor's stance on removing the US military bases from Okinawa, which the national government doesn't want happening.[94][95]\\r\\nThe Okinawa Convention and Visitors Bureau is exploring the possibility of using facilities on the military bases for large-scale Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions events.[96]","input":"When did okinawa become a part of japan?"},{"output":"August 13, 1997","context":"The first season of the animated television series South Park ran for 13 episodes from August 13, 1997 to February 25, 1998 on the American network Comedy Central.[1] The creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wrote most of the season's episodes; Dan Sterling, Philip Stark and David Goodman were credited with writing five episodes. The narrative revolves around four childrenStan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormickand their unusual experiences in the titular mountain town.\\r\\nSouth Park originated from Parker and Stone's 1992 animated short, Jesus vs. Frosty. The low-budget, crudely made film featured prototypes of South Park's main characters and was followed in 1995 by another short film, Jesus vs. Santa. The latter became popular and was widely shared over the Internet, which led to talks for a series with representatives from Fox Network and Comedy Central. It debuted on the latter with an initial run of six episodes; due to its success, an additional seven episodes were quickly produced. The complete season was released on DVD in November 2002.\\r\\nThe first season was a ratings success for Comedy Central. The Nielsen ratings rose from 1.3 to 6.4 from the first to the tenth episode. Several episodes received award nominations, including for a 1998 Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\" and a GLAAD Award in the \\"Outstanding TV?ÿ Individual Episode\\" category for the episode \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\". During the season, South Park won a CableACE Award for \\"Best Animated Series\\" and was nominated for a 1998 Annie Award in the \\"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program\\".\\r\\nThe show was a financial success for Comedy Central and helped the network transform into \\"a cable industry power almost overnight\\".[2] Despite this, critics gave the season mixed reviews. Parents Television Council rated it so offensive that it \\"shouldn't have been made\\": \\"it doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table\\",[3] while another critic thought of it as \\"coming pretty damn close\\" to being a \\"perfect\\" television series season.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea for South Park originated in 1992 when creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone met in a film class as students at the University of Colorado. They discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended a talking piece of feces named Mr. Hankey. Although such a short was never made,[16] Parker and Stone created a Christmas-related animated short commonly known as \\"Jesus vs. Frosty\\". The crude, low-budget animation featured prototypes for the main characters of South Park, including Cartman, Stan and Kyle. Fox Broadcasting Company executive Brian Graden saw the film and in 1995 commissioned Parker and Stone for $1,200 to create a second short film that he could send to his friends as a Christmas video-card. Titled The Spirit of Christmas, but also known as \\"Jesus vs. Santa\\", the short resembled the style of the later series more closely.[17] In 1997, The Spirit of Christmas won the Los Angeles Films Critics Association award for \\"Best Animation\\", thus further bringing the two filmmakers to the attention of industry representatives.[18]\\r\\nThe \\"Jesus vs. Santa\\" video was widely copied and shared over the Internet. George Clooney was reported to have made 300 copies for his friends, and the short was subsequently regarded as likely the first viral video.[2] When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone conceived the idea of a South Park-like show with four child characters but planned to call it The Mr. Hankey Show by featuring a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the main protagonist. They pitched the idea, but Brian Graden rejected it and said, according to Stone, \\"I'm not putting poo on my network.\\"[19] Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around four children in the South Park town, dropping Mr. Hankey as a protagonist but planning to use the character in the future in a minor supporting role.[19]\\r\\nLater, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa short and considered it to be \\"literally the funniest thing [he]'d ever seen,\\" and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network.[2] During the negotiations, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode, with Parker claiming to have asked \\"one thing we have to know before we really go any further: how do you feel about talking poo?\\"[16] The network's executives were receptive to the idea,[20] which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\".[16]\\r\\nThe pilot episode received poor results from test audiences.[19] Parker later conceded that regarding the language, he and Stone felt pressure to live up to their previous two shorts and \\"tried to push things?... maybe further than we should [have].\\"[21] In contrast, they allowed subsequent episodes to \\"be more natural\\",[22] focusing more on making fun of topics considered taboo \\"without just throwing a bunch of dirty words in there.\\"[21] After the poor results from the test audience, Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order additional episodes after \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\". However, when buzz began to generate on the Internet about the two original shorts, the network commissioned Parker and Stone to write one more episode without committing to a full series until they had seen the script. While working on the 1997 film Orgazmo, Parker and Stone wrote the script for what would later become the episode \\"Weight Gain 4000\\". The duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of how the series would be and how each episode could differ from the others. The network liked the script, and when Parker and Stone refused to write another script before signing off on at least six episodes, the executives agreed to commit to a series.[19]\\r\\nComedy Central originally ordered only these six episodes, but when the show proved successful, they requested an additional seven, which Parker and Stone had to produce quickly. \\"Pinkeye\\", the first of these new episodes, would air on October 29, 1997, only two and a half months after the show's premiere.[23][24] There were three holiday episodes\\"Pinkeye\\", \\"Starvin' Marvin\\" and \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\"which aired at intervals of three weeks, while the remaining four aired later in February 1998.[25]\\r\\n\\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\" was the only episode animated almost completely with traditional cut paper, stop-motion animation techniques.[26] All subsequent episodes would be fully computer-animated using Power Animator or Maya.[27] By the eighth episode, \\"Damien\\", much of the drawing and animation responsibilities handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators.[28] This would be the only episode aside from \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\" to receive a TV-14 (unsuitable for children under the age of 14) rating instead of the show's customary TV-MA (unsuitable for under the age of 17).[29] Parker and Stone credit the fourth episode, \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\", with helping to raise the ratings during the early part of the season. They felt that the show's first official Christmas special, \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", brought South Park to a new level of popularity, and Parker said this episode \\"just vaulted everything.\\"[16]\\r\\nSouth Park's first season was a ratings success for Comedy Central.[6] \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\" earned a Nielsen rating of 1.3, translating to 980,000 viewers, which was considered high for a cable program in the United States at the time.[6] It increased slightly by the third episode, \\"Volcano\\", and by the sixth episode, \\"Death\\", the show had reached a rating of 1.7.[6] The ratings continued to rise rapidly from then on, to 3.8 (\\"Pinkeye\\"), 4.8 (\\"Starvin' Marvin'\\"), 5.4 (\\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\"), 6.4 (\\"Damien\\"), and 6.9 (\\"Mecha-Streisand\\") respectively.[6] This corresponded to an increase to 5.4?million viewers in 3.2?million households.[11][12] The season finale, \\"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\\", received a Nielsen rating in the 8.0 range[30] and gained over 300,000 viewers when first aired in Canada in August 1998.[31][32]\\r\\nSouth Park became one of the first television series to be bootlegged via the Internet, just as The Spirit of Christmas had been before it. College students digitized many episodes from the first season and streamed them online for friends who were unable to receive Comedy Central.[33]\\r\\nDespite high ratings, reviews from television critics for the season were mixed. Both The Washington Post and The New York Times had three articles mentioning the show, usually in terms of \\"class-based taste arguments.\\"[18] \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", the first episode of the series, received generally negative reviews after airing. Brent Bozell, founder and then-president of the Parents Television Council, gave an unfavorable review to the episode, stating that the show \\"is so offensive that it shouldn't have been made. It doesn't just push the envelope; it knocks it off the table.\\"[3] Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly thought poorly of the writing and characters, lampooning that \\"if only the kids' jokes were as fresh as their mouths\\" and that \\"it might help if the South Park kids had personalities, but they're as one-dimensional as the show's cut-and-paste animation.\\"[34] Calling the series \\"sophomoric, gross, and unfunny,\\" Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel reckoned that the episode made \\"such a bad impression that it's hard to get on the show's strange wavelength.\\"[35] Tom Shales of The Washington Post considered that \\"most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self-conscious and self-congratulatory in its vulgarity: flatulence jokes, repeated use of the word 'dildo' (in the literal as well as pejorative sense), and a general air of malicious unpleasantness.\\"[2]\\r\\nWhen \\"Weight Gain 4000\\" aired, many writers in the mainstream media were still debating the longevity and the overall quality of South Park. With the series still in its earliest stages, the episode continued to shock many due to the characters frequent use of profanities.[36] Nevertheless, several reviewers felt \\"Weight Gain 4000\\" was a significant improvement over \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\" and felt that it went in a much more satirical direction.[37][38] Several media outlets described the fifth episode of the season, \\"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\\", as one of the most popular early episodes.[39][40][41] Tom Carson of Newsday said it was the most outrageous South Park episode until \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" aired three months later.[42] Many reviewers also said this mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park.[43][44]\\r\\nDue to its impact, South Park made the cover of Rolling Stone in February 1998,[45] and of Newsweek in March 1998.[46] It was discussed in five different New York Times articles in 1998.[18] Franck Rich of The New York Times mentions the show's \\"ability to engage political topics with far more success than other (more obviously political) shows\\" and considered that the show \\"is hilariously candid about faith, family and death as well\\" and \\"is neither politically correct nor incorrect; it's on a different, post-ideological comic map altogether.\\"[47] In 2002, Jeremy Conrad of IGN wrote in a DVD review that it is rare when a television season is \\"perfect\\", but \\"the first season of South Park comes pretty damn close\\" and that \\"almost every single episode in this three-disc set is a classic and each is still funny as hell even after so many viewings over the years.\\"[4]\\r\\nIn 2008, scholar Stephen Groening argued that the show appeared as part of a reaction to the culture wars of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, in which issues such as Murphy Brown's motherhood, Tinky Winky's sexuality, and The Simpsons' family values were extensively debated. The culture wars, and political correctness in particular, were driven by the belief that relativism was becoming more relevant to daily life. Groening explained that South Park \\"made a name for itself as rude, crude, vulgar, offensive, and potentially dangerous\\". Its critics argued that the Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny were poor role models for children while its supporters celebrated the show's defense of free speech.[48]\\r\\nIn 2006, Devin Leonard of Fortune regarded that the launch of South Park transformed Comedy Central from a \\"not-so-funny\\" network to \\"a cable industry power almost overnight.\\"[2] The impact the show had ended up surprising everybody involved.[2] At the time, the cable network had a low distribution of just 21 million subscribers.[18] Comedy Central marketed the show aggressively before its launch, billing it as \\"that's why they invented the V-chip.\\" The resulting buzz led to the network earning an estimated $30 million in T-shirts sales alone before the first episode was even aired.[18]\\r\\nSouth Park became immediately one of the most popular shows on cable television, averaging consistently between 3.5 and 5.5 million viewers.[18] The Denver-based Tele-Communications Inc., the largest cable operator in the U.S. at the time, had just dropped Comedy Central, but when South Park debuted, Denver newspapers and radio stations heavily criticized the operator for not carrying the hit show of the two local filmmakersParker and Stone.[2] Doug Herzog, Comedy Central's president at the time, said that the public \\"went nuts\\" as the network received about ten million new subscriptions through Tele-Communications Inc. alone, \\"which at that time was unheard of.\\"[2]\\r\\nAn affiliate of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in part due to the success of South Park, to have its own independent sales department.[49] By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls.[12] Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers in the first half of 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.[18]\\r\\nSome episodes of the first season received nominations for several entertainment awards. The season's fourth episode \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\" was nominated for an Emmy Award in 1998 in the \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\" category[7] but lost to The Simpsons episode \\"Trash of the Titans\\".[50] The same episode was also nominated for a GLAAD Award in the \\"Outstanding TV?ÿ Individual Episode\\" category[51] but lost to another The Simpsons episode, \\"Homer's Phobia\\".[52] \\"Volcano\\", the season's third episode, was nominated for an Environmental Media Award in the \\"TV Episodic Comedy\\" category[53] but ended up losing to another The Simpsons episode, \\"The Old Man & the Lisa\\".[54][55]\\r\\nDuring the series first season, South Park won a CableACE Award for \\"Best Animated Program or Series\\"[56] and was nominated for an Annie Award in the \\"Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Primetime or Late Night Television Program\\" category.[57] In 1998, the two creators of the show Matt Stone and Trey Parker won the \\"Nova Award\\" given by the Producers Guild of America for the most promising producers in television.[58][59]\\r\\nSix episodes\\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\", \\"Volcano\\", \\"Weight Gain 4000\\", \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\", \\"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\\" and \\"Death\\"were released in a three-VHS set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time South Park was made available on video.[66] The first DVD releases came later that year, when the first Thirteen episodes were released by Warner Home Video on October 27 on the compilation collections South Park, Volume 1,[67] Volume 2[68] and Volume 3.[69] The last episode of the season \\"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\\" was released on the South Park, Volume 4 on December 14, 1999.[70]\\r\\nSouth Park ÿ The Complete First Season was originally released by Warner Home Video as a three-disc region 1 DVD box set in the U.S. on November 12, 2002 and received an MA rating.[63][71] The season was re-released on June 29, 2005 by Paramount Home Entertainment. The DVD releases featured bonus material such as introductions for each episode, two Christmas carols by Eric Cartman and Ned, a short clip featuring Jay Leno and another clip in which the four boys present at the 1997 CableACE Awards. Trey Parker and Matt Stone produced commentaries for each episode but requested they be pulled off altogether when they found out the commentaries would be edited. Instead, the commentaries were released unedited by Comedy Central on a set of five CDs.[62] In October 2005, South Park: Complete Series 1 was released in Australia[65] and with a 15 rating in region 2.[64] \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was released again on November 13, 2005 on the compilation DVD Christmas Time in South Park.[72]\\r\\nThe distribution licenses for six episodes of the South Park's first season (\\"Volcano\\", \\"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\\", \\"Pinkeye\\", \\"Damien\\", \\"Starvin' Marvin\\" and \\"Mecha-Streisand\\") were purchased in 2000 by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based company and website SightSound.com. The site made the episodes available for download for $2.50 for a two-day copy and for $4.95 for a permanent copy. It was one of the first experiments with downloadable television videos, thus making South Park one of the first shows legally obtainable on the Internet.[73][74] In March 2008, Comedy Central made the first season's episodes as well as almost all other South Park episodes available for legal streaming on the South Park Studios website from within U.S.,[75] and later from within Canada[76] and the United Kingdom.[77]","input":"When was the first episode of south park released?"},{"output":"June 24, 2003","context":"","input":"When did beyonce get her first record deal?"},{"output":"nitrogen","context":"The atmosphere of Earth is the layer of gases, commonly known as air, that surrounds the planet Earth and is retained by Earth's gravity. The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation).\\r\\nBy volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen,[1] 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere. Air content and atmospheric pressure vary at different layers, and air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere and in artificial atmospheres.\\r\\nThe atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15G1018?kg,[2] three quarters of which is within about 11?km (6.8?mi; 36,000?ft) of the surface. The atmosphere becomes thinner and thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space. The Krmn line, at 100?km (62?mi), or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space. Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120?km (75?mi). Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition.\\r\\nThe study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology). Early pioneers in the field include Lon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three major constituents of air, and therefore of Earth's atmosphere, are nitrogen, oxygen, and argon. Water vapor accounts for roughly 0.25% of the atmosphere by mass. The concentration of water vapor (a greenhouse gas) varies significantly from around 10 ppm by volume in the coldest portions of the atmosphere to as much as 5% by volume in hot, humid air masses, and concentrations of other atmospheric gases are typically quoted in terms of dry air (without water vapor).[4] The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,[5] among which are the greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other chemical compounds. Many substances of natural origin may be present in locally and seasonally variable small amounts as aerosols in an unfiltered air sample, including dust of mineral and organic composition, pollen and spores, sea spray, and volcanic ash. Various industrial pollutants also may be present as gases or aerosols, such as chlorine (elemental or in compounds), fluorine compounds and elemental mercury vapor. Sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide (SO2) may be derived from natural sources or from industrial air pollution.\\r\\n(A) volume fraction is equal to mole fraction for ideal gas only,\\r\\n????also see volume (thermodynamics)\\r\\n(B) ppmv: parts per million by volume\\r\\n(C) Water vapor is about 0.25% by mass over full atmosphere\\r\\n(D) Water vapor strongly varies locally[4]\\r\\nThe relative concentration of gasses remains constant until about 10,000?m (33,000?ft).[8]\\r\\nIn general, air pressure and density decrease with altitude in the atmosphere. However, temperature has a more complicated profile with altitude, and may remain relatively constant or even increase with altitude in some regions (see the temperature section, below). Because the general pattern of the temperature/altitude profile is constant and measurable by means of instrumented balloon soundings, the temperature behavior provides a useful metric to distinguish atmospheric layers. In this way, Earth's atmosphere can be divided (called atmospheric stratification) into five main layers. Excluding the exosphere, the atmosphere has four primary layers, which are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[9] From highest to lowest, the five main layers are:\\r\\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere (i.e. the upper limit of the atmosphere). It extends from the exobase, which is located at the top of the thermosphere at an altitude of about 700?km above sea level, to about 10,000?km (6,200?mi; 33,000,000?ft) where it merges into the solar wind.\\r\\nThis layer is mainly composed of extremely low densities of hydrogen, helium and several heavier molecules including nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide closer to the exobase. The atoms and molecules are so far apart that they can travel hundreds of kilometers without colliding with one another. Thus, the exosphere no longer behaves like a gas, and the particles constantly escape into space. These free-moving particles follow ballistic trajectories and may migrate in and out of the magnetosphere or the solar wind.\\r\\nThe exosphere is located too far above Earth for any meteorological phenomena to be possible. However, the aurora borealis and aurora australis sometimes occur in the lower part of the exosphere, where they overlap into the thermosphere. The exosphere contains most of the satellites orbiting Earth.\\r\\nThe thermosphere is the second-highest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from the mesopause (which separates it from the mesosphere) at an altitude of about 80?km (50?mi; 260,000?ft) up to the thermopause at an altitude range of 500ÿ1000?km (310ÿ620?mi; 1,600,000ÿ3,300,000?ft). The height of the thermopause varies considerably due to changes in solar activity.[10] Because the thermopause lies at the lower boundary of the exosphere, it is also referred to as the exobase. The lower part of the thermosphere, from 80 to 550 kilometres (50 to 342?mi) above Earth's surface, contains the ionosphere.\\r\\nThe temperature of the thermosphere gradually increases with height. Unlike the stratosphere beneath it, wherein a temperature inversion is due to the absorption of radiation by ozone, the inversion in the thermosphere occurs due to the extremely low density of its molecules. The temperature of this layer can rise as high as 1500?C (2700?F), though the gas molecules are so far apart that its temperature in the usual sense is not very meaningful. The air is so rarefied that an individual molecule (of oxygen, for example) travels an average of 1 kilometre (0.62?mi; 3300?ft) between collisions with other molecules.[12] Although the thermosphere has a high proportion of molecules with high energy, it would not feel hot to a human in direct contact, because its density is too low to conduct a significant amount of energy to or from the skin.\\r\\nThis layer is completely cloudless and free of water vapor. However, non-hydrometeorological phenomena such as the aurora borealis and aurora australis are occasionally seen in the thermosphere. The International Space Station orbits in this layer, between 350 and 420?km (220 and 260?mi).\\r\\nThe mesosphere is the third highest layer of Earth's atmosphere, occupying the region above the stratosphere and below the thermosphere. It extends from the stratopause at an altitude of about 50?km (31?mi; 160,000?ft) to the mesopause at 80ÿ85?km (50ÿ53?mi; 260,000ÿ280,000?ft) above sea level.\\r\\nTemperatures drop with increasing altitude to the mesopause that marks the top of this middle layer of the atmosphere. It is the coldest place on Earth and has an average temperature around ?85?C (?120?F; 190?K).[13][14]\\r\\nJust below the mesopause, the air is so cold that even the very scarce water vapor at this altitude can be sublimated into polar-mesospheric noctilucent clouds. These are the highest clouds in the atmosphere and may be visible to the naked eye if sunlight reflects off them about an hour or two after sunset or a similar length of time before sunrise. They are most readily visible when the Sun is around 4 to 16 degrees below the horizon. A type of lightning referred to as either sprites or ELVES occasionally forms far above tropospheric thunderclouds. The mesosphere is also the layer where most meteors burn up upon atmospheric entrance. It is too high above Earth to be accessible to jet-powered aircraft and balloons, and too low to permit orbital spacecraft. The mesosphere is mainly accessed by sounding rockets and rocket-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe stratosphere is the second-lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It lies above the troposphere and is separated from it by the tropopause. This layer extends from the top of the troposphere at roughly 12?km (7.5?mi; 39,000?ft) above Earth's surface to the stratopause at an altitude of about 50 to 55?km (31 to 34?mi; 164,000 to 180,000?ft).\\r\\nThe atmospheric pressure at the top of the stratosphere is roughly 1/1000 the pressure at sea level. It contains the ozone layer, which is the part of Earth's atmosphere that contains relatively high concentrations of that gas. The stratosphere defines a layer in which temperatures rise with increasing altitude. This rise in temperature is caused by the absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV) radiation from the Sun by the ozone layer, which restricts turbulence and mixing. Although the temperature may be ?60?C (?76?F; 210?K) at the tropopause, the top of the stratosphere is much warmer, and may be near 0?C.[15]\\r\\nThe stratospheric temperature profile creates very stable atmospheric conditions, so the stratosphere lacks the weather-producing air turbulence that is so prevalent in the troposphere. Consequently, the stratosphere is almost completely free of clouds and other forms of weather. However, polar stratospheric or nacreous clouds are occasionally seen in the lower part of this layer of the atmosphere where the air is coldest. The stratosphere is the highest layer that can be accessed by jet-powered aircraft.\\r\\nThe troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. It extends from Earth's surface to an average height of about 12?km, although this altitude actually varies from about 9?km (30,000?ft) at the poles to 17?km (56,000?ft) at the equator,[11] with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is bounded above by the tropopause, a boundary marked in most places by a temperature inversion (i.e. a layer of relatively warm air above a colder one), and in others by a zone which is isothermal with height.[16][17]\\r\\nAlthough variations do occur, the temperature usually declines with increasing altitude in the troposphere because the troposphere is mostly heated through energy transfer from the surface. Thus, the lowest part of the troposphere (i.e. Earth's surface) is typically the warmest section of the troposphere. This promotes vertical mixing (hence the origin of its name in the Greek word ??, tropos, meaning \\"turn\\"). The troposphere contains roughly 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere.[18] The troposphere is denser than all its overlying atmospheric layers because a larger atmospheric weight sits on top of the troposphere and causes it to be most severely compressed. Fifty percent of the total mass of the atmosphere is located in the lower 5.6?km (18,000?ft) of the troposphere.\\r\\nNearly all atmospheric water vapor or moisture is found in the troposphere, so it is the layer where most of Earth's weather takes place. It has basically all the weather-associated cloud genus types generated by active wind circulation, although very tall cumulonimbus thunder clouds can penetrate the tropopause from below and rise into the lower part of the stratosphere. Most conventional aviation activity takes place in the troposphere, and it is the only layer that can be accessed by propeller-driven aircraft.\\r\\nWithin the five principal layers that are largely determined by temperature, several secondary layers may be distinguished by other properties:\\r\\nThe average temperature of the atmosphere at Earth's surface is 14?C (57?F; 287?K)[21] or 15?C (59?F; 288?K),[22] depending on the reference.[23][24][25]\\r\\nThe average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined by the International Standard Atmosphere as 101325 pascals (760.00?Torr; 14.6959?psi; 760.00?mmHg). This is sometimes referred to as a unit of standard atmospheres (atm). Total atmospheric mass is 5.1480G1018 kg (1.135G1019 lb),[27] about 2.5% less than would be inferred from the average sea level pressure and Earth's area of 51007.2 megahectares, this portion being displaced by Earth's mountainous terrain. Atmospheric pressure is the total weight of the air above unit area at the point where the pressure is measured. Thus air pressure varies with location and weather.\\r\\nIf the entire mass of the atmosphere had a uniform density from sea level, it would terminate abruptly at an altitude of 8.50?km (27,900?ft). It actually decreases exponentially with altitude, dropping by half every 5.6?km (18,000?ft) or by a factor of 1/e every 7.64?km (25,100?ft), the average scale height of the atmosphere below 70?km (43?mi; 230,000?ft). However, the atmosphere is more accurately modeled with a customized equation for each layer that takes gradients of temperature, molecular composition, solar radiation and gravity into account.\\r\\nIn summary, the mass of Earth's atmosphere is distributed approximately as follows:[28]\\r\\nBy comparison, the summit of Mt. Everest is at 8,848?m (29,029?ft); commercial airliners typically cruise between 10?km (33,000?ft) and 13?km (43,000?ft) where the thinner air improves fuel economy; weather balloons reach 30.4?km (100,000?ft) and above; and the highest X-15 flight in 1963 reached 108.0?km (354,300?ft).\\r\\nEven above the Krmn line, significant atmospheric effects such as auroras still occur. Meteors begin to glow in this region, though the larger ones may not burn up until they penetrate more deeply. The various layers of Earth's ionosphere, important to HF radio propagation, begin below 100?km and extend beyond 500?km. By comparison, the International Space Station and Space Shuttle typically orbit at 350ÿ400?km, within the F-layer of the ionosphere where they encounter enough atmospheric drag to require reboosts every few months. Depending on solar activity, satellites can experience noticeable atmospheric drag at altitudes as high as 700ÿ800?km.\\r\\nThe division of the atmosphere into layers mostly by reference to temperature is discussed above. Temperature decreases with altitude starting at sea level, but variations in this trend begin above 11?km, where the temperature stabilizes through a large vertical distance through the rest of the troposphere. In the stratosphere, starting above about 20?km, the temperature increases with height, due to heating within the ozone layer caused by capture of significant ultraviolet radiation from the Sun by the dioxygen and ozone gas in this region. Still another region of increasing temperature with altitude occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named thermosphere above 90?km.\\r\\nBecause in an ideal gas of constant composition the speed of sound depends only on temperature and not on the gas pressure or density, the speed of sound in the atmosphere with altitude takes on the form of the complicated temperature profile (see illustration to the right), and does not mirror altitudinal changes in density or pressure.\\r\\nThe density of air at sea level is about 1.2?kg/m3 (1.2?g/L, 0.0012 g/cm3). Density is not measured directly but is calculated from measurements of temperature, pressure and humidity using the equation of state for air (a form of the ideal gas law). Atmospheric density decreases as the altitude increases. This variation can be approximately modeled using the barometric formula. More sophisticated models are used to predict orbital decay of satellites.\\r\\nThe average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 quadrillion (5G1015) tonnes or 1/1,200,000 the mass of Earth. According to the American National Center for Atmospheric Research, \\"The total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.1480G1018?kg with an annual range due to water vapor of 1.2 or 1.5G1015?kg, depending on whether surface pressure or water vapor data are used; somewhat smaller than the previous estimate. The mean mass of water vapor is estimated as 1.27G1016?kg and the dry air mass as 5.1352 I0.0003G1018?kg.\\"\\r\\nSolar radiation (or sunlight) is the energy Earth receives from the Sun. Earth also emits radiation back into space, but at longer wavelengths that we cannot see. Part of the incoming and emitted radiation is absorbed or reflected by the atmosphere. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.[30][31]\\r\\nWhen light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.\\r\\nDifferent molecules absorb different wavelengths of radiation. For example, O2 and O3 absorb almost all wavelengths shorter than 300 nanometers. Water (H2O) absorbs many wavelengths above 700?nm. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it increases the energy of the molecule. This heats the atmosphere, but the atmosphere also cools by emitting radiation, as discussed below.\\r\\nThe combined absorption spectra of the gases in the atmosphere leave \\"windows\\" of low opacity, allowing the transmission of only certain bands of light. The optical window runs from around 300?nm (ultraviolet-C) up into the range humans can see, the visible spectrum (commonly called light), at roughly 400ÿ700?nm and continues to the infrared to around 1100?nm. There are also infrared and radio windows that transmit some infrared and radio waves at longer wavelengths. For example, the radio window runs from about one centimeter to about eleven-meter waves.\\r\\nEmission is the opposite of absorption, it is when an object emits radiation. Objects tend to emit amounts and wavelengths of radiation depending on their \\"black body\\" emission curves, therefore hotter objects tend to emit more radiation, with shorter wavelengths. Colder objects emit less radiation, with longer wavelengths. For example, the Sun is approximately 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), its radiation peaks near 500?nm, and is visible to the human eye. Earth is approximately 290?K (17?C; 62?F), so its radiation peaks near 10,000?nm, and is much too long to be visible to humans.\\r\\nBecause of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations.\\r\\nThe greenhouse effect is directly related to this absorption and emission effect. Some gases in the atmosphere absorb and emit infrared radiation, but do not interact with sunlight in the visible spectrum. Common examples of these are CO2 and H2O.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air is close to, but just greater than 1. Systematic variations in refractive index can lead to the bending of light rays over long optical paths. One example is that, under some circumstances, observers onboard ships can see other vessels just over the horizon because light is refracted in the same direction as the curvature of Earth's surface.\\r\\nThe refractive index of air depends on temperature, giving rise to refraction effects when the temperature gradient is large. An example of such effects is the mirage.\\r\\nAtmospheric circulation is the large-scale movement of air through the troposphere, and the means (with ocean circulation) by which heat is distributed around Earth. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic structure remains fairly constant because it is determined by Earth's rotation rate and the difference in solar radiation between the equator and poles.\\r\\nThe first atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen. There were probably simple hydrides such as those now found in the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), notably water vapor, methane and ammonia. As the solar nebula dissipated, these gases escaped, partly driven off by the solar wind.[32]\\r\\nOutgassing from volcanism, supplemented by gases produced during the late heavy bombardment of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of nitrogen plus carbon dioxide and inert gases.[32] A major part of carbon-dioxide emissions soon dissolved in water and built up carbonate sediments.[clarification needed]\\r\\nResearchers have found water-related sediments dating from as early as 3.8 billion years ago.[33] About 3.4 billion years ago, nitrogen formed the major part of the then stable \\"second atmosphere\\". An influence of life has to be taken into account rather soon in the history of the atmosphere, because hints of early life-forms appear as early as 3.5 billion years ago.[34] How Earth at that time maintained a climate warm enough for liquid water and life, if the early Sun put out 30% lower solar radiance than today, is a puzzle known as the \\"faint young Sun paradox\\".\\r\\nThe geological record however shows a continually relatively warm surface during the complete early temperature record of Earth - with the exception of one cold glacial phase about 2.4 billion years ago. In the late Archean Eon an oxygen-containing atmosphere began to develop, apparently produced by photosynthesizing cyanobacteria (see Great Oxygenation Event), which have been found as stromatolite fossils from 2.7 billion years ago. The early basic carbon isotopy (isotope ratio proportions) strongly suggests conditions similar to the current, and that the fundamental features of the carbon cycle became established as early as 4 billion years ago.\\r\\nAncient sediments in the Gabon dating from between about 2,150 and 2,080 million years ago provide a record of Earth's dynamic oxygenation evolution. These fluctuations in oxygenation were likely driven by the Lomagundi carbon isotope excursion.[35]\\r\\nThe constant re-arrangement of continents by plate tectonics influences the long-term evolution of the atmosphere by transferring carbon dioxide to and from large continental carbonate stores. Free oxygen did not exist in the atmosphere until about 2.4 billion years ago during the Great Oxygenation Event and its appearance is indicated by the end of the banded iron formations.\\r\\nBefore this time, any oxygen produced by photosynthesis was consumed by oxidation of reduced materials, notably iron. Molecules of free oxygen did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until the rate of production of oxygen began to exceed the availability of reducing materials that removed oxygen. This point signifies a shift from a reducing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere. O2 showed major variations until reaching a steady state of more than 15% by the end of the Precambrian.[38] The following time span from 541 million years ago to the present day is the Phanerozoic Eon, during the earliest period of which, the Cambrian, oxygen-requiring metazoan life forms began to appear.\\r\\nThe amount of oxygen in the atmosphere has fluctuated over the last 600 million years, reaching a peak of about 30% around 280 million years ago, significantly higher than today's 21%. Two main processes govern changes in the atmosphere: Plants use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, releasing oxygen. Breakdown of pyrite and volcanic eruptions release sulfur into the atmosphere, which oxidizes and hence reduces the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, volcanic eruptions also release carbon dioxide, which plants can convert to oxygen. The exact cause of the variation of the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere is not known. Periods with much oxygen in the atmosphere are associated with rapid development of animals. Today's atmosphere contains 21% oxygen, which is high enough for this rapid development of animals.[39]\\r\\nThe scientific consensus is that the anthropogenic greenhouse gases currently accumulating in the atmosphere are the main cause of global warming.[40]\\r\\nAir pollution is the introduction into the atmosphere of chemicals, particulate matter or biological materials that cause harm or discomfort to organisms.[41] Stratospheric ozone depletion is caused by air pollution, chiefly from chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances.\\r\\nOn October 19, 2015 NASA started a website containing daily images of the full sunlit side of Earth on http://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The images are taken from the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) and show Earth as it rotates during a day.[42]","input":"What are the main components of earth's atmosphere?"},{"output":"diesel","context":"The Dodge Caliber is a front-engine, front-wheel drive five-door compact hatchback[1] manufactured and marketed by Chrysler's Dodge division from model years 2007 to 2012, replacing the Neon and Chrysler PT Cruiser.\\r\\nFollowing the Caliber concept which debuted at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show,[2] the pre-production version debuted on at the 2006 North American International Auto Show, with market launch in March 2006.\\r\\nThe Caliber was manufactured at the Belvidere Assembly (Illinois) plant, and across its six-year model run, just over 400,000 were produced.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Caliber was one of Dodge's first modern offerings in Europe and in Asian markets such as Japan and Singapore, as it established new distribution channels there. It was also introduced in China in 2008 as Dodge's second modern vehicle offering in that market. Dodge vehicles were last officially sold in China during the World War II era. The introduction of the Caliber had marked the return of the Dodge brand to Australia since the early 1970s.[3]\\r\\nThe Caliber in Japan joined the Chrysler PT Cruiser in 2007, as the PT Cruiser was offered since 2000, but as with previous Chrysler products sold in Japan, the width dimension exceeded Japanese Government dimension regulations, and Japanese consumers were liable for annual taxes for driving a larger car which affected sales. As Chrysler products were considered large to the Japanese market, Chrysler offered products that offered spacious interiors with four doors and one piece liftgates to broaden their appeal to the Japanese as a compromise for paying the annual tax for large vehicles.\\r\\nThe marketing plan for the first year of the Caliber's production included 20% of the budget for online marketing, print ads, and TV commercials.[4]\\r\\nThe Dodge Caliber offered a continuously variable transmission (called CVT2 by Dodge) sourced from Jatco (a Nissan subsidiary), the second DaimlerChrysler model to employ this technology after the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. It uses a four-cylinder 1.8-2.4?L World gasoline engine, designed jointly by Chrysler, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai.\\r\\nThe car features an optional electronically controlled all-wheel drive system with variable torque at speeds of 25 to 65?mph (40 to 105?km/h) for optimal handling.\\r\\nThe Caliber utilizes a heavily modified GS platform, co-designed with Mitsubishi Motors. The modified GS platform is now called the JS platform by Chrysler for mid-size cars and PM/MK for compact cars. It shares a portion of the platform with the Mitsubishi Lancer, but is most similar to the Jeep Compass and Jeep Patriot. The Caliber wheels have a 5-hole pattern with a 114.3?mm bolt circle.\\r\\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Caliber an overall Good score in frontal crash testing. The Dodge Caliber was standard with side curtain airbags, but torso side airbags were optional. The IIHS had scored the Caliber Marginal overall in their side impact test. However, that Caliber was not equipped with the optional torso side airbag.[5]\\r\\nThree models were available at the Caliber's launch, with a fourth available in mid-2006.\\r\\nThe base SE model features front-wheel drive and a 1.8?L 148?hp (110?kW) World I4 attached to a Magna Drivetrain T355 5-speed manual transmission. A 2.0?L 158?hp (118?kW) version of the engine paired with the CVT2 transmission was available as an option.\\r\\nThe standard configuration for the SE lacks air conditioning, power windows, door locks, or mirrors. The grille surround is body-colored, while that of all other models is chromed. Canadian SXT and R/T models feature body color grilles instead of chrome grilles. The Caliber SE doesn't have a tachometer or assist handles, 15?in (38?cm) steel wheels with wheel covers are standard. Some options were not available on the SE.\\r\\nFor 2011, this model was named Express, reverting to SE for 2012. For 2012, the CVT transmission option was dropped only for the SE, leaving the five-speed manual transmission as the only available transmission option for the SE. The CVT continued to be offered in the SXT and SXT Plus models for 2012.\\r\\nThe SXT has the same engine choices as the SE but many more features are available as standard. Air conditioning is standard equipment at this level, including the Chill Zone beverage cooler inside the front lower glove compartment. The gauge cluster gains a tachometer and an (optional) trip computer. The driver's seat adds height adjustment, the passenger seat folds flat for load-carrying, and the rear seats recline. Power windows, locks, mirrors, and remote keyless entry are included. The grille is chromed and 17?in (43?cm) steel wheels are standard, with 17?in (43?cm) aluminum wheels as an option. The cargo area light includes a removable and rechargeable flashlight while the front dome light incorporates two reading lamps. In Europe this version was also commercialized equipped with a VW-built 2.0 liter turbodiesel engine.\\r\\nSome Dodge publications mention a SXT Sport Wagon model, while others (e.g. the Dodge website) list a SXT \\"E\\" package with identical features. This consists of 17?in (43?cm) aluminum wheels, color-keyed cloth seat inserts, color-matched instrument panel trim, along with fog lamps.\\r\\nThe UK SXT Sport model has 18?in (46?cm) alloy wheels, color-keyed cloth seats and instrument panel, and a 9-speaker audio system as standard; early UK models did not have the chrome grille. The UK SXT Sport was available with a Volkswagen 2.0?L diesel engine mated to a six-speed manual transmission.\\r\\nFor 2011, the Heat, Uptown, and Mainstreet were three available trim levels of the Caliber, reverting to SXT and SXT Plus in 2012.\\r\\nThe R/T model has a 2.4?L 172?hp (128?kW) version of the World engine, equipped with the CVT2 transmission, and programmed with an 'AutoStick' feature giving six simulated fixed ratios in a clutchless manual mode in addition to the standard CVT 'Drive' mode. All-wheel-drive was an option on the R/T model until 2009, but with automatic transmission only. Eighteen-inch aluminum wheels were standard, while chromed versions were optional. At launch, the CVT2 with all-wheel drive was the only powertrain combination available for the R/T. A front-wheel drive variant with the T355 5-speed manual transmission commenced production in late summer 2006. ABS was standard, and the suspension and steering systems were tuned for performance.\\r\\nExternally, the R/T is distinguishable by body-color/chrome door handles (replacing black on other models), a chrome side molding, chromed exhaust tip, and front fog lights as standard, as well as R/T badging.\\r\\nInternally, the car came standard with color-keyed fabric seat inserts, while leather seats were an option as on the SXT. Color-keyed instrument panel trim was also standard, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and speed control, and a cargo area cover (all options on the SXT).\\r\\nThe R/T model was discontinued in 2010.\\r\\nThe SRT4 model that was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2006, was a replacement for the original Neon-based SRT-4 produced by Chrysler's Street and Racing Technology group.\\r\\nThe SRT4 hatchback competed with the Volkswagen GTI and the Mazdaspeed3. It featured a 2.4?L DOHC 16V turbocharged I4 with dual variable valve timing (DVVT). The engine produces 285?hp (213?kW) at 6,400?rpm, and 265?lb?ft (359?N?m) of torque at 5,600?rpm using the TD04HL4S-20 turbo. Edmunds.com tested a Caliber SRT4 on a chassis dynamometer and obtained 281?hp (210?kW) and 261?lb?ft (354?N?m) of torque at the wheels. Edmunds called the manufacturer's rating conservative; putting more power to the road than cars costing twice as much. This engine is mated to a Getrag six-speed manual transmission, and utilizes a front-wheel drive drivetrain. The Caliber SRT4 utilizes a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a multilink rear suspension. The SRT4 came with large 13.4?in (34?cm) vented front disc brakes (from the Dodge Charger Police Pack version) with dual-piston calipers and 11.9?in (30?cm) rear single-piston disc brakes. It also featured four-wheel ABS, with electronic assistance. The wheels are 19?in (48?cm), five-spoke, SRT-stamped, painted aluminum and equipped with Goodyear RSA 225/45R19 tires. Package options included polished aluminum wheels, Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires, SIRIUS satellite radio with Kicker SRT livin' loud audio, EVIC with performance pages, security alarm, and optional paint colors.\\r\\nThe SRT4 model of the Caliber was available through 2009.\\r\\nFor the 2009 model, the Caliber underwent a minor revamp. The plain plastic black-colored door handles available on base models were replaced by painted car-colored handles previously available only on R/T. In addition, the trunk lid was reduced in weight and simplified in opening. In the interior, all panels were made black instead of grey. The \\"DODGE\\" badge that was on top of the Ram logo at the middle was shifted to the left, while \\"CALIBER\\" badge was moved to the right from the left, both equal in font size. The car model title, previously indicated on the right, was moved to the bottom right corner of the gate lid.\\r\\nThe 2010 model year was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, featuring a refreshed interior design composed of metallic outlines and parts of glass to suppress the abundance of plastic materials on previous models, as well as the addition of an 8-way power drivers seat, heated mirrors, and an automatic climate control system previously available only on R/T. The dashboard also features the relocation of the glove box due to many customer complaints, which now occupies the spot over the radio panel and comprises a \\"push-open\\" lock instead of the previous \\"squeeze-and-lift\\" opening mechanism.\\r\\nThe 1.8?L engine was dropped from the SE and SXT models, and the SRT-4 model is discontinued. European market models receive a new 2.2?L diesel engine with 163?hp (122?kW) and 236-pound-force-foot (320?N?m) of torque that provides a combined city and highway fuel efficiency of 40.6 miles per US gallon (5.79?L/100?km; 48.8?mpg?imp).[14]\\r\\nFor United States market only, the models were promptly renamed and rebranded, with SE becoming \\"Main Street\\", SXT  \\"Heat\\" and R/T  \\"Rush\\". Two more models were launched in 2010: a luxury all-included variant \\"Uptown\\" and a base variant \\"Express\\" in which the black plastic handles returned. \\"Express\\" was the only model not to feature the automatic climate control as an option, the \\"Main Street\\" featured speed control, anti-lock brake system and electronic stability control, which were previously unavailable as options for SE. All models except \\"Express\\" featured 17-inch wheels.\\r\\nThe 2011 model brought six new paint schemes, standard stability control except on Express models, Sirius traffic when equipped with a navigation system, 18-inch chrome-clad wheels available on Uptown models (17\\" painted are standard), updated steering except on Express models, and new shocks and a thicker rear anti-roll bar on Rush and Heat models.[15] The Caliber and the Nitro were the only two cars in the Dodge vehicle line-up to still feature the Ram logo on both fascia, rear and the steering wheel. The Dodge Nitro also featured driver and passenger's floor mats. The logo was removed from the mats in Calibers with the 2009 model.\\r\\nFor the 2012 model year, the models were renamed back to SE, SXT, and SXT Plus. The Plus version includes all the SXT items and 18-inch aluminum wheels with performance tires, as well as a 6-way power adjustable driver seat.[16] The SXT Plus was not sold in Canada.\\r\\nThe 2010 Caliber was the last model sold in Europe. The 2011 model ended production on November 23, 2011, in United States,[17] with the remainder being sold as the 2012 model year Caliber in both U.S. and Canada.[18] A successor called the Dart,[19] based on the Alfa Romeo Giulietta's platform, went on sale in June 2012 for the 2013 model-year as the compact vehicle in Dodge's lineup.[20]","input":"What kind of gas does a dodge caliber take?"},{"output":"James Henke","context":"The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, recognizes and archives the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the Hall of Fame's permanent home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFounder Ahmet Ertegun assembled a team that included attorney Suzan Evans, Rolling Stone magazine editor and publisher Jann S. Wenner, attorney Allen Grubman, and record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods. The Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home of Bill Haley and American Bandstand), Memphis (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records), Detroit (home of Motown Records), Cincinnati (home of King Records), New York City, and Cleveland.[citation needed]\\r\\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \\"rock and roll\\" and heavily promoted the new genreand that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, the first major rock and roll concert. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 80s, including artist David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush among many others.[2] Cleveland was also one of the premier tour stops for most rock bands.\\r\\nCivic leaders in Cleveland pledged $65 million in public money to fund the construction. A petition drive was signed by 600,000 fans favoring Cleveland over Memphis, and Cleveland ranked first in a 1986 USA Today poll asking where the Hall of Fame should be located. On May 5, 1986, the Hall of Fame Foundation chose Cleveland as the permanent home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Sam Phillips of Sun Studios fame and many others were stunned and disappointed that it ended up in Cleveland. \\"The hall of fame should've been in Memphis, certainly,\\" wrote Peter Guralnick, author of an acclaimed two-volume Elvis Presley biography.[3]\\r\\nCleveland may also have been chosen as the organization's site because the city offered the best financial package. As The Plain Dealer music critic Michael Norman noted, \\"It was $65 million... Cleveland wanted it here and put up the money.\\" Co-founder Jann Wenner later said, \\"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place,\\" but then added, \\"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\\"\\r\\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered the Cuyahoga River. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown Cleveland by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium.\\r\\nAt one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building, but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Dr. Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. The museum tower was initially planned to stand 200?ft (61 m) high, but had to be cut down to 162?ft (49 m) due to its proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2). The groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 7, 1993. Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, Billy Joel, Sam Phillips, Ruth Brown, Sam Moore of Sam and Dave, Carl Gardner of the Coasters and Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum all appeared at the groundbreaking.\\r\\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, among others, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night an all-star concert was held at the stadium. It featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\\r\\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie.[4]\\r\\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 26 times (1986ÿ92, 1994ÿ96, 1998ÿ2008, 2010ÿ11, 2014, 2016 and 2017); twice in Los Angeles (1993 and 2013); and four times in the Hall of Fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012 and 2015). Beginning in 2018, the induction ceremonies will alternate each year between Cleveland and New York.[5]\\r\\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a publicÿprivate partnership between the City of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations and individuals. Collectively these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies filled with both fans and VIPs at Public Hall.[6]\\r\\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions; tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in Induction-related events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.[7]\\r\\nThere are seven levels in the building. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery. It includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm & blues and folk, country and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London and Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, Atlantic Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes two theaters, one of which features a film about the roots of rock and roll and one that features films on various subjects.[8]\\r\\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a cafe, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \\"Backstage Stories.\\" The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips and the evolution of audio technology.[9]\\r\\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \\"The Power of Rock Experience,\\" which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies.[10] Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.[11][12]\\r\\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, Bruce Springsteen, Women Who Rock, and the Rolling Stones.\\r\\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \\"tent\\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\\r\\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf.\\r\\n\\"In designing this building,\\" Pei said, \\"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\\" [13]\\r\\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\\r\\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965 ÿ 1969. It included artifacts from numerous artists, including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, the Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as artifacts related to the Monterey International Pop Festival and Woodstock.\\r\\nThat exhibit was followed by Elvis is in the Building, an exhibit about the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first ever special exhibit devoted to a single artist, Elvis Presley, the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute spanning Elvis' life and legendary career.[14] Next, the museum curated Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story. That was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by Rock Style, an exhibit that focused on rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, from Ray Charles to David Bowie and from Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, Rock Style traveled to other museums in the U.S.\\r\\nOther temporary exhibits have included Lennon: His Life and Work, which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003. It was followed by In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2 and then Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection. A major exhibition on display during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016 was Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics.[15]\\r\\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash), the Doors (Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors), the Who's Tommy (Tommy: The Amazing Journey), and Bruce Springsteen (From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. The museum's current major temporary exhibit is about the history of the magazine Rolling Stone.[16]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th anniversary, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, and John Mellencamp.\\r\\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford,[17] and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll. Every February, the museum celebrates Black History Month[20] by hosting concerts, film screenings and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. Since the program began in 1996, such artists as Robert Lockwood, Jr., the Temptations, Charles Brown, Ruth Brown, the Ohio Players, Lloyd Price, Little Anthony and the Imperials, and Al Green have appeared at the museum during Black History Month.\\r\\nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in a rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. Among the inductees who have taken part in this series are Darryl \\"DMC\\" McDaniels of Run-D.M.C., Lloyd Price, Marky Ramone, Seymour Stein, Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Ronnie Spector, Bootsy Collins, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, and Jorma Kaukonen of the Jefferson Airplane.\\r\\nA similar program is the Legends Series. The only real difference between this program and the Hall of Fame Series is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that include interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists, from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\\r\\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger. Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008),[21] Janis Joplin (2009),[22] Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011),[23] and Chuck Berry (2012).[24]\\r\\n Hall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \\"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\\", created an unordered list of \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\".[25][26] The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995.[27] It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The Beatles with seven songs was the most represented on the 500ÿsong list. The oldest song on the list is \\"Wabash Cannonball\\", written circa 1882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 155 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \\"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \\"Crazy\\" and My Chemical Romance's \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\", both released in 2006.[28] The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660ÿsong list, with eight songs each.\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, Simon & Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony & the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours with Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.[29][30][31]\\r\\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles, and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years. Generally, the number of inductees ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances, by both the inductees and the presenters. The first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences, John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\\r\\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \\"Performers\\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly five hundred experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. To be selected for induction, performers must receive the highest number of votes, and also greater than 50% of the votes. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.[32]\\r\\nIn 2012, six additional groups, the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets, were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \\"There was a lot of discussion about this,\\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \\"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question ÿ it was so long ago... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\\"[33]\\r\\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras, primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues, whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny & The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musicians Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \\"rock era\\".\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Non-Performers\\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters and music journalists. This category has had at least one inductee every year except 2007 and 2009. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.[34]\\r\\nFormerly the \\"Sidemen\\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \\"Award for Musical Excellence\\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \\"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\\"[35]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The Library and Archives is located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\\r\\nThe Library and Archives' mission is to collect, preserve and provide access to these materials. The Library and Archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library and read the books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\\r\\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings, and research databases.\\r\\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.[36][37][38]\\r\\nThe most frequent criticism of the Hall of Fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a few individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founder Jann Wenner (co-founder and editor-in-chief of Rolling Stone magazine), former foundation director Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than the views of the rock world as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \\"At one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\\"[39] Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often considered \\"The Godmother/Grandmother of Rock & Roll\\",[40][41] but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Also, the influential soul/funk group Tower of Power has not yet been honored. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the Hall of Fame as the \\"Hall of Lame\\".[42]\\r\\nThere is also controversy in the lack of transparency in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of The New York Times wrote:\\r\\n\\"With fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders ÿ and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\\"[43]\\r\\nJon Landau, the chairman of the nominating committee, says they prefer it that way. \\"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\\"[43]\\r\\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all.[39] The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres.[44] According to author Brett Milano, \\"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music.\\"[45] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).[46]\\r\\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In fifteen years, 97 different artists were inducted.[47] A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted; although, the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped.[47] The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (12 in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.[48]\\r\\nMembers of the British punk rock band The Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \\"a piss stain\\" and \\"urine in wine\\".[49]\\r\\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, the singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \\"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\\"[50][51] In fact, the actual percentage of woman inductees is 8.5%.[52] Combining all the categories, there have been 719 inductees, out of which only 61 have been women, none of which has been inducted more than once or awarded the Lifetime Achievement.[53]\\r\\n2016 inductee Steve Miller voiced a litany of criticisms directed at the hall, both during his induction speech and, especially, in interviews after it. His complaints included a lack of female inductees, not enough support by the hall for music education, and treatment of inductees at the award ceremony.[54]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article claiming that the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say \\"Jann Wenner used a technicality about the day votes were due in. In reality, The Dave Clark Five got six more votes than Grandmaster Flash. But he felt we couldn't go another year without a rap act.\\"[46]\\r\\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation would later deny fixing the vote, although they did not deny that late votes were received, saying, \\"No. There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\\"[55] The Dave Clark Five was subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.[56]\\r\\nIn June 2007, Monkee Peter Tork complained to the New York Post that Wenner had blackballed the Monkees, commenting:\\r\\n[Wenner] doesn't care what the rules are and just operates how he sees fit. It is an abuse of power. I don't know whether the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame, but it's pretty clear that we're not in there because of a personal whim. Jann seems to have taken it harder than everyone else, and now, 40 years later, everybody says, 'What's the big deal? Everybody else does it.' [Uses studio artists or backing bands.] Nobody cares now except him. He feels his moral judgment in 1967 and 1968 is supposed to serve in 2007.\\r\\nIn a Facebook post, fellow Monkee Michael Nesmith stated that he does not know if the Monkees belong in the Hall of Fame because he can only see the impact of the Monkees from the inside, and further stated: \\"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\\"[57]\\r\\nVarious magazines and news outlets, such as Time,[58] NPR radio,[59] The Christian Science Monitor,[60] Goldmine magazine,[61][62] Yahoo Music[63] and MSNBC [64] have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.","input":"Who is the curatorial director of the rock and roll hall of fame museum?"},{"output":"Czech","context":"Czech (/t??k/; ?e?tina Czech pronunciation: [?t???c?na]), historically also Bohemian[6] (/bo??hi?mi?n, b?-/;[7] lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language of the CzechÿSlovak group.[6] Spoken by over 10 million people, it serves as the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the point of mutual intelligibility to a very high degree.[8] Like other Slavic languages, Czech is a fusional language with a rich system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin[9] and German.[10]\\r\\nThe CzechÿSlovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the CzechÿSlovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later 18th to mid-19th century, the modern written standard became codified in the context of the Czech National Revival. The main vernacular, known as Common Czech, is based on the vernacular of Prague, but is now spoken throughout most of the Czech Republic. The Moravian dialects spoken in the eastern part of the country are also classified as Czech, although some of their eastern variants are closer to Slovak.\\r\\nCzech has a moderately-sized phoneme inventory, comprising ten monophthongs, three diphthongs and 25 consonants (divided into \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" and \\"soft\\" categories). Words may contain complicated consonant clusters or lack vowels altogether. Czech has a raised alveolar trill, which is not known to occur as a phoneme in any other language, represented by the grapheme ?. Czech uses a simple orthography which phonologists have used as a model.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCzech is a member of the West Slavic sub-branch of the Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. This branch includes Polish, Kashubian, Upper and Lower Sorbian and Slovak. Slovak is the closest language genetic neighbor of Czech, followed by Polish and Silesian.[11]\\r\\nThe West Slavic languages are spoken in Central Europe. Czech is distinguished from other West Slavic languages by a more-restricted distinction between \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" consonants (see Phonology below).[11]\\r\\nThe term \\"Old Czech\\" is applied to the period predating the 16th century, with the earliest records of the high medieval period also classified as \\"early Old Czech\\", but the term \\"Medieval Czech\\" is also used.\\r\\nAround the 7th century, the Slavic expansion reached Central Europe, settling on the eastern fringes of the Frankish Empire. The West Slavic polity of Great Moravia formed by the 9th century. The Christianization of Bohemia took place during the 9th and 10th centuries. The diversification of the Czech-Slovak group within West Slavic began around that time, marked among other things by its ephemeral use of the voiced velar fricative consonant (/?/)[12] and consistent stress on the first syllable.[13]\\r\\nThe Bohemian (Czech) language is first recorded in writing in glosses and short notes during the 12th to 13th centuries. Literary works written in Czech appear in the early 14th century and administrative documents first appear towards the late 14th century. The first complete Bible translation also dates to this period.[14] Old Czech texts, including poetry and cookbooks, were produced outside the university as well.[15]\\r\\nLiterary activity becomes widespread in the early 15th century in the context of the Bohemian Reformation. Jan Hus contributed significantly to the standardization of Czech orthography, advocated for widespread literacy among Czech commoners (particularly in religion) and made early efforts to model written Czech after the spoken language.[14]\\r\\nThere was no standardization distinguishing between Czech and Slovak prior to the 15th century.[16] In the 16th century, the division between Czech and Slovak becomes apparent, marking the confessional division between Lutheran Protestants in Slovakia using Czech orthography and Catholics, especially Slovak Jesuits, beginning to use a separate Slovak orthography based on the language of the Trnava region.\\r\\nThe publication of the Kralice Bible between 1579 and 1593 (the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages) became very important for standardization of the Czech language in the following centuries.\\r\\nIn 1615, the Bohemian diet tried to declare Czech to be the only official language of the kingdom. After the Bohemian Revolt (of predominantly Protestant aristocracy) which was defeated by the Habsburgs in 1620, the Protestant intellectuals had to leave the country. This emigration together with other consequences of the Thirty Years' War had a negative impact on the further use of the Czech language. In 1627, Czech and German became official languages of the Kingdom of Bohemia and in the 18th century German became dominant in Bohemia and Moravia, especially among the upper classes.[17]\\r\\nThe modern standard Czech language originates in standardization efforts of the 18th century.[18] By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty.[19] Changes include the morphological shift of  to ej and  to  (although  survives for some uses) and the merging of  and the former ej.[20] Sometime before the 18th century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /?/ which survives in Slovak.[21]\\r\\nWith the beginning of the national revival of the mid-18th century, Czech historians began to emphasize their people's accomplishments from the 15th through the 17th centuries, rebelling against the Counter-Reformation (the Habsburg re-catholization efforts which had denigrated Czech and other non-Latin languages).[22] Czech philologists studied sixteenth-century texts, advocating the return of the language to high culture.[23] This period is known as the Czech National Revival[24] (or Renaissance).[23]\\r\\nDuring the national revival, in 1809 linguist and historian Josef Dobrovsky released a German-language grammar of Old Czech entitled Ausfhrliches Lehrgeb?ude der b?hmischen Sprache (Comprehensive Doctrine of the Bohemian Language). Dobrovsky had intended his book to be descriptive, and did not think Czech had a realistic chance of returning as a major language. However, Josef Jungmann and other revivalists used Dobrovsky's book to advocate for a Czech linguistic revival.[24] Changes during this time included spelling reform (notably,  in place of the former j and j in place of g), the use of t (rather than ti) to end infinitive verbs and the non-capitalization of nouns (which had been a late borrowing from German).[21] These changes differentiated Czech from Slovak.[25] Modern scholars disagree about whether the conservative revivalists were motivated by nationalism or considered contemporary spoken Czech unsuitable for formal, widespread use.[24]\\r\\nAdherence to historical patterns was later relaxed and standard Czech adopted a number of features from Common Czech (a widespread, informal register), such as leaving some proper nouns undeclined. This has resulted in a relatively high level of homogeneity among all varieties of the language.[26]\\r\\nIn 2005 and 2007, Czech was spoken by about 10 million residents of the Czech Republic.[17][27] A Eurobarometer survey conducted from January to March 2012 found that the first language of 98 percent of Czech citizens was Czech, the third-highest in the European Union (behind Greece and Hungary).[28]\\r\\nCzech, the official language of the Czech Republic (a member of the European Union since 2004), is one of the EU's official languages and the 2012 Eurobarometer survey found that Czech was the foreign language most often used in Slovakia.[28] Economist Jonathan van Parys collected data on language knowledge in Europe for the 2012 European Day of Languages. The five countries with the greatest use of Czech were the Czech Republic (98.77 percent), Slovakia (24.86 percent), Portugal (1.93 percent), Poland (0.98 percent) and Germany (0.47 percent).[29]\\r\\nCzech speakers in Slovakia primarily live in cities. Since it is a recognised minority language in Slovakia, Slovak citizens who speak only Czech may communicate with the government in their language to the extent that Slovak speakers in the Czech Republic may do so.[30]\\r\\nImmigration of Czechs from Europe to the United States occurred primarily from 1848 to 1914. Czech is a Less Commonly Taught Language in U.S. schools, and is taught at Czech heritage centers. Large communities of Czech Americans live in the states of Texas, Nebraska and Wisconsin.[31] In the 2000 United States Census, Czech was reported as the most-common language spoken at home (besides English) in Valley, Butler and Saunders Counties, Nebraska and Republic County, Kansas. With the exception of Spanish (the non-English language most commonly spoken at home nationwide), Czech was the most-common home language in over a dozen additional counties in Nebraska, Kansas, Texas, North Dakota and Minnesota.[32] As of 2009, 70,500 Americans spoke Czech as their first language (49th place nationwide, behind Turkish and ahead of Swedish).[33]\\r\\nThe modern written standard is directly based on the standardization during the Czech National Revival in the 1830s, significantly influenced by Josef Jungmann's CzechÿGerman dictionary published during 1834ÿ1839. Jungmann used vocabulary of the Bible of Kralice (1579ÿ1613) period and of the language used by his contemporaries. He borrowed words not present in Czech from other Slavic languages or created neologisms.[34]\\r\\nStandard Czech contains ten basic vowel phonemes, and three more found only in loanwords. They are /a/, /?/, /?/, /o/, and /u/, their long counterparts /a?/, /??/, /i?/, /o?/ and /u?/, and three diphthongs, /ou?/, /au?/ and /?u?/. The latter two diphthongs and the long /o?/ are exclusive to loanwords.[35] Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed.[36] Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as English).[37]\\r\\nVoiced consonants with unvoiced counterparts are unvoiced at the end of a word before a pause, and in consonant clusters voicing assimilation occurs, which matches voicing to the following consonant. The unvoiced counterpart of /?/ is /x/.[38]\\r\\nCzech consonants are categorized as \\"hard\\", \\"neutral\\" or \\"soft\\":\\r\\nThis distinction describes the declension patterns of nouns, which is based on the category of a noun's ending consonant. Hard consonants may not be followed by i or  in writing, or soft ones by y or y (except in loanwords such as kilogram).[39] Neutral consonants may take either character. Hard consonants are sometimes known as \\"strong\\", and soft ones as \\"weak\\".[40]\\r\\nThe phoneme represented by the letter ? (capital ?) is considered unique to Czech.[41] It represents the raised alveolar non-sonorant trill (IPA: [r?]), a sound somewhere between Czech's r and ? (example: ?\\"?eka\\" (river)?(help{info)),[41] and is present in Dvo?k. In unvoiced environments, /r?/ is realized as its voiceless allophone [r??].[42]\\r\\nThe consonants /r/ and /l/ can be syllabic, acting as syllable nuclei in place of a vowel. Str? prst skrz krk (\\"Stick [your] finger through [your] throat\\") is a well-known Czech tongue twister using only syllabic consonants.[43]\\r\\nConsonants\\r\\nVowels\\r\\nSlavic grammar is fusional; its nouns, verbs, and adjectives are inflected by phonological processes to modify their meanings and grammatical functions, and the easily separable affixes characteristic of agglutinative languages are limited.[44] Slavic inflection is complex and pervasive, inflecting for case, gender and number in nouns and tense, aspect, mood, person and subject number and gender in verbs.[45]\\r\\nParts of speech include adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative words, prepositions, conjunctions and interjections.[46] Adverbs are primarily formed from adjectives by taking the final y or  of the base form and replacing it with e, , or o.[47] Negative statements are formed by adding the affix ne- to the verb of a clause, with one exception: je (he, she or it is) becomes nen.[48]\\r\\nBecause Czech uses grammatical case to convey word function in a sentence (instead of relying on word order, as English does), its word order is flexible. As a pro-drop language, in Czech an intransitive sentence can consist of only a verb; information about its subject is encoded in the verb.[49] Enclitics (primarily auxiliary verbs and pronouns) must appear in the second syntactic slot of a sentence, after the first stressed unit. The first slot must contain a subject and object, a main form of a verb, an adverb or a conjunction (except for the light conjunctions a, \\"and\\", i, \\"and even\\" or ale, \\"but\\").[50]\\r\\nCzech syntax has a subjectÿverbÿobject sentence structure. In practice, however, word order is flexible and used for topicalization and focus. Although Czech has a periphrastic passive construction (like English), colloquial word-order changes frequently produce the passive voice. For example, to change \\"Peter killed Paul\\" to \\"Paul was killed by Peter\\" the order of subject and object is inverted: Petr zabil Pavla (\\"Peter killed Paul\\") becomes \\"Paul, Peter killed\\" (Pavla zabil Petr). Pavla is in the accusative case, the grammatical object (in this case, the victim) of the verb.[51]\\r\\nA word at the end of a clause is typically emphasized, unless an upward intonation indicates that the sentence is a question:[52]\\r\\nIn portions of Bohemia (including Prague), questions such as J pes bagetu? without an interrogative word (such as co, \\"what\\" or kdo, \\"who\\") are intoned in a slow rise from low to high, quickly dropping to low on the last word or phrase.[53]\\r\\nIn modern Czech syntax, adjectives precede nouns,[54] with few exceptions.[55] Relative clauses are introduced by relativizers such as the adjective ktery, analogous to the English relative pronouns \\"which\\", \\"that\\", \\"who\\" and \\"whom\\". As with other adjectives, it is declined into the appropriate case (see Declension below) to match its associated noun, person and number. Relative clauses follow the noun they modify, and the following is a glossed example:[56]\\r\\nEnglish: I want to visit the university that John attends.\\r\\nIn Czech, nouns and adjectives are declined into one of seven grammatical cases. Nouns are inflected to indicate their use in a sentence. A nominativeÿaccusative language, Czech marks subject nouns with nominative case and object nouns with accusative case. The genitive case marks possessive nouns and some types of movement. The remaining cases (instrumental, locative, vocative and dative) indicate semantic relationships, such as secondary objects, movement or position (dative case) and accompaniment (instrumental case). An adjective's case agrees with that of the noun it describes. When Czech children learn their language's declension patterns, the cases are referred to by number:[57]\\r\\nSome Czech grammatical texts order the cases differently, grouping the nominative and accusative (and the dative and locative) together because those declension patterns are often identical; this order accommodates learners with experience in other inflected languages, such as Latin or Russian. This order is nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, instrumental and vocative.[57]\\r\\nSome prepositions require the nouns they modify to take a particular case. The cases assigned by each preposition are based on the physical (or metaphorical) direction, or location, conveyed by it. For example, od (from, away from) and z (out of, off) assign the genitive case. Other prepositions take one of several cases, with their meaning dependent on the case; na means \\"onto\\" or \\"for\\" with the accusative case, but \\"on\\" with the locative.[58]\\r\\nExamples of declension patterns (using prepositions) for a few nouns with adjectives follow. Only one plural example is given, since plural declension patterns are similar across genders.\\r\\nThis is a glossed example of a sentence using several cases:\\r\\nEnglish: I carried the box into the house with my friend.\\r\\nCzech distinguishes three gendersmasculine, feminine, and neuterand the masculine gender is subdivided into animate and inanimate. With few exceptions, feminine nouns in the nominative case end in -a, -e, or -ost; neuter nouns in -o, -e, or -, and masculine nouns in a consonant.[59] Adjectives agree in gender and animacy (for masculine nouns in the accusative or genitive singular and the nominative plural) with the nouns they modify.[60] The main effect of gender in Czech is the difference in noun and adjective declension, but other effects include past-tense verb endings: for example, dlal (he did, or made); dlala (she did, or made) and dlalo (it did, or made).[61]\\r\\nNouns are also inflected for number, distinguishing between singular and plural. Typical of a Slavic language, Czech cardinal numbers one through four allow the nouns and adjectives they modify to take any case, but numbers over five place these nouns and adjectives in the genitive case when the entire expression is in nominative or accusative case. The Czech koruna is an example of this feature; it is shown here as the subject of a hypothetical sentence, and declined as genitive for numbers five and up.[62]\\r\\nNumerical words decline for case and, for numbers one and two, for gender. Numbers one through five are shown below as examples, and have some of the most exceptions among Czech numbers. The number one has declension patterns identical to those of the demonstrative pronoun, to.[63][64]\\r\\nAlthough Czech's grammatical numbers are singular and plural, several residuals of dual forms remain. Some nouns for paired body parts use a historical dual form to express plural in some cases: ruka (hand)ruce (nominative); noha (leg)nohama (instrumental), nohou (genitive/locative); oko (eye)o?i, and ucho (ear)u?i. While two of these nouns are neuter in their singular forms, all plural forms are considered feminine; their gender is relevant to their associated adjectives and verbs.[65] These forms are plural semantically, used for any non-singular count, as in mezi ?ty?ma o?ima (face to face, lit. among four eyes). The plural number paradigms of these nouns are actually a mixture of historical dual and plural forms. For example, nohy (legs; nominative/accusative) is a standard plural form of this type of noun.[66]\\r\\nCzech verb conjugation is less complex than noun and adjective declension because it codes for fewer categories. Verbs agree with their subjects in person (first, second or third) and number (singular or plural), and are conjugated for tense (past, present or future). For example, the conjugated verb mluvme (we speak) is in the present tense and first-person plural; it is distinguished from other conjugations of the infinitive mluvit by its ending, -me.[67]\\r\\nTypical of Slavic languages, Czech marks its verbs for one of two grammatical aspects: perfective and imperfective. Most verbs are part of inflected aspect pairsfor example, koupit (perfective) and kupovat (imperfective). Although the verbs' meaning is similar, in perfective verbs the action is completed and in imperfective verbs it is ongoing. This is distinct from past and present tense,[68] and any Czech verb of either aspect can be conjugated into any of its three tenses.[67] Aspect describes the state of the action at the time specified by the tense.[68]\\r\\nThe verbs of most aspect pairs differ in one of two ways: by prefix or by suffix. In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefixfor example, the imperfective pst (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-.[69] In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodvat.[70] Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action. The verb jt (to go) has the iterative form chodit (to go repeatedly) and the frequentative form chodvat (to go regularly).[71]\\r\\nMany verbs have only one aspect, and verbs describing continual states of beingbyt (to be), chtt (to want), moct (to be able to), le?et (to lie down, to be lying down)have no perfective form. Conversely, verbs describing immediate states of changefor example, othotnt (to become pregnant) and nadchnout se (to become enthusiastic)have no imperfective aspect.[72]\\r\\nAlthough Czech's use of present and future tense is largely similar to that of English, the language uses past tense to represent the English present perfect and past perfect; ona b?ela could mean she ran, she has run or she had run.[73]\\r\\nIn some contexts, Czech's perfective present (which differs from the English present perfect) implies future action; in others, it connotes habitual action.[74] As a result, the language has a proper future tense to minimize ambiguity. The future tense does not involve conjugating the verb describing an action to be undertaken in the future; instead, the future form of byt (as shown in the table at left) is placed before the infinitive (for example, budu jst\\"I will eat\\").[75]\\r\\nThis conjugation is not followed by byt itself, so future-oriented expressions involving nouns, adjectives, or prepositions (rather than verbs) omit byt. \\"I will be happy\\" is translated as Budu ??astny (not Budu byt ??astny).[75]\\r\\nThe infinitive form ends in t (archaically, ti). It is the form found in dictionaries and the form that follows auxiliary verbs (for example, m??u t sly?et\\"I can hear you\\").[76] Czech verbs have three grammatical moods: indicative, imperative and conditional.[77] The imperative mood adds specific endings for each of three person (or number) categories: -?/-i/-ej for second-person singular, -te/-ete/-ejte for second-person plural and -me/-eme/-ejme for first-person plural.[78] The conditional mood is formed with a particle after the past-tense verb. This mood indicates possible events, expressed in English as \\"I would\\" or \\"I wish\\".[79]\\r\\nMost Czech verbs fall into one of five classes, which determine their conjugation patterns. The future tense of byt would be classified as a Class I verb because of its endings. Examples of the present tense of each class and some common irregular verbs follow in the tables below:[80]\\r\\nCzech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet.[81] As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words.[82] The h?ek () is used with certain letters to form new characters: ?, ?, and ?, as well as , , ?, ?, and ? (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (?, an abbreviated h?ek) because of their height.[83] The character ܇ exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.[84]\\r\\nUnlike most European languages, Czech distinguishes vowel length; long vowels are indicated by an acute accent or, occasionally with ?, a ring. Long u is usually written ~ at the beginning of a word or morpheme (~roda, ne~rodny) and ? elsewhere,[85] except for loanwords (sk~tr) or onomatopoeia (b~).[86] Long vowels and  are not considered separate letters in the alphabetical order.[87]\\r\\nCzech typographical features not associated with phonetics generally resemble those of most Latin European languages, including English. Proper nouns, honorifics, and the first letters of quotations are capitalized, and punctuation is typical of other Latin European languages. Writing of ordinal numerals is similar to most European languages. The Czech language uses a decimal comma instead of a decimal point. When writing a long number, spaces between every three numbers (e.g. between hundreds and thousands) may be used for better orientation in handwritten texts, but not in decimal places, like in English. The number 1,234,567.8910 may be written as 1234567,8910 or 1 234 567,8910. Ordinal numbers (1st) use a point as in German (1.). In proper noun phrases (except personal names), only the first word is capitalized (Pra?sky hrad, Prague Castle).[88][89]\\r\\nThe main vernacular of Bohemia is \\"Common Czech\\", based on the dialect of the Prague region. Other Bohemian dialects have become marginalized, while Moravian dialects remain more widespread, with a political movement for Moravian linguistic revival active since the 1990s.\\r\\nThe main Czech vernacular, spoken primarily in and around Prague but also throughout the country, is known as Common Czech (obecn ?e?tina). This is an academic distinction; most Czechs are unaware of the term or associate it with vernacular (or incorrect) Czech.[90] Compared to standard Czech, Common Czech is characterized by simpler inflection patterns and differences in sound distribution.[91]\\r\\nCommon Czech has become ubiquitous in most parts of the Czech Republic since the later 20th century. It is usually defined as an interdialect used in common speech in Bohemia and western parts of Moravia (by about two thirds of all inhabitants of the Czech Republic). Common Czech is not codified, but some of its elements have become adopted in the written standard. Since the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of media influence. Standard Czech is still the norm for politicians, businesspeople and other Czechs in formal situations, but Common Czech is gaining ground in journalism and the mass media.[91]\\r\\nCommon Czech is characterized by quite regular differences from the standard morphology and phonology. These variations are more or less common among all Common Czech speakers:[92]\\r\\nExample of declension (with the comparison with the standard Czech):\\r\\nmlady ?lovk ÿ young man/person, mlad lid ÿ young people, mlady stt ÿ young state, mlad ?ena ÿ young woman, mlad zv?e ÿ young animal\\r\\nApart from the Common Czech vernacular, there remain a variety of other Bohemian dialects, mostly in marginal rural areas. Dialect use began to weaken in the second half of the 20th century, and by the early 1990s regional dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.[94]\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Bohemian dialects:[95]\\r\\nBohemian dialects use a slightly different set of vowel phonemes to standard Czech. The phoneme /??/ is peripheral and is replaced by /i?/, and a second native diphthong /e??/ occurs, usually in places where standard Czech has /i?/.[96]\\r\\nThe Czech dialects spoken in Moravia and Silesia are known as Moravian (morav?tina). In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, \\"Bohemian-Moravian-Slovak\\" was a language citizens could register as speaking (with German, Polish and several others).[97] Of the Czech dialects, only Moravian is distinguished in nationwide surveys by the Czech Statistical Office. As of 2011, 62,908 Czech citizens spoke Moravian as their first language and 45,561 were diglossal (speaking Moravian and standard Czech as first languages).[98]\\r\\nBeginning in the sixteenth century, some varieties of Czech resembled Slovak;[16] the southeastern Moravian dialects, in particular, are sometimes considered dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. These dialects form a continuum between the Czech and Slovak languages,[99] using the same declension patterns for nouns and pronouns and the same verb conjugations as Slovak.[100]\\r\\nThe Czech Statistical Office in 2003 recognized the following Moravian dialects:[95]\\r\\nIn a 1964 textbook on Czech dialectology, B?etislav Koudela used the following sentence to highlight phonetic differences between dialects:[101]\\r\\nCzech and Slovak have been considered mutually intelligible; speakers of either language can communicate with greater ease than those of any other pair of West Slavic languages. Since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia, mutual intelligibility has declined for younger speakers, probably because Czech speakers now experience less exposure to Slovak and vice versa.[102]\\r\\nIn phonetic differences, Czech is characterized by a glottal stop before initial vowels and Slovak by its less-frequent use of long vowels than Czech;[103] however, Slovak has long forms of the consonants r and l when they function as vowels.[104] Phonemic differences between the two languages are generally consistent, typical of two dialects of a language. Grammatically, although Czech (unlike Slovak) has a fully productive vocative case,[103] both languages share a common syntax.[16]\\r\\nOne study showed that Czech and Slovak lexicons differed by 80 percent, but this high percentage was found to stem primarily from differing orthographies and slight inconsistencies in morphological formation;[105] Slovak morphology is more regular (when changing from the nominative to the locative case, Praha becomes Praze in Czech and Prahe in Slovak). The two lexicons are generally considered similar, with most differences found in colloquial vocabulary and some scientific terminology. Slovak has slightly more borrowed words than Czech.[16]\\r\\nThe similarities between Czech and Slovak led to the languages being considered a single language by a group of 19th-century scholars who called themselves \\"Czechoslavs\\" (?echoslovan), believing that the peoples were connected in a way which excluded German Bohemians and (to a lesser extent) Hungarians and other Slavs.[106] During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918ÿ1938), although \\"Czechoslovak\\" was designated as the republic's official language, both Czech and Slovak written standards were used. Standard written Slovak was partially modeled on literary Czech, and Czech was preferred for some official functions in the Slovak half of the republic. Czech influence on Slovak was protested by Slovak scholars, and when Slovakia broke off from Czechoslovakia in 1938 as the Slovak State (which then aligned with Nazi Germany in World War II), literary Slovak was deliberately distanced from Czech. When the Axis powers lost the war and Czechoslovakia reformed, Slovak developed somewhat on its own (with Czech influence); during the Prague Spring of 1968, Slovak gained independence from (and equality with) Czech,[16] due to the transformation of Czechoslovakia from a unitary state to a federation. Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, \\"Czechoslovak\\" has referred to improvised pidgins of the languages which have arisen from the decrease in mutual intelligibility.[107]\\r\\nCzech vocabulary derives primarily from Slavic, Baltic and other Indo-European roots. Although most verbs have Balto-Slavic origins, pronouns, prepositions and some verbs have wider, Indo-European roots.[108] Some loanwords have been restructured by folk etymology to resemble native Czech words (h?bitov, \\"graveyard\\" and listina, \\"list\\").[109]\\r\\nMost Czech loanwords originated in one of two time periods. Earlier loanwords, primarily from German,[110] Greek and Latin,[111] arrived before the Czech National Revival. More recent loanwords derive primarily from English and French,[110] and also from Hebrew, Arabic and Persian. Many Russian loanwords, principally animal names and naval terms, also exist in Czech.[112]\\r\\nAlthough older German loanwords were colloquial, recent borrowings from other languages are associated with high culture.[110] During the nineteenth century, words with Greek and Latin roots were rejected in favor of those based on older Czech words and common Slavic roots; \\"music\\" is muzyka in Polish and ֿ (muzyka) in Russian, but in Czech it is hudba.[111] Some Czech words have been borrowed as loanwords into English and other languagesfor example, robot (from robota, \\"labor\\")[113] and polka (from polka, \\"Polish woman\\" or from \\"p?lka\\" \\"half\\").[114]\\r\\nAccording to Article 1 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\\r\\nCzech: V?ichni lid se rod svobodn a sob rovn co do d?stojnosti a prv.

She won an award for her performance, and the play was also received favourably.[10] In an interview with the Radio Times in 2015 she revealed that her grandmother had named her Jenna after the character of Jenna Wade played by Priscilla Beaulieu Presley in the 80's hit American drama series Dallas.[11]\\r\\nWhile auditioning for drama schools, Coleman landed the part of Jasmine Thomas in Emmerdale in 2005.

The sum is corrected by a factor which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index.[5]\\r\\nIt is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, created by Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the best known of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was originally published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896.[2]\\r\\nThe Industrial portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the close on September 1, 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has consisted of the following 30 major companies:\\r\\nThe components of the DJIA have changed 51 times since its beginning in May 26, 1896. General Electric has had the longest continuous presence on the index, beginning in 1907. More recent changes to the index include the following:\\r\\nIn 1884, Charles Dow composed his first stock average, which contained nine railroads and two industrial companies that appeared in the Customer's Afternoon Letter, a daily two-page financial news bulletin which was the precursor to The Wall Street Journal. On January 2, 1886, the number of stocks represented in what is now the Dow Jones Transportation Average dropped from 14 to 12, as the Central Pacific Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey were removed. Though comprising the same number of stocks, this index contained only one of the original twelve industrials that would eventually form Dow's most famous index.[14]\\r\\nDow calculated his first average purely of industrial stocks on May 26, 1896, creating what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Of the original 12 industrials, only General Electric currently remains part of that index.[15] The other 11 were:[16]\\r\\nWhen it was first published in the mid-1880s, the index stood at a level of 62.76. It reached a peak of 78.38 during the summer of 1890, but ended up hitting its all-time low of 28.48 in the summer of 1896 during the Panic of 1896. Many of the biggest percentage price moves in the Dow occurred early in its history, as the nascent industrial economy matured. The 1900s would see the Dow halt its momentum as it worked its way through two financial crises; the Panic of 1901 and the Panic of 1907. The Dow would remain stuck in a trading range between 53 and 103 points until late 1914. The negativity surrounding the 1906 San Francisco earthquake did little to improve the economic climate.\\r\\nAt the start of the 1910s, the decade would begin with the Panic of 1910ÿ1911 stifling economic growth for a lengthy period of time. History would later take its course on July 30, 1914; as the average stood at a level of 71.42 when a decision was made to close down the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4 percent. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive.[18] Following World War I, the United States would experience another economic downturn, the post-World War I recession. The Dow's performance would remain unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 points at the end of 1919.[19]\\r\\nDuring the 1920s, specifically In 1928, the components of the Dow were increased to 30 stocks near the economic height of that decade, which was nicknamed the Roaring Twenties. This period downplayed the influence of an early 1920s recession plus certain international conflicts such as the Polish-Soviet war, the Irish Civil War, the Turkish War of Independence and the initial phase of the Chinese Civil War. The Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression over the next several years returned the average to its starting point, almost 90% below its peak. By July 8, 1932, following its intra-day low of 40.56, the Dow would end up closing the session at 41.22. The high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, would not be surpassed until 1954, in inflation-adjusted numbers. However, the bottom of the 1929 Crash came just 2? months later on November 13, 1929, when intra-day it was at the 195.35 level, closing slightly higher at 198.69.[20] For the decade, the Dow would end off with a healthy 131.7% gain, from 107.23 points at the beginning of 1920, to a level of 248.48 points at the end of 1929, just before the Crash of 1929.[21]\\r\\nMarked by global instability and the Great Depression, the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war, leading up to catastrophic World War II in 1939. Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936ÿ1939 Spanish Civil War, the 1935ÿ1936 Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939 and the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937. On top of that, the United States dealt with a painful recession in 1937 and 1938 which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt. The largest one-day percentage gain in the index, 15.34%, happened on March 15, 1933, in the depths of the 1930s bear market when the Dow gained 8.26 points to close at 62.10. However, as a whole throughout the Great Depression, the Dow posted some of its worst performances, for a negative return during most of the 1930s for new and old stock market investors. For the decade, the Dow Jones average was down from 248.48 points at the beginning of 1930, to a stable level of 150.24 points at the end of 1939, a loss of about 40%.[22]\\r\\nPost-war reconstruction during the 1940s, along with renewed optimism of peace and prosperity, brought about a 39% surge in the Dow from around the 148 level to 206. The strength in the Dow occurred despite a brief recession in 1949 and other global conflicts which started a short time later including the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War, the Greek Civil War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and the 1948 ArabÿIsraeli War.\\r\\nDuring the 1950s, the Korean War, the Algerian War, the Cold War and other political tensions such as the Cuban Revolution, as well as widespread political and economic changes in Africa during the initial stages of European Decolonization, did not stop the Dow's bullish climb higher. Additionally, the U.S. would also make its way through two grinding recessions; one in 1953 and another in 1958. A 200% increase in the average from a level of 206 to 616 ensued over the course of that decade.\\r\\nThe Dow's bullish behavior began to stall during the 1960s as the U.S. became entangled with foreign political issues such as U.S. military excursions including the Bay of Pigs Invasion involving Cuba, the Vietnam War, the Portuguese Colonial War, the Colombian civil war which the U.S. assisted with short-lived counter-guerrilla campaigns, as well as domestic issues such as the Civil Rights Movement and several influential political assassinations. For the decade though, and despite a mild recession between 1960 and 1961, the average still managed a respectable 30% gain from the 616 level to 800.\\r\\nThe 1970s marked a time of economic uncertainty and troubled relations between the U.S. and certain Middle-Eastern countries. To begin with, the decade started off with the ongoing Recession of 1969ÿ70. Following that, the 1970s Energy Crisis ensued which included the 1973ÿ75 recession, the 1973 Oil Crisis as well as the 1979 energy crisis beginning as a prelude to a disastrous economic climate injected with stagflation; the combination between high unemployment and high inflation. However, on November 14, 1972, the average closed above the 1,000 mark (1,003.16) for the first time, during a brief relief rally in the midst of a lengthy bear market. Between January 1973 and December 1974, the average lost 48% of its value in what became known as the 1973ÿ1974 Stock Market Crash; with the situation being exacerbated by the events surrounding the Yom Kippur War. The index closed at 577.60, on December 4, 1974. During 1976, the index went above 1000 several times, and it closed the year at 1,004.75. Although the Vietnam War ended in 1975, new tensions arose towards Iran surrounding the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Other notable disturbances such as the Lebanese Civil War, the Ethiopian Civil War, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 and the Angolan Civil War which the U.S. and Soviet Union considered critical to the global balance of power, seemed to have had little influence towards the financial markets. Performance-wise for the decade, gains remained virtually flat, rising less than 5% from about the 800 level to 838.\\r\\nThe 1980s decade started with the early 1980s recession. In early 1981, it broke above 1000 several times, but then retreated. The largest one-day percentage drop occurred on Black Monday; October 19, 1987, when the average fell 22.61%. There were no clear reasons given to explain the crash, but program trading may have been a major contributing factor. On October 13, 1989, the Dow stumbled into another downfall, the 1989 Mini-Crash which initiated the collapse of the junk bond market as the Dow registered a loss of almost 7%.\\r\\nFor the decade, the Dow made a 228% increase from the 838 level to 2,753; despite the market crashes, Silver Thursday, an early 1980s recession, the 1980s oil glut, the Japanese asset price bubble and other political distractions such as the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Falklands War, the IranÿIraq War, the Second Sudanese Civil War and the First Intifada in the Middle East. The index had only two negative years, which were in 1981 and 1984.\\r\\nThe 1990s brought on rapid advances in technology along with the introduction of the dot-com era. To start off, the markets contended with the 1990 oil price shock compounded with the effects of the Early 1990s recession and a brief European situation surrounding Black Wednesday. Certain influential foreign conflicts such as the 1991 Soviet coup d'tat attempt which took place as part of the initial stages of the Dissolution of the USSR and the Fall of Communism; the First and Second Chechen Wars, the Persian Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars failed to dampen economic enthusiasm surrounding the ongoing Information Age and the \\"irrational exuberance\\" (a phrase coined by Alan Greenspan) of the Internet Boom. Even the occurrences of the Rwandan Genocide and the Second Congo War, termed as \\"Africa's World War\\" that involved 8 separate African nations which together between the two killed over 5 million people, didn't seem to have any noticeable negative financial impact on the Dow either. Between late 1992 and early 1993, the Dow staggered through the 3,000 level making only modest gains as the Biotechnology sector suffered through the downfall of the Biotech Bubble; as many biotech companies saw their share prices rapidly rise to record levels and then subsequently fall to new all-time lows.\\r\\nOn November 21, 1995, the DJIA closed above the 5,000 level (5,023.55) for the first time. Over the following two years, the Dow would rapidly tower above the 6,000 level during the month of October in 1996, and the 7,000 level in February 1997. On its march higher into record territory, the Dow easily made its way through the 8,000 level in July 1997. However, later in that year during October, the events surrounding the Asian Financial Crisis plunged the Dow into a 554-point loss to a close of 7,161.15; a retrenchment of 7.18% in what became known as the 1997 Mini-Crash. Although internationally there was negativity surrounding the 1998 Russian financial crisis along with the subsequent fallout from the 1998 collapse of the derivatives Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund involving bad bets placed on the movement of the Russian ruble, the Dow would go on to surpass the 9,000 level during the month of April in 1998, making its sentimental push towards the symbolic 10,000 level. On March 29, 1999, the average closed above the 10,000 mark (10,006.78) after flirting with it for two weeks. This prompted a celebration on the trading floor, complete with party hats. The scene at the exchange made front-page headlines on many U.S. newspapers such as The New York Times. On May 3, 1999, the Dow achieved its first close above the 11,000 mark (11,014.70). Total gains for the decade exceeded 315%; from the 2,753 level to 11,497.\\r\\nThe Dow averaged a 5.3% return compounded annually for the 20th century, a record Warren Buffett called \\"a wonderful century\\"; when he calculated that to achieve that return again, the index would need to close at about 2,000,000 by December 2099.[23] During the height of the dot-com era, authors James K. Glassman and Kevin A. Hassett went so far as to publish a book entitled Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market. Their theory was to imply that stocks were still cheap and it was not too late to benefit from rising prices during the Internet boom.\\r\\nCharacterized by fear on the part of newer investors, the uncertainty of the 2000s (decade) brought on a significant bear market. There was indecision on whether the cyclical bull market represented a prolonged temporary bounce or a new long-term trend. Ultimately, there was widespread resignation and disappointment as the lows were revisited, and in some cases, surpassed near the end of the decade.\\r\\nThe fourth largest one-day point drop in DJIA history, and largest at the time, occurred on September 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when the Dow fell 684.81 points, or 7.1%. However, the Dow had been in a downward trend for virtually all of 2001 prior to September 11, losing well over 1000 points between January 2 and September 10, and had lost 187.51 points on September 6, followed by losing 235.4 points on September 7.[24] By the end of that week, the Dow had fallen 1,369.70 points, or 14.3%. However, the Dow began an upward trend shortly after the attacks, and quickly regained all lost ground to close above the 10,000 level for the year.\\r\\nDuring 2002, the average remained subdued without making substantial gains due to the stock market downturn of 2002 as well as the lingering effects of the dot-com bubble. In 2003, the Dow held steady within the 7,000 to 9,000-point level range by the early 2000s recession, the Afghan War and the Iraq War. But by December of that year, the Dow remarkably returned to the 10,000 mark. In October 2006, four years after its bear market low, the DJIA set fresh record theoretical, intra-day, daily close, weekly, and monthly highs for the first time in almost seven years, closing above the 12,000 level for the first time on the 19th anniversary of Black Monday (1987). On February 27, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.3% (415.30 points), its biggest point drop since 2001. The initial drop was caused by a global sell-off after Chinese stocks experienced a mini-crash, yet by April 25, the Dow passed the 13,000 level in trading and closed above that milestone for the first time. On July 19, 2007, the average passed the 14,000 level, completing the fastest 1,000-point advance for the index since 1999. One week later, a 450-point intra-day loss, owing to turbulence in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market and the soaring value of the yuan,[25][26] initiated another correction falling below the 13,000 mark, about 10% from its highs.\\r\\nOn October 9, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high of 14,164.53. Two days later on October 11, the Dow traded at an intra-day level high of 14,198.10,[27] a mark which would not be matched until March 2013.[28] In what would normally take many years to accomplish; numerous reasons were cited for the Dow's extremely rapid rise from the 11,000 level in early 2006, to the 14,000 level in late 2007. They included future possible takeovers and mergers, healthy earnings reports particularly in the tech sector, and moderate inflationary numbers; fueling speculation the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates.\\r\\nOn September 15, 2008, a wider financial crisis became evident when Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy along with the economic effect of record high oil prices which reached almost $150 per barrel two months earlier. When opening that morning, it immediately lost 300 points and overall the DJIA lost more than 500 points for only the sixth time in history, returning to its mid-July lows below the 11,000 level. A series of \\"bailout\\" packages, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, proposed and implemented by the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury, as well as FDIC-sponsored bank mergers, did not prevent further losses. After nearly six months of extreme volatility during which the Dow experienced its largest one-day point loss, largest daily point gain, and largest intra-day range (more than 1,000 points), the index closed at a new twelve-year low of 6,547.05 on March 9, 2009 (after an intra-day low of 6,469.95[29] during the March 6 session), its lowest close since April 1997, and had lost 20% of its value in only six weeks.\\r\\nTowards the latter half of 2009, the average rallied towards the 10,000 level amid optimism that the Late-2000s (decade) Recession, the United States Housing Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008ÿ2009, were easing and possibly coming to an end. For the decade, the Dow saw a rather substantial pullback for a negative return from the 11,497 level to 10,428, a loss of a little over 9%.\\r\\nDuring the early part of the 2010s, aided somewhat by the loose monetary policy practiced by the Federal Reserve, the Dow made a notable rally attempt, though with significant volatility due to growing global concerns such as the 2010 European sovereign debt crisis, the Dubai debt crisis, and the United States debt ceiling crisis. On May 6, 2010, the index lost around 400 points over the day, then just after 2:30?pm EDT, it lost about 600 points in just a few minutes, and gained the last amount back about as quickly. The intra-day change at the lowest point was 998.50 points, representing an intra-day loss of 9.2%. The event, during which the Dow bottomed out at 9,869 before recovering to end with a 3.2% daily loss at 10,520.32, became known as the 2010 Flash Crash.[30] The index closed the half-year at 9,774.02 for a loss of 7.7%.[31]\\r\\nIn the midst of the decade, the Dow rallied its way above the peak from October 2007. On May 3, 2013, the Dow surpassed the 15,000 mark for the first time before towering above the next few millenary milestones thanks to commendable economic reports.[32][33][34] The index closed 2014 at 17,823.07 for a gain of 71% for the five years before progress became minimal the next year.[35] However, the overwhelming economic factors exhibited in 2015 caused the Dow to plunge into correction territory for the first time since 2011.[citation needed] By October, the Dow had exited correction rallying 14% from its August lows, but failed to hit a record high set back in May.[citation needed] In November and December, the Dow continued to retreat from the 14% rally in October, leading some to call it a bear market.[36][37] This led to the Dow closing at 17,425.03 for 2015, the first annual loss since 2008.[38] After nearly 14 months since the last record close, the Dow finally achieved a fresh new, central-bank debt fueled record close on July 20, 2016 at 18,595.03 along with an intraday high of 18,622.01.[39]\\r\\nDuring the late part of the 2010s, despite anticipations of post-election selloffs, the Dow rallied significantly after Donald Trump was elected President. On January 25, 2017, the Dow hit a record high of 20,000, an increase of 1,667 points since his election in November 2016.[40] Throughout the course of the rest of 2017 and January 2018, the Dow skyrocketed past a few millenary milestones, including the symbolic 25,000 on January 4, 2018.[41] The current record high of 26,616.71 was achieved on Jan. 26, 2018. However, on February 2, 2018, the Dow suffered its biggest loss since Brexit on June 24, 2016.[42] As volatility made its return for next week, the largest intraday point drop of 1,597.08 points and largest closing point drop of 1,175.21 points were both set on February 5, 2018 although percentage changes were not as extreme as some past stock market crashes.[43]\\r\\nInvesting in the DJIA is made widely accessible in equities through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as in derivatives through option contracts and futures contracts.\\r\\nSeveral ETFs follow the Dow Jones Industrial Average, including with short or leverage strategies.[44] The biggest has assets under management in the tens of billions dollars as of 2017.[45]\\r\\nDue to the advent of pre-market trading, the ETFs provide a very accurate opening value for the average.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the derivatives market, the CME Group through its subsidiaries the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), issues Futures Contracts; the E-mini Dow ($5) Futures (YM), which track the average and trade on their exchange floors respectively. Trading is typically carried out in an Open Outcry auction, or over an electronic network such as CME's Globex platform. Dow Futures is one of the most important premarket tool and reflect the mood in which DJIA will open.\\r\\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) issues Options Contracts on the Dow through the root symbol DJX in combination with long-term expiration options called DJX LEAPS. There are also options on the various ETFs; Performance ETFs, Inverse Performance ETFs, 2x Performance ETFs, Inverse 2x Performance ETFs, 3x Performance ETFs, and Inverse 3x Performance ETFs.\\r\\nTo calculate the DJIA, the sum of the prices of all 30 stocks is divided by a divisor, the Dow Divisor. The divisor is adjusted in case of stock splits, spinoffs or similar structural changes, to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the DJIA. Early on, the initial divisor was composed of the original number of component companies; which made the DJIA at first, a simple arithmetic average. The present divisor, after many adjustments, is less than one (meaning the index is larger than the sum of the prices of the components). That is:\\r\\nwhere p are the prices of the component stocks and d is the Dow Divisor.\\r\\nEvents such as stock splits or changes in the list of the companies composing the index alter the sum of the component prices. In these cases, in order to avoid discontinuity in the index, the Dow Divisor is updated so that the quotations right before and after the event coincide:\\r\\nThe Dow Divisor was 0.14523396877348 on September 1, 2017.[46] Presently, every $1 change in price in a particular stock within the average equates to a 6.885 (or 1  0.14523396877348) point movement.\\r\\nWith the current inclusion of only 30 stocks, critics such as Ric Edelman argue that the DJIA is not a very accurate representation of overall market performance. Still, it is the most cited and most widely recognized of the stock market indices.[47][48] Additionally, the DJIA is criticized for being a price-weighted average, which gives higher-priced stocks more influence over the average than their lower-priced counterparts, but takes no account of the relative industry size or market capitalization of the components. For example, a $1 increase in a lower-priced stock can be negated by a $1 decrease in a much higher-priced stock, even though the lower-priced stock experienced a larger percentage change. In addition, a $1 move in the smallest component of the DJIA has the same effect as a $1 move in the largest component of the average. For example, during SeptemberÿOctober 2008, former component AIG's reverse split-adjusted stock price collapsed from $22.76 on September 8 to $1.35 on October 27; contributing to a roughly 3,000-point drop in the index.[49]\\r\\nAs of January 2018, Boeing and Goldman Sachs are among the highest priced stocks in the average and therefore have the greatest influence on it. Alternately, Pfizer and General Electric are among the lowest priced stocks in the average and have the least amount of sway in the price movement.[50] Many critics of the DJIA recommend the float-adjusted market-value weighted S&P 500 or the Wilshire 5000, the latter of which includes all U.S. equity securities, as better indicators of the U.S. stock market.\\r\\nA study between the correlation of components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared with the movement of the index finds that the correlation is higher in a time period where the average recedes and goes down. The correlation is lowest in a time when the average is flat or rises a modest amount.[51]","input":"What is the oldest company in the dow jones index?"},{"output":"Christopher Pike","context":"Christopher Pike is a character in the Star Trek science fiction franchise. He was portrayed by Jeffrey Hunter in the original Star Trek pilot episode, \\"The Cage\\", as captain of the USS?Enterprise. The pilot was rejected, and the character was dropped during development of the second pilot when Hunter decided that he did not want to continue with the series.[1][2] Sean Kenney portrayed Pike in new footage filmed for a subsequent Star Trek episode, \\"The Menagerie\\", which also re-uses original footage featuring Hunter from \\"The Cage\\". Bruce Greenwood portrays Pike in the 2009 film Star Trek and its 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to dialogue in The Cage, he is from the city of Mojave on Earth and once owned a horse named Tango.\\r\\nPike is the second captain of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 and the first to be shown in Star Trek canon. The animated Star Trek series reveals that Captain Robert April predated Pike, and printed Star Trek fiction and reference books also identify April as Pike's predecessor.[4][5] Pike took command of the USS Enterprise in the year 2252, at the age of 38, taking over command from Robert April, who commanded the Enterprise for nine years.\\r\\nAt the beginning of \\"The Cage\\", set in the year 2254, Pike and his crew are recuperating from a mission to Rigel VII during which several members of the landing party were killed by the inhabitants.The incident filled Pike with so much guilt that he is considering resigning his commission.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Enterprise is en route to Vega Colony to drop off wounded crew members when it receives a distress call from the survey vessel SS Columbia, lost eighteen years previously. Pike orders the ship diverted to Talos IV to rescue survivors.\\r\\nPike soon learns that all but one of the survivors are illusions created by the Talosians in order to lure the Enterprise crew to Talos IV. The Talosians make every effort to provide sexual fantasies that they hope will appeal to Pike, using Vina, the only real Columbia survivor, as the object of desire. After Pike escapes from his prison cell with the aid of his first officer, Number One, and Yeoman J.M. Colt, the Talosians reveal, to Pike, Vina's real appearance as a disfigured older woman. The Talosians saved her life after the Columbia crashed, but they had no guide on how to repair a human body. Pike requests that the Talosians restore her illusion of beauty and the Enterprise leaves Talos IV.\\r\\nAt some point prior to The Menagerie, Pike is promoted to fleet captain. He is severely injured while rescuing several cadets from a baffle plate rupture on board a J-class training vessel, the delta ray radiation leaving him paralyzed, unable to speak, badly scarred, and using a brainwave-operated wheelchair for mobility. His only means of communicating is through a light on the chair: one flash meaning \\"yes\\" and two flashes indicating \\"no\\".\\r\\nIn The Menagerie, the Enterprise, now under the command of Captain James T. Kirk, travels to Starbase 11. Spock, who had served with Pike for \\"eleven years, four months, and five days\\", makes clandestine arrangements to take Pike back to Talos IV, despite travel to Talos IV being the only criminal offense still punishable by death in Starfleet. Spock undergoes court-martial, with his evidence presented during the trial being footage from \\"The Cage\\". At the two-part episode's conclusion, it is revealed that the entire procedure was a Talosian-generated illusion to ensure that the Enterprise reached Talos. The Talosians invite Captain Pike to spend the remainder of his life among them, \\"unfettered by his natural body\\", which was the entire purpose of Spock's actions. Pike accepts the offer and Spock, now cleared of all charges, sees him off. The Talosians then show Captain Kirk an image of Pike in perfect health and reunited with Vina (another scene from \\"The Cage\\").\\r\\nPike is referenced in the episode \\"Mirror, Mirror\\". An alternate-universe version of Captain Kirk reportedly assassinated Pike to become captain of the ISS Enterprise (the Mirror Universe version of the USS Enterprise).\\r\\nIn the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"The Most Toys\\", the name Pike can be seen briefly on the side of the shuttlecraft Lt.

In the film, Pike encourages a young, directionless James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to follow in the footsteps of his hero father and enlist in Starfleet.[6] Pike is the first Captain of the USS Enterprise, with Kirk on board as a stowaway. During the Battle of Vulcan, Pike is taken prisoner by Nero (Eric Bana) and tortured for information about Earth's defenses. He is later rescued by Kirk, whom Pike also manages to save from an attacking Reman (a close cousin of the Romulan race), despite his wounds. At the end of the film, Pike is promoted to the rank of admiral and uses a wheelchair. Unlike his counterpart in The Menagerie, however, Pike still retains the ability to speak and to use his upper body. He proudly yields command of the Enterprise to Kirk while he recovers from his injuries, stating that Kirk's father would be proud of his actions.\\r\\nGreenwood reprised his role as Pike in the next film, Star Trek Into Darkness. In the film, Pike has partially recovered from the trauma Nero inflicted, and uses a cane rather than a wheelchair.[7] After Kirk violates the Prime Directive to rescue Spock (Zachary Quinto), Pike briefly retakes command of the Enterprise and warns Kirk that the Admiralty is threatening to put him back into the Academy. Pike confronts Kirk about his reckless behavior and how his own actions can get those nearest to him killed. Despite his anger at Kirk, however, Pike retains him as his First Officer, sparing him from having to return to the Academy. He later explains to Kirk that he still believes in him and that he also sees a \\"greatness\\" behind his recklessness. During a meeting with the Starfleet commanders, including veteran Admiral Marcus and Captain Kirk, Pike is killed in a terrorist attack on Starfleet by John Harrison. Pike's death incites a desire for revenge in Kirk, who seeks to hunt Harrison down, which nearly brings the Federation into a full-scale war with the Klingons. It is revealed that \\"John Harrison\\" is an alias, and Harrison's true identity is Khan Noonien Singh. Khan reveals a secret agenda of Admiral Marcus to militarize Starfleet via war with the Klingons and the use of the huge Dreadnought class starship, USS Vengeance, which was designed by Khan. At the end of the film, a memorial service is held for Pike and all of the other people who died as a result of Admiral Marcus' and Khan's actions. Pike's death also deeply affects Kirk and Spock, Kirk because of their close relationship and Spock because he'd been mind-melding with Pike as he died and felt his death.\\r\\nPike has significant roles in the Pocket Books novels Enterprise: The First Adventure (Vonda N. McIntyre, 1986), Final Frontier (Diane Carey, 1988), Vulcan's Glory (D. C.

The earliest issues lead up to the events seen in \\"The Cage\\", which was retold from Yeoman Colt's point of view. Although extremely popular, the comic series ended on a cliffhanger when Marvel lost the Star Trek license rights.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn this issue, the Enterprise tries to return home to Earth only to find itself around Talos IV. They discover that the Klingons have gone to the planet reasoning anything that scared the Federation enough to maintain the death penalty could be used as a weapon. While on the surface they also discover two Klingons torturing Pike, who is back in his chair due to the Klingons having partially mastered the Talosian's mind powers. One of the Klingons then tortures the crew of the Enterprise by making them live their worst fears. Kirk, forced to relive the death of Edith Keeler, goes berserk with rage and breaks the illusion. Kirk then beats the Klingon tormenting them to death with his bare hands. The crew quickly free the Talosians, who mentally imprison the Klingons in illusions of peaceful, tranquil settings as they purge their memories of Talos IV. The crew returns home with Pike remaining on Talos IV to continue his illusionary life.\\r\\nIn the Paramount-licensed Star Trek comic book series published by Marvel Comics, Starfleet Academy, Nog and some fellow cadets encounter a solid image of Pike on Talos IV.[citation needed]\\r\\nCaptain's Log: Pike published by IDW details the events leading up to and including Pike becoming disabled from the baffle plate rupture aboard the USS Exeter (NCC-1788) under the watch of Captain Colt, Pike's former yeoman on the Enterprise.

The Philippines is also home to Tawi-Tawi's Blue-winged racket-tail, the most endangered parrot species in Southeast Asia, and the Calayan rail, the most endangered rail species in the world, found only on a small island in the Babuyan Group of Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the EDGE of Existence Programme of the Zoological Society of London, the Philippines has the highest bird endemic in the world. Six of the world's 50 most evolutionary distinct and globally endangered (EDGE) species are found in the Philippines. These species are the Philippine Eagle (15th place, the highest from the Philippines), Spoon-billed Sandpiper (#19), Black-hooded Coucal (#22), Sulu Hornbill (#41), Cebu Brown-dove (#46), Rufous-headed Hornbill (#50). Previously, in 2013, when the list was up to 100, the various bleeding heart doves species found only in the Philippines and the Philippine Cockatoo was also in the list.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are more than 111 species of Amphibians and 270 species of Reptiles in the Philippines, 80% of the Amphibians are endemic and 70% of the Reptiles of the Philippines are also endemic.[5] It is believed that there are not more than 14 of the 114 total species of snakes in the country are venomous. Several species of reptiles and amphibians remains undiscovered. Unfortunately, several of these species were believed to have disappeared without ever being discovered.[2] The Philippines also has 50-60 endemic Platymantis frog species, by far the most diverse genus of amphibians in the archipelago.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe endemic freshwater crocodile Crocodylus mindorensis is critically endangered and is considered the most threatened crocodilian in the world. In 1982, wild populations were estimated to be only 500-1,000 individuals; by 1995 a mere 100 crocodiles remained living in the wild. The recent discovery of a population of this species in the Sierra Madre mountains of Luzon brings new hope for its conservation. Projects were being made in an effort to save the crocodiles. The Crocodile Rehabilitation, Observance and Conservation (CROC) Project of the Mabuwaya Foundation is active in carrying out such projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther unique and threatened reptiles include Gray's monitor and the Philippine forest turtle. There are two newly discovered species of frugivorous monitor lizard, the Panay monitor lizard from the island of Panay and Northern Sierra Madre forest monitor from north east Luzon, there are only three species of monitor lizards that are specialized frugivores.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Philippines has about 330 freshwater fish,[7] including nine endemic genera and more than 65 endemic species, many of which are confined to single lakes. An example is Sardinella tawilis, a freshwater sardine found only in Taal Lake. Unfortunately, Lake Lanao, in Mindanao, seems to  be experiencing the country's most catastrophic extinction event, with nearly all of the lakes endemic fish species now almost certainly extinct, primarily due to the introduction of tilapia, which is an edible fish, for the expansion of the fishing industry. Other exotic species were also introduced to the lake.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 70 percent of the Philippines nearly 21,000 recorded insect species are found only in the country. In addition about one-third of the 915 butterflies found here are endemic to the country, and over 110 of the more than 130 species of tiger beetle are found nowhere else. One of the largest butterflies in the world and the largest in the Philippines, the Magellan birdwing can be found here. The largest moth, the Atlas moth, can be found in the Philippines.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCrustaceans are very diverse in the archipelago. More than 50 species of freshwater crabs (in genera Carpomon, Insulamon, Isolapotamon, Mainitia, Mindoron, Ovitamon, Parathelphusa and Sundathelphusa) are known from the Philippines and all are endemic to the country.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the very least, one-third of the more than 9,250 vascular plant species native to the Philippines are endemic. There are, however, no plant families endemic to the country. The families of gingers, begonias, gesneriads, orchids, pandans, palms, and dipterocarps are particularly high in endemic species. For example, two-thirds of the 150 species of palms present in the country are found nowhere else in the world. 700 of the 1,000 species of orchids found in the Philippines are unique to its wildlife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe broad lowland and hill rain forests of the Philippines, which are mostly gone today, were dominated by at least 45 species of dipterocarps. These massive trees were abundant to up to 1,000 meters above sea level. Other important tree species here include giant figs, which provide food for fruit bats, parrots, and monkeys, and Pterocarpus indicus, which like the dipterocarps, is valued for its timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few species of Rafflesia are found in the Philippines, one of them being Rafflesia philippensis.","input":"How many animal species are there in the philippines?"},{"output":"Grand Theft Auto V","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto (GTA) is an action-adventure video game series created by David Jones and Mike Dailly;[2] the later titles of which were created by brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term used in the US for motor vehicle theft.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost games in the series are set in fictional locales modelled on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami and the state of California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series focuses around many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3] With its British origin, the series contains satire and humour.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish video game developer DMA Design began the series in 1997. As of  2014[update], it has eleven stand-alone games and four expansion packs. The third chronological title, Grand Theft Auto III, is considered a landmark title, as it brought the series to a 3D setting and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles would follow and build upon the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and receive significant acclaim. They subsequently influenced many other open world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 250 million units,[5] making it the fourth-highest selling video game franchise of all time, behind Nintendo's Mario and Pokmon franchises,[6] and Tetris.[7] In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[8] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[4] However, the series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is split into separate fictional universes, named after the primary level of graphics capability used in each era.[9] The original Grand Theft Auto, its expansions and its sequel are considered the \\"2D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels are considered the \\"3D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto IV, its expansions and Grand Theft Auto V are considered the \\"HD universe\\". Each universe is considered separate with only brands, place names and background characters shared between them.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto, the first game in the series, was released for Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS in October 1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1998 and the Game Boy Color in 1999. Grand Theft Auto 2 was released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, later receiving ports on the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PlayStation 2 also featured three instalments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms; a deal between Take-Two Interactive and Sony Computer Entertainment resulted in their timed exclusivity on the PlayStation 2, before receiving ports to Microsoft Windows and the Xbox.[13] The 2001 title Grand Theft Auto III moved away from the two-dimension (2D) graphics used in the first two games to three-dimension (3D) computer graphics[14] Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was published in 2002, and was the first to feature a speaking protagonist, voiced by Ray Liotta.[15] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004, introduced various new elements, including character customisation and a large map encompassing three cities and surrounding rural area.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo main instalments were published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV focused on realism and detail, removing various customisation features, while adding an online multiplayer mode.[17] Grand Theft Auto V, published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists.[18] It was released to massive financial success, breaking multiple records.[19] It was later re-released with various enhancements, in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto has spawned numerous additional games and expansion packs. In 1999, the original game received two expansion packs: Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 and Grand Theft Auto: London 1961.[12] Grand Theft Auto Advance, released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance, featured a top-down perspective. Three games were released for the PlayStation Portable. The 2005 game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto III, while the 2006 game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is a prequel to Vice City; both games were later ported to the PlayStation 2. In 2009, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars was released for the Nintendo DS, and later ported to the PlayStation Portable.[21] In 2009, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony were released for the Xbox 360 as expansion packs to Grand Theft Auto IV; a \\"strategic alliance\\" between Rockstar and Microsoft resulted in the timed exclusivity. They were later released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows as part of a compilation, titled Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous titles in the series have received ports to mobile devices. Chinatown Wars was released for iOS in 2010 and for Android and Fire OS in 2014.[23] For their tenth anniversaries, Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City were both re-released for iOS and Android in 2011 and 2012, respectively.[24][25] In 2013, San Andreas was ported to iOS, Android & Windows Phone and RT?;[26] the mobile port was later re-released for Xbox 360 in 2014, the year of the game's tenth anniversary,[27] and the following year for PlayStation 3.[28] In 2015 Liberty City Stories was ported to iOS, Android & Fire OS.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto Double Pack was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It includes Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City.[31] Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is a compilation of III, Vice City, and San Andreas. The compilation was first released in 2005 for the Xbox.[32] Later it was released for the PlayStation 2, Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 4.[33][34][35][36] The Trilogy also served as the revised package for San Andreas, which had to be pulled from shelves due to the controversial Hot Coffee mod.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for Grand Theft Auto IV.  It contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc. It was released on 29 October 2009 for the Xbox 360 and on 13 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. Microsoft added Episodes from Liberty City to its backwards compatibility list for Xbox One platforms in February 2017.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has been expanded into various other formats. Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto, a book written by David Kushner chronicling the development of the series, was published in 2012.[39] In March 2015, BBC Two announced The Gamechangers, a 90-minute docudrama based on the creation of Grand Theft Auto,[40] Directed by Owen Harris and written by James Wood, the drama stars Daniel Radcliffe as Rockstar president Sam Houser and Bill Paxton as disbarred attorney Jack Thompson.[41] In May 2015, Rockstar filed a lawsuit against the BBC for trademark infringement, stating that they had no involvement with the development of the film and had unsuccessfully tried to contact the BBC to resolve the matter.[42] It first aired on 15 September 2015 on BBC Two.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, McFarland & Company published The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto.[44] Compiled by Nate Garrelts, the 264-page book is a collection of essays regarding the Grand Theft Auto series, to help audiences better understand the games and to make a point about due diligence of game criticism. The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the controversies surrounding the series, while the second half takes a theoretical look at the games absent of the controversy.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA planned film adaptation of the series is unable to proceed because of a lawsuit by Roger Corman, who produced Grand Theft Auto. In 2017, Corman said, \\"I actually sued the video game manufacturer who flat-out stole the idea. We settled out of court and they gave me some money. I retain the right to remake it, but the way it was actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy. My lawyers are actually studying that contract to make certain that I have a clear title to remake my picture, and I will remake Grand Theft Auto.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach game in this series allows the player to take on the role of a criminal in the big city, typically an individual who plans to rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also involved in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn later titles, notably those released after Grand Theft Auto 2, the player is given a more developed storyline in which they are forced to overcome an unfortunate event (e.g., being betrayed and left for dead), which serves as motivation for the character to advance up the criminal ladder and ultimately leads to the triumph of the character by the end of the storyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series belongs to a genre of free-roaming role-playing video games called open world games, and grants a large amount of freedom to the player. Traditional action games are structured as a single track series of levels with linear gameplay, but in Grand Theft Auto the player can determine the missions that they want to undertake, and their relationship with various characters are changed based on these choices. Influenced by the earlier game Turbo Esprit,[47][48] the cities of the games can be roamed freely at any point in the game, and are examples of open world video game environments which offer accessible buildings with minor missions in addition to the main storyline. There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot. These missions are required to complete in order to unlock new areas in the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III and subsequent games have more voice acting and radio stations, which simulate driving to music with disc jockeys, radio personalities, commercials, talk radio, pop music, and American culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of vehicles in an explorable urban environment provides a basic simulation of a working city, complete with pedestrians who generally obey traffic signals. Further details are used to flesh out an open-ended atmosphere that has been used in several other games, such as The Simpsons: Hit & Run, which has less emphasis on crime or violence, and Lego City Undercover, which reverses the roles of police officer and criminal, although the player goes undercover in gangs for a portion of the game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminal activities in Grand Theft Auto games do not go unnoticed by the police. As the player engages in these in-game illegal activities, they may gain a \\"wanted level\\", represented by a maximum of five or six stars. A small crime, such as running over a non-player character, may create a one star wanted level situation, while shooting an officer may earn more stars. As the number of stars increase, the amount and strength of the response will increase; a single star might have a few police cars chase after the player, while at 5 or 6 stars, tanks and attack helicopters will chase down the player. Many in-game missions will automatically give the player a wanted level after completing a certain event which they must then get rid of before the mission is complete. Often, trying to keep away from the police while wanted will cause the player to gain even higher wanted levels. The player can remove their character's wanted level by avoiding detection or spending in-game money at specific locations to elude the police (such as a mod shop to repaint their car). Alternatively, if the player-character dies, they will respawn at a hospital and the wanted level will be removed, though the player may lose money, guns, and other benefits they had before being chased. The \\"wanted level\\" gameplay concept has become common in other GTA Clones and similar open world games.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is set in a fictional version of the world, in a number of different time periods. The original Grand Theft Auto introduced three main cities: Liberty City, based upon New York City, Vice City, based upon Miami, and San Andreas, based upon mostly parts of California. In the first Grand Theft Auto game, San Andreas was based on San Francisco and parts of Las Vegas. Expansion packs later set the game in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second entry in the franchise, Grand Theft Auto 2, set the game in the future in a locale named \\"Anywhere City\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent games in the series have re-imagined and expanded upon the original locales. Grand Theft Auto III is set in a different rendition of Liberty City only loosely based on New York City.[49] A revised Vice City and San Andreas are depicted in Vice City and San Andreas, respectively, the latter of which takes the form of an entire state, instead of a single city. The state of San Andreas is based on the states of California and Nevada, and consists of three major cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). Surrounding towns and areas of desert, water, woodland, and countryside lie between the three cities. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City is also briefly featured during one mission.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, originally released for PlayStation Portable handheld console and later re-issued for other consoles, are set in the previous depictions of their respective eponymous cities, but in different decades. The maps for the two cities remain the same, with some differences in terms of buildings and geography to reflect the different time periods.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto IV and its subsequent expansion packs The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are set in a third revision of Liberty City, set in 2008, which is a closer analogue to New York City and its boroughs than the GTA III version.[50] Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is also set in this version of Liberty City, although the Alderney portion of the map is not present.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, is set in a revised depiction of southern San Andreas that only features Los Santos (Los Angeles) to the south and the rural Blaine County to the north.[52] It includes revised landmarks such as the \\"Vinewood\\" sign (instead of Hollywood), Rockford Hills (instead of Beverly Hills), Del Perro Pier (instead of Santa Monica Pier), Los Santos International Airport (LSX) (instead of LAX), Los Santos Golf Club (instead of Los Angeles Country Club.), and Galileo Observatory (instead of Griffith Observatory). The game also features the town of Ludendorff in the fictional state of North Yankton. Los Angeles was extensively researched for Grand Theft Auto V. The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians and captured around 250,000 photos and hours of video footage during these visits.[53] Since the release of the game, hundreds of in-game buildings have been identified as being based on real-world landmarks.[54] The New Yorker's Sam Sweet notes that, with sales of game reaching thirteen million copies, \\"there will be more people living in the imaginary state of Los Santos than in the real city on which it was modelled.\\"[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto V, Los Santos and the state of San Andreas are depicted as being on an island an undetermined distance from the US mainland. In both games it is possible to circumnavigate the state by boat. Similarly, the versions of Liberty City and Alderney in Grand Theft Auto IV and expansion packs are also completely located on islands, as is Vice City. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City however, while mostly island, is connected to mainland on its Northwest corner (a region the player cannot navigate).[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly the expansion packs for the original Grand Theft Auto, London 1969 and London 1961, set in London, have featured a location outside the United States and used a real-life location.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has included a wide variety of voice actors. The original Grand Theft Auto, its mission packs and its sequel, as well as Grand Theft Auto Advance and Chinatown Wars did not feature any voice credited to specific roles.[56][57] The first game in the series to do so was Grand Theft Auto III which, despite a limited budget and the series' low profile at the time,[58] featured several notable actors from film and television. These included Frank Vincent, Michael Madsen and Kyle MacLachlan, who all had prominent roles. At the time it was rare for a video game to use such high-profile actors, and Grand Theft Auto III is considered a pioneer in doing so.[59]  The next game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, featured more film actors, including Ray Liotta as the player character.  Although the following title, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, also featured many notable film actorssuch as Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Fonda and James Woodsit had been decided that the use of such actors should be reduced, particularly for leading roles. As a result, many of the prominent roles in San Andreas were voiced by lower profile actors or rappers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom Liberty City Stories through to Grand Theft Auto V, the series has continued using lesser known actors to voice main characters, but still uses celebrities and real-life radio personalities to voice the DJs of the many radio stations featured in each game. Some games also feature celebrities portraying themselves, such as Lazlow Jones, Phil Collins,[60] Ricky Gervais[61] and Katt Williams.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Guinness World Records 2008 and 2009 Gamer's Edition, it is the most controversial video game series in history, with over 4,000 articles published about it, which include accusations of glamorising violence, corrupting gamers, and connection to real life crimes.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game was controversial from the very first incarnation of the series.[63] Grand Theft Auto was condemned in Britain, Germany, and France due to its \\"extreme violence\\",[64] and Brazil banned it outright.[64] Publicist Max Clifford planted sensational stories in tabloids in order to help sell the first game.[63][65][66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe controversies flared up again with Grand Theft Auto III, since the 3D graphics made the violence more realistic, and players could pay for the services of prostitutes to restore their health, and if they wished, kill them to get some of their money back.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also criticism from the focus on illegal activities in comparison with traditional \\"heroic\\" roles that other games offer. The main character can commit a wide variety of crimes and violent acts while dealing with only temporary consequences, including the killing of policemen and military personnel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sixth game in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, also came under criticism. One mission in particular, in which the player must instigate a gang war between Haitian and Cuban gangs, has been controversial. Haitian and Cuban anti-defamation groups criticised the game.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean-Robert Lafortune of the Haitian American Grassroots Coalition is quoted as saying that \\"The game shouldn't be designed to destroy human life, it shouldn't be designed to destroy an ethnic group,\\" for this and similar scenarios, including lines in the game's script such as \\"kill the Haitian dickheads\\" said by character \\"Diaz\\" during an altercation between the player and a Haitian gang. After the threat of a lawsuit by the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, Rockstar removed the word \\"Haitians\\" from this phrase in the game's subtitles.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nSan Andreas was criticised initially due to its \\"gangster\\" elements, which include drugs, prostitution, and murder. Later it received additional criticism after the discovery of an interactive sex minigame, nicknamed Hot Coffee; initially cut from the game, it remained in the game code, and was discovered in both the console and Windows versions of the game. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, modders managed to find the unused code in the game and released unofficial patches for the Windows and Xbox (with a modchip) versions as well as a PlayStation 2 version through the use of an Action Replay code enabling the player to engage in these sexual mini-games (dubbed \\"Hot Coffee\\" in reference to a euphemism for sex used in the game). These mini-games were left partially intact in the game's code. This prompted application of an AO (Adults Only) ESRB rating to the version of the game containing the leftover code. Take-Two Interactive was forced to re-release the game in order to restore the M (Mature) rating. A class action lawsuit against Take-Two was also filed as a result of the \\"Hot Coffee\\" code.[68][69]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the controversies involved with this game was Mothers Against Drunk Driving's (MADD) criticism of the ability to drink and drive as a new feature. MADD had even requested ESRB to change the rating of the game from \\"M\\" for ages seventeen and up to \\"AO\\", for adults only, because they felt it was inappropriate for children, even at the age of seventeen, to experience drunk driving in such a manner.[70] In the final game, drunk driving is a playable event, but it is a crime that automatically generates a wanted rating and main playable character Niko Bellic loudly (and drunkenly) proclaims that it is a \\"bad idea\\" and that he \\"should know better\\".[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, it is impossible to drive while drunk in the GTA IV expansions, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. These were released after the criticism. It is, however, possible to drive drunk again in the successor, Grand Theft Auto V.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lost and Damned expansion pack for Grand Theft Auto IV was condemned by US parents group Common Sense Media who issued a public warning against the pack's content due to a full-frontal nudity scene during one of the cutscenes. They claimed the game was \\"more controversial than its predecessors\\" because it featured \\"full frontal male nudity\\".[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Houser, on the making of Chinatown Wars for the Nintendo DS[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has been some controversy over a drug dealing minigame[75] along with comments that some Nintendo games are being aimed at children (despite the fact that the game was rated Mature). The drug dealing mini-game allows players to peddle six types of drugs around the city, but the profit the player makes depends on market conditions, which will be based on the area in which they deal, and the level of regular service this area receives from them.[76][77]\\r\\n\\r\\nA segment in the latest instalment caused controversy for scenes containing player initiated torture. The mission \\"By the Book\\" features graphic depictions of kneecapping, electrocution, dental extraction and waterboarding, and the player is required to perform the acts in order to progress in the game.[78][79][80]\\r\\n\\r\\nUK-based charity Freedom from Torture publicly condemned the use of torture scenes in Grand Theft Auto V. The organisation, who works to rehabilitate survivors of torture, joined other human rights charities who were outraged at a torture scene in the game in which the players have to pull teeth and electrocute an unarmed man in order to extract information. The charity's CEO Keith Best stated: Rockstar North has crossed a line by effectively forcing people to take on the role of a torturer and perform a series of unspeakable acts if they want to achieve success in the game.\\"[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game has also been accused of sexism. The Los Angeles Times considered the game's  satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience.[81] Edge noted that while \\"every female in the game exists solely to be sneered, leered or laughed at\\", it treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence.[82] Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male characters \\"fit with the story we wanted to tell\\".[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral celebrities have sued Rockstar Games and/or Take-Two Interactive for purportedly violating their intellectual property or personality rights, including hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger,[84] Karen Gravano of Mob Wives,[85]  and actress Lindsay Lohan.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer lawyer Jack Thompson has been involved in a number of attempts to get families of murder victims to hold the Grand Theft Auto series accountable for the death of their loved ones. Due to his conduct in this and related cases, Thompson was disbarred in 2008[87] and was fined more than $100,000 by the Florida Bar Association.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 20 October 2003, the families of Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede, two young people shot by teens William and Josh Buckner (who in statements to investigators claimed their actions were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III) filed a US$246 million lawsuit against publishers Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive Software, retailer Walmart, and PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment America.[89][90] Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two, filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in US District Court on 29 October 2003 that the \\"ideas and concepts as well as the 'purported psychological effects' on the Buckners are protected by the First Amendment's free-speech clause\\". The lawyer of the victims, Jack Thompson, denied that, but failed in his attempt to move the lawsuit into a state court and under Tennessee's consumer protection act.[91] Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and the case was closed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2005, a lawsuit was brought upon the makers and distributors of the Grand Theft Auto series claiming the games caused a teenager to shoot and kill three members of the Alabama police force. The shooting took place in June 2003 when Devin Moore, 17 years old at the time, was taken in for questioning by police in Fayette, Alabama regarding a stolen vehicle. Moore then grabbed a pistol from one of the police officers and shot and killed him along with another officer and dispatcher before fleeing in a police car.[92][93] One of Moore's attorneys, Jack Thompson, claimed it was Grand Theft Auto's graphic naturewith his constant playing timethat caused Moore to commit the murders, and Moore's family agrees. Damages were being sought from branches of GameStop and Wal-Mart in Jasper, Alabama, the stores from which Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, respectively, were purchased and also from the games' publisher Take-Two Interactive, and the PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment. On 29 March 2006 the case was dismissed and permission to appeal was denied.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2005, Jack Thompson appeared via satellite on the Glenn Beck program on CNN's Headline News. Thompson mentioned Devin Moore and said regarding Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City \\"There's no doubt in my mind [...] that but for Devin Moore's training on this cop killing simulator, he would not have been able to kill three cops in Fayette, Alabama who are now dead and in the ground. We are suing Take-Two, Sony, Wal-Mart, and GameStop for having trained Devin Moore to kill. He had no history of violence. No criminal record.\\"[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2006, Thompson brought another lawsuit, claiming that Cody Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father Delbert Paul Posey, stepmother Tryone Schmid, and stepsister Marilea Schmid on a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The suit was filed on behalf of the victims' families.[96] The suit alleged that were it not for his obsessive playing of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the murders would not have taken place.[97] Named in the suit were Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony. The suit asked for US$600 million in damages.[98] During the criminal trial, Posey's defence team argued he was abused by his father, and tormented by his stepmother.[99] Posey was also taking Zoloft at the time of the killings.[100] The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2007.[101]\\r\\n\\r\\nEver since the release of Grand Theft Auto III in 2001, the Grand Theft Auto series has been a major success, both critically and financially. It has generated perfect or near perfect reviews and scores on almost all of the games; by September 2013, the series sold over 150 million copies worldwide,[166] and as of August 2015, Grand Theft Auto shipped over 220 million units worldwide.[6] The Times Online reported that Grand Theft Auto IV recorded 609,000 copies in the UK on its first day of release.[167] In its first week, Grand Theft Auto IV sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide and grossed over $500 million.[168]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2006, Grand Theft Auto was voted one of Britain's top 10 designs in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons which included Concorde, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Mini, World Wide Web, Tomb Raider, K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus and the Supermarine Spitfire.[8][169]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series has broken several records, resulting in Guinness World Records awarding the series 10 world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include Most Guest Stars in a Video Game Series, Largest Voice Cast in a Video Game (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), Largest In-Game Soundtrack (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) as well as Most Successful Entertainment Launch of All Time (Grand Theft Auto V). Guinness World Records also ranked Grand Theft Auto in third place on their list of top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[170] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is listed as the most successful game on the PlayStation 2 according to The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III, San Andreas and Vice City currently lie at the 2nd, 5th and 6th highest rated PlayStation 2 games on Metacritic, respectively,[171] while Chinatown Wars is rated the best game on the Nintendo DS[172] and the second best on the PlayStation Portable,[173] and Grand Theft Auto IV is currently rated the second best game ever, with a score of 98, only trailing behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Also, Vice City, Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V lie at 11th, 24th, 27th, 93rd and 2nd best PC games of all time, on Metacritic.[174][175] Along with this, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are currently placed 35th and 59th in the top Xbox 360 games.[176]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe release of Grand Theft Auto III is treated as a major event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier.[188]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring interviews to mark the 10th anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto III, producer of the Street Fighter series, Yoshinori Ono, said \\"It would be no exaggeration to say that Grand Theft Auto III changed the industry, and we can basically separate the time before and after its emergence as distinct eras.\\" In the same article Bethesda studios director, Todd Howard, said \\"The mark of a truly great game is how many people try to recapture or emulate it and fail. There's a long line behind this one.\\"[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting have been called \\"Grand Theft Auto clones\\". Some reviewers even extended this label to the Driver series, even though this series began years before the release of Grand Theft Auto III.[190]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto clones are a type of 3D action-adventure game,[191][192][193][194][195] where players are given the ability to drive any vehicle or fire any weapon as they explore an open world.[196] These games often incorporate violent and criminal themes. Notable games that are comparable to Grand Theft Auto are Saints Row,[197] Scarface: The World Is Yours,[198] True Crime: Streets of LA,[199][200] Watch Dogs,[201] Sleeping Dogs,[202] Just Cause,[203] Mafia[204] and The Godfather.[205]","input":"What's the latest grand theft auto game?"},{"output":"330-1204 AD; 1261-1453 AD","context":"鿼ϫ?? or 鿼ϫ? (in Greek)\\r\\n6?km2 (2.3?sq?mi) enclosed within Constantinian Walls\\r\\nCapital of the Byzantine Empire 330-1204 AD; 1261-1453 AD\\r\\nConstantinople (Greek: 鿼ϫ?? Konstantino~polis or 鿼ϫ? Konstantino~poli; Latin: Constantinopolis; Ottoman Turkish: ?????????, ?os?an?ؐnؐye?) was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine (330ÿ1204 and 1261ÿ1453), and also of the brief Latin (1204ÿ1261), and the later Ottoman (1453ÿ1923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.[5]\\r\\nFrom the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe[6] and it was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and as the guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of Thorns and the True Cross. After the final loss of its provinces in the early 15th century, the Byzantine Empire was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with Morea in Greece, and the city eventually fell to the Ottomans after a month-long siege in 1453.\\r\\nConstantinople was famed for its massive and complex defences. Although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, the defences of Constantinople proved invulnerable for nearly nine hundred years before the city was taken in 1204 by the Crusader armies of the Fourth Crusade, and after it was liberated in 1261 by the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos, a second and final time in 1453 when it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The first wall of the city was erected by Constantine I, and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later, in the 5th century, the Praetorian Prefect Anthemius under the child emperor Theodosius II undertook the construction of the Theodosian Walls, which consisted of a double wall lying about 2?km (1.2 miles) to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front.[7] This formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of Antiquity. The city was built intentionally to rival Rome, and it was claimed that several elevations within its walls matched the 'seven hills' of Rome. Because it was located between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara the land area that needed defensive walls was reduced, and this helped it to present an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, the result of the prosperity that was engendered by its being the gateway between two continents (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Sea).\\r\\nThe city was also famed for its architectural masterpieces, such as the Greek Orthodox cathedral of Hagia Sophia, which served as the seat of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the sacred Imperial Palace where the Emperors lived, the Galata Tower, the Hippodrome, the Golden Gate of the Land Walls, and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares. The University of Constantinople was founded in the fifth century and contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453,[8] including its vast Imperial Library which contained the remnants of the Library of Alexandria and had over 100,000 volumes of ancient texts.[9]\\r\\nConstantinople never truly recovered from the devastation of the Fourth Crusade and the decades of misrule by the Latins. Although the city partially recovered in the early years after the restoration under the Palaiologos dynasty, the advent of the Ottomans and the subsequent loss of the Imperial territories until it became an enclave inside the fledgling Ottoman Empire rendered the city severely depopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks,[10] whereafter it replaced Edirne (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was Lygos,[12] a settlement of likely Thracian origin founded between the 13th and 11th century BC.[13] The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Greek: ?, Byzntion) in around 657 BC,[14] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\\r\\nThe origins of the name of Byzantion, more commonly known by the later Latin Byzantium, are not entirely clear, though some suggest it is of Thraco-Illyrian origin.[15][16] The founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement was named after the leader of the Megarian colonists, Byzas. The later Byzantines of Constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named in honour of two men, Byzas and Antes, though this was more likely just a play on the word Byzantion.[17]\\r\\nThe city was briefly renamed Augusta Antonina in the early 3rd century by the Emperor Septimius Severus (193ÿ211), having razed the city to the ground in 196 AD for supporting a rival contender in the civil war and rebuilt, in honour of his son Antoninus, the later Emperor Caracalla.[18][19] The name appears to have been quickly forgotten and abandoned, and the city reverted to Byzantium/Byzantion after either the assassination of Caracalla in 217 or, at the latest, the fall of the Severan dynasty in 235.\\r\\nByzantium took on the name of Konstantinoupolis (\\"city of Constantine\\", Constantinople) after its re-foundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to Byzantium in 330 AD and designated his new capital officially as Nova Roma (?ϫ ??׻) 'New Rome'. During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and Roma Constantinopolitana.[20] As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.\\r\\nAs the largest and wealthiest city in Europe during the 4thÿ13th centuries and a centre of culture and education of the Mediterranean basin, Constantinople came to be known by prestigious titles such as Basileuousa (Queen of Cities) and Megalopolis (the Great City) and was, in colloquial speech, commonly referred to as just Polis ( ?) 'the City' by Constantinopolitans and provincial Byzantines alike.[21]\\r\\nIn the language of other peoples, Constantinople was referred to just as reverently. The medieval Vikings, who had contacts with the empire through their expansion in eastern Europe (Varangians) used the Old Norse name Miklagarer (from mikill 'big' and garer 'city'), and later Miklagard and Miklagarth. In Arabic, the city was sometimes called Rmiyyat al-kubra (Great City of the Romans) and in Persian as Takht-e Rum (Throne of the Romans).\\r\\nIn East and South Slavic languages, including in medieval Russia, Constantinople was referred to as Tsargrad (ђ^̰) or Carigrad, 'City of the Caesar (Emperor)', from the Slavonic words tsar ('Caesar' or 'King') and grad ('city'). This was presumably a calque on a Greek phrase such as ϫ?? ?? (Vasileos Polis), 'the city of the emperor [king]'.\\r\\nThe modern Turkish name for the city, ?stanbul, derives from the Greek phrase eis tin polin (?? ? ?), meaning \\"into the city\\" or \\"to the city\\".[22] This name was used in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. In 1928, the Turkish alphabet was changed from Arabic script to Latin script. After that, as part of the 1920s Turkification movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use Turkish names for Turkish cities, instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in the Ottoman times.[23][24][25][26] In time the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.\\r\\nThe name \\"Constantinople\\" is still used by members of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox patriarch based in the city, referred to as \\"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.\\" In Greece today, the city is still called Konstantino~polis/Konstantino~poli (鿼ϫ?/鿼ϫ??) or simply just \\"the City\\" ( ? /  ??).\\r\\nConstantinople was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I (272ÿ337 AD) in 324[5] on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of Megara. This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of Lygos, referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories,[27] Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement, except that it was abandoned by the time the Megarian colonists settled the site anew. The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of Megara founded Byzantium (Greek: ?, Byzntion) in around 657 BC,[14] across from the town of Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.\\r\\nThe city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by Darius I in 512 BC into the Persian Empire, who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a pontoon bridge crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478 BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the Second Persian Invasion of Greece, a Greek army led by the Spartan general Pausanias captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411 BC.[28] A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in c.150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.[29] This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the Pax Romana, for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.[30]\\r\\nByzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of Athens, Corinth, and Sparta, but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position. The site lay astride the land route from Europe to Asia and the seaway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and had in the Golden Horn an excellent and spacious harbour. Already then, in Greek and early Roman times, Byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture, and its position at the crossroads of the Asiatic-European trade route over land and as the gateway between the Mediterranean and Black Seas made it too valuable a settlement to abandon, as Emperor Septimius Severus later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting Pescennius Niger's claimancy.[31] It was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian Cassius Dio who said that Severus had destroyed \\"a strong Roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from Pontus and Asia\\".[32] He would later rebuild Byzantium towards the end of his reign, in which it would be briefly renamed Augusta Antonina, fortifying it with a new city wall in his name, the Severan Wall.\\r\\nConstantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in the course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.\\r\\nConstantinople was built over 6 years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.[5][33] Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.[34] Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a proconsul, rather than an urban prefect. It had no praetors, tribunes, or quaestors. Although it did have senators, they held the title clarus, not clarissimus, like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in Asiana and Pontica and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.[35]\\r\\nConstantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the Augustaeum. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the Great Palace of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the Chalke, and its ceremonial suite known as the Palace of Daphne. Nearby was the vast Hippodrome for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed Baths of Zeuxippus. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the Milion, a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.\\r\\nFrom the Augustaeum led a great street, the Mese (Greek: ? [ѮѴ??] lit. \\"Middle [Street]\\"), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the Praetorium or law-court. Then it passed through the oval Forum of Constantine where there was a second Senate-house and a high column with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of Helios, crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there, the Mese passed on and through the Forum Tauri and then the Forum Bovis, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the Constantinian Wall. After the construction of the Theodosian Walls in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new Golden Gate, reaching a total length of seven Roman miles.[36]\\r\\nThe importance of Constantinople increased, but it was gradual. From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I, emperors had been resident only in the years 337-8, 347ÿ51, 358ÿ61, 368ÿ69. Its status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who held office from 11 December 359 until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100-mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor Valens, who hated the city and spent only one year there, nevertheless built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkap? Palace), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.\\r\\nAfter the shock of the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the emperor Valens with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the Visigoths within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413ÿ414 Theodosius II built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall triple-wall fortifications, which were not to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a University near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.\\r\\nUldin, a prince of the Huns, appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city and the fleet on the Danube improved.\\r\\nAfter the barbarians overran the Western Roman Empire, Constantinople became the indisputable capital city of the Roman Empire. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.\\r\\nThe emperor Justinian I (527ÿ565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in 70 AD and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St. Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church.[38]\\r\\nChariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.\\r\\nThroughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said[39] to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the \\"Nika\\" riots (from the battle-cry of \\"Victory!\\" of those involved).\\r\\nFires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable Hagia Sophia. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.[40] The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \\"O Solomon, I have outdone thee!\\"[41] Hagia Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.[42]\\r\\nJustinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a new church under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of Mehmet II the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within 100 feet (30?m) of the sea front, in order to protect the view.[43]\\r\\nDuring Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000 people.[44] However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the Plague of Justinian between 541ÿ542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants.[45]\\r\\nIn the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople with attack from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son of the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city could no longer be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population fell substantially as a result.[46]\\r\\nWhile the city withstood a siege by the Sassanids and Avars in 626, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628, when the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, further sieges followed the Arab conquests, first from 674 to 678 and then in 717 to 718. The Theodosian Walls kept the city impregnable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as Greek Fire allowed the Byzantine navy to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, the second ruler of Bulgaria, Khan Tervel, rendered decisive help. He was called Saviour of Europe.[47]\\r\\nIn the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire.[48]\\r\\nTheodora, widow of the Emperor Theophilus (died 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son Michael III, who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the monastery of Gastria, but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867.[49]\\r\\nIn 860, an attack was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at Kiev by Askold and Dir, two Varangian chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban Prince's Islands. Oryphas, the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens.[50]\\r\\nIn 980, the emperor Basil II received an unusual gift from Prince Vladimir of Kiev: 6,000 Varangian warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the Varangian Guard. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the Thracesian theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.[51] However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.[52] Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by Anglo-Saxons who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new Norman kings of England.[53]\\r\\nThe Book of the Eparch, which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.[54]\\r\\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.[55]\\r\\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.[56] Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \\"fruit store and aviary\\".[57] Following the death of her son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.\\r\\nThe iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress Theodora, who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the Western and the Eastern Churches.\\r\\nIn the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.\\r\\nUnder the Comnenian dynasty (1081ÿ1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery. In 1090ÿ91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.[58] In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account.[59] John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds.[60]\\r\\nWith the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I Komnenos's reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000ÿ80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.[61] In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews.[62] In 1182, all Latin (Western European) inhabitants of Constantinople were massacred.[63]\\r\\nIn artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the mosaic art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization):\\r\\nOn 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kap?s?) on the Golden Horn.[64][65] Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders. In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the defensive chain protecting the Golden Horn and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new Alexius IV found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.\\r\\nIn February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.\\r\\nSir Steven Runciman, historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is unparalleled in history.\\r\\nFor nine centuries, he goes on, the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians ... seized treasures and carried them off to adorn ... their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars ... . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver iconostasis to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarchs throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes ... continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. ... When ... order was restored, ... citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.[66]\\r\\nFor the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the Latin Empire. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. \\"As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,\\" Talbot concludes.[67]\\r\\nThe Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.[68] However, this act of maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno John Geanokoplos writes that \\"it may well be that a division is suggested here: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the churches.\\"[69] Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to raise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which adorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for coinage. \\"Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, \\"were a Herakles attributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor Lysippos, and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.\\"[70]\\r\\nThe Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their valuable building materials; by sending money to the Latins \\"to buy them off\\" (exonesamenos), he prevented the destruction of several churches.[71] According to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, Rouphinianai, and St. Michael at Anaplous. He also granted funds for the restoration of the Church of the Holy Apostles, which had been seriously damaged in an earthquake.[70]\\r\\nThe Byzantine nobility scattered, many going to Nicaea, where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to Epirus, where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to Trebizond, where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.[72] Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was captured from its last Latin ruler, Baldwin II, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos.\\r\\nAlthough Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people.[73] The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents who had fled the city when the crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital.[74] In 1347, the Black Death spread to Constantinople.[75] In 1453, when the Ottoman Turks captured the city, it contained approximately 50,000 people.[76]\\r\\nConstantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by 22-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The conquest of Constantinople followed a seven-week siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.\\r\\nThe Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople was now under Ottoman control. When Mehmed II finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the Topkapi Gate, he immediately rode his horse to the Hagia Sophia, where he ordered his soldiers to stop hacking at the marbles and 'be satisfied with the booty and captives; as for all the buildings, they belonged to him'.[77] He ordered that an imam meet him there in order to chant the adhan thus transforming the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque,[77][78] solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.\\r\\nMehmeds main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the citys defenses and population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.[79] Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.[79] From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called \\"Srgn\\" in Turkish (Greek: ?Ѵ?).[10] Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler Evliya ?elebi gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray, ?ar?amba, bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.[10] However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.[10]\\r\\nConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular, Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, \\"As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\\"\\r\\nIt was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.\\r\\nArmenians, Syrians, Slavs and Georgians were part of the Byzantine social hierarchy.[80]\\r\\nThe city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula. Many scholars[who?] argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed.\\r\\nConstantinople's fame was such that it was described even in contemporary Chinese histories, the Old and New Book of Tang, which mentioned its massive walls and gates as well as a purported clepsydra mounted with a golden statue of a man.[81][82][83] The Chinese histories even related how the city had been besieged in the 7th century by Muawiyah I and how he exacted tribute in a peace settlement.[82][84]\\r\\nThe Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark's Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.\\r\\nConstantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam.","input":"How long was constantinople the capital of the byzantine empire?"},{"output":"Round Rock","context":"Coordinates: 303936.8N 982613.7W? / ?30.660222N 98.437139W? / 30.660222; -98.437139\\r\\nThe Texas Chainsaw House is located in Kingsland, Texas, on the grounds of The Antlers Hotel.

The house originally set across the street from the Chainsaw house, on Quick Hill Road. But it was later moved to another location within La Frontera and was not originally recognized as a twin because of the dilapidated condition of the house and it being completely overgrown with plants and trees.[4] It was moved in 2006 and restored by the developers of La Frontera, Don Martin and Bill Smalling (1953ÿ2008).

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West and East Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.[1][2]\\r\\nFitzgeraldinspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island's north shorebegan planning the novel in 1923, desiring to produce, in his words, \\"something newsomething extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\\"[3] Progress was slow, with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924. His editor, Maxwell Perkins, felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter. Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book's title and he considered a variety of alternatives, including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue.\\r\\nFirst published by Scribner's in April 1925, The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly; in its first year, the book sold only 20,000 copies. Fitzgerald died in 1940, believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten. However, the novel experienced a revival during World War II, and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades. Today, The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title \\"Great American Novel.\\" In 1998, the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century's best American novel and second best English-language novel of the same time period.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSet on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for profound economic prosperity, the development of jazz music flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby's fortune.[5] Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book's plotline within the historical context of the era.[6]\\r\\nFitzgerald's visits to Long Island's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby's setting. Today, there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book. One possibility is Land's End, a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party.[7] Many of the events in Fitzgerald's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota, and like Nick, he was educated at an Ivy League school, Princeton (in Nick's case, Yale). Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby, in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved. Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant and was stationed at Camp Sheridan, in Montgomery, Alabama. There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen-year-old beauty named Zelda Sayre. Zelda finally agreed to marry him, but her preference for wealth, fun, and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success.[8] Like Nick in The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting, and, like Gatsby, he had always idolized the very rich.[8] In many ways, The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age. Like Gatsby, Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted, even as she led him toward everything he despised.[8]\\r\\nIn her book Careless People: Murder, Mayhem and the Invention of 'The Great Gatsby (2013), Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall-Mills Case.[9] Based on her forensic search for clues, she asserts that the two victims in the Hall-Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby.[10]\\r\\nIn the summer of 1922, Nick Carraway, a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwestwho serves as the novel's narratortakes a job in New York as a bond salesman. He rents a small house on Long Island, in the fictional village of West Egg, next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them. Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin, Daisy Fay Buchanan, and her husband, Tom, a college acquaintance of Nick's. They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker, an attractive, cynical young golfer. She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives in the \\"valley of ashes\\",[11] an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City. Not long after this revelation, Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment where Tom keeps his affairs with Myrtle and others. At Tom's New York apartment, a vulgar and bizarre party takes place. It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy's name several times.\\r\\nNick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party and they meet Gatsby himself, an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War. Through Jordan, Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917 when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services' work with young officers headed to Europe. From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time, Gatsby became (and still is) deeply in love with Daisy. Gatsby had hoped that his wild parties would attract an unsuspecting Daisy, who lived across the bay, to appear at his doorstep and allow him to present himself as a man of wealth and position.\\r\\nHaving developed a budding friendship with Nick, Gatsby uses him to arrange a reunion between himself and Daisy. Nick invites Daisy to have tea at his house without telling her that Gatsby will also be there. After an initially awkward reunion, Gatsby and Daisy begin an affair over the summer. At a luncheon at the Buchanans' house, Daisy speaks to Gatsby with such undisguised intimacy that Tom realizes she is in love with Gatsby. Though Tom is himself involved in an extramarital affair, he is outraged by his wife's infidelity. He forces the group to drive into New York City and confronts Gatsby in a suite at the Plaza Hotel, asserting that he and Daisy have a history that Gatsby could never understand. In addition to that, he announces to his wife that Gatsby is a criminal whose fortune comes from bootlegging alcohol and other illegal activities. Daisy realizes that her allegiance is to Tom, and Tom contemptuously sends her back to East Egg with Gatsby, attempting to prove that Gatsby cannot hurt her.\\r\\nOn the way back, Gatsby's car strikes and kills Tom's mistress, Myrtle. Nick later learns from Gatsby that Daisy, not Gatsby himself, was driving the car at the time of the accident. Myrtle's husband, George Wilson, falsely concludes that the driver of the yellow car is the secret lover he suspects she has. He learns that the yellow car is Gatsby's, fatally shoots him and then turns the gun on himself. Nick stages an unsettlingly small funeral for Gatsby which none of Gatsby's associates or partygoers attend. Later, Nick runs into Tom in New York and finds out that Tom had told George that the yellow car was Gatsby's and gave him Gatsby's address. Disillusioned with the East, Nick moves back to the Midwest.\\r\\nFitzgerald began planning his third novel in June 1922,[5] but it was interrupted by production of his play, The Vegetable, in the summer and fall.[20] The play failed miserably, and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production.[21][22] The stories were, in his words, \\"all trash and it nearly broke my heart,\\"[22] although included among those stories was \\"Winter Dreams\\", which Fitzgerald later described as \\"a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea\\".[23]\\r\\nAfter the birth of their child, the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck, New York, on Long Island, in October 1922. The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby.[24] Fitzgerald's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner, actor Lew Fields, and comedian Ed Wynn.[5] These figures were all considered to be \\"new money\\", unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula, places which were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families, and which sat across the bay from Great Neck. This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for \\"West Egg\\" and \\"East Egg\\". In this novel, Great Neck (King's Point) became the \\"new money\\" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) the old-money East Egg.[25] Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's home, such as Oheka Castle[26] and Beacon Towers, since demolished.[27]\\r\\nBy mid-1923, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel[28] but discarded most of his new story as a false start, some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story \\"Absolution\\".[5][29]\\r\\nWork on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924. Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger, \\"Out of woods at last and starting novel.\\"[22] He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a \\"consciously artistic achievement\\"[30] and a \\"purely creative worknot trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world.\\"[31] He added later, during editing, that he felt \\"an enormous power in me now, more than I've ever had.\\"[32] Soon after this burst of inspiration, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera, where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed.[22] By August, however, Fitzgerald was hard at work and completed what he believed to be his final manuscript in October, sending the book to his editor, Maxwell Perkins, and agent, Harold Ober, on October 30.[22] The Fitzgeralds then moved to Rome for the winter.[33] Fitzgerald made revisions through the winter after Perkins informed him in a November letter that the character of Gatsby was \\"somewhat vague\\" and Gatsby's wealth and business, respectively, needed \\"the suggestion of an explanation\\" and should be \\"adumbrated\\".[34]\\r\\nContent after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald returned the final batch of revised galleys in the middle of February 1925.[35] Fitzgerald's revisions included an extensive rewriting of Chapter VI and VIII.[22] Despite this, he refused an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights in order not to delay the book's publication.[22] He had received a $3,939 advance in 1923[36] and $1,981.25 upon publication.[37]\\r\\nThe cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature.[38] It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it.[38] The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had \\"written it into\\" the novel.[38] Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg[39] (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as \\"blue and gigantic?ÿ their retinas[note 2] are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose.\\" Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the \\"girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs.\\"[38] Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but \\"Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it.\\"[40]\\r\\nFitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly choosing The Great Gatsby,[41] a title inspired by Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes.[42] Prior, Fitzgerald shifted between Gatsby; Among Ash-Heaps and Millionaires; Trimalchio;[41] Trimalchio in West Egg;[43] On the Road to West Egg;[43] Under the Red, White, and Blue;[41] The Gold-Hatted Gatsby;[41][43] and The High-Bouncing Lover.[41][43] The titles The Gold-Hatted Gatsby and The High-Bouncing Lover came from Fitzgerald's epigraph for the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name of Thomas Parke D'Invilliers.[44] He initially preferred titles referencing Trimalchio, the crude parvenu in Petronius' Satyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel: \\"It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday nightand, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Trimalchio was over.\\"[45] Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the audacious and libidinous orgies he hosted but, according to Tony Tanner's introduction to the Penguin edition, there are subtle similarities between the two.[46]\\r\\nIn November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that \\"I have now decided to stick to the title I put on the book?... Trimalchio in West Egg\\"[47] but was eventually persuaded that the reference was too obscure and that people would not be able to pronounce it.[48] His wife, Zelda, and Perkins both expressed their preference for The Great Gatsby and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.[49] A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title it Trimalchio or Gold-Hatted Gatsby but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925,[50] Fitzgerald expressed intense enthusiasm for the title Under the Red, White and Blue, but it was at that stage too late to change.[51][52] The Great Gatsby was published on April 10, 1925.[53] Fitzgerald remarked that \\"the title is only fair, rather bad than good.\\"[54]\\r\\nEarly drafts of the novel entitled Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published.[55][56] A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio. Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Jay Gatsby is more even,[57] although Daisy still returns to Tom.\\r\\nSarah Churchwell sees The Great Gatsby as a \\"cautionary tale of the decadent downside of the American dream.\\" The story deals with the limits and realities of America's ideals of social and class mobility; and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations to rise above the station(s) of their birth. The book in stark relief through the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes that: \\"...a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth.\\" [58] Using elements of irony and tragic ending, it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich, and recklessness of youth.[59][60] Others, like journalist Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby as a story \\"underlying permanence of class differences; even in the face of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs.\\"[61] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because it is a story about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to the 21st century have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, \\"While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsby's basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society.\\"[61] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).[61]\\r\\nLater critical writings on The Great Gatsby, following the novel's revival, focus in particular on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream? life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?ÿ in the context of the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, Roger Pearson published the article Gatsby: False prophet of the American Dream, in which he states that Fitzgerald \\"has come to be associated with this concept of the AMERICAN Dream more than any other writer of the twentieth century\\".[62] Pearson goes on to suggest that Gatsby's failure to realize the American dream demonstrates that it no longer exists except in the minds of those as materialistic as Gatsby. He concludes that the American dream pursued by Gatsby \\"is, in reality, a nightmare\\", bringing nothing but discontent and disillusionment to those who chase it as they realize its unsustainability and ultimately its unattainability.\\r\\nIn addition to exploring the trials and tribulations of achieving the great American dream during the Jazz Age, The Great Gatsby explores societal gender expectations as a theme, exemplifying in Daisy Buchanan's character the marginalization of women in the East Egg social class that Fitzgerald depicts. As an upper-class, white woman living in East Egg during this time period in America, Daisy must adhere to certain societal expectations, including but certainly not limited to actively filling the role of dutiful wife, mother, keeper of the house, and charming socialite. As the reader finds in the novel, many of Daisy's choices, ultimately culminating in the tragedy of the plot and misery for all those involved, can be at least partly attributed to her prescribed role as a \\"beautiful little fool\\" who is completely reliant on her husband for financial and societal security. For instance, one could argue that Daisy's ultimate decision to remain with her husband despite her feelings for Gatsby can be attributed to the status, security, and comfort that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides. Additionally, the theme of the female familial role within The Great Gatsby goes hand in hand with that of the ideal family unit associated with the great American dream- a dream that goes unrealized for Gatsby and Daisy in Fitzgerald's prose.[63]\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby was published by Charles Scribner's Sons on April 10, 1925. Fitzgerald called Perkins on the day of publication to monitor reviews: \\"Any news?\\"[22] \\"Sales situation doubtful,\\" read a wire from Perkins on April 20, \\"[but] excellent reviews.\\" Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable \\"depressed\\" him, closing the letter with \\"Yours in great depression.\\"[64] Fitzgerald had hoped the novel would be a great commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.[64] By October, when the original sale had run its course, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.[22][60][64] Despite this, Scribner's continually kept the book in print; they carried the original edition on their trade list until 1946, by which time Gatsby was in print in three other forms and the original edition was no longer needed.[22] Fitzgerald received letters of praise from contemporaries T. S. Eliot, Edith Wharton, and Willa Cather regarding the novel; however, this was private opinion, and Fitzgerald feverishly demanded the public recognition of reviewers and readers.[22]\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby received mixed reviews from literary critics of the day. Generally the most effusive of the positive reviews was Edwin Clark of The New York Times, who felt the novel was \\"A curious book, a mystical, glamourous [sic] story of today.\\"[65] Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"[the novel] leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder,\\" calling the book \\"a revelation of life\\" and \\"a work of art.\\"[66] The New York Post called the book \\"fascinating?... His style fairly scintillates, and with a genuine brilliance; he writes surely and soundly.\\"[67] The New York Herald Tribune was unimpressed, but referred to The Great Gatsby as \\"purely ephemeral phenomenon, but it contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine-so light, so delicate, so sharp?.... a literary lemon meringue.\\"[68] In The Chicago Daily Tribune, H.L. Mencken called the book \\"in form no more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable at that,\\" while praising the book's \\"careful and brilliant finish.\\"[69]\\r\\nSeveral writers felt that the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him. Harvey Eagleton of The Dallas Morning News believed the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's success: \\"One finishes Great Gatsby with a feeling of regret, not for the fate of the people in the book, but for Mr. Fitzgerald.\\"[70] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, \\"Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw.\\"[71] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book \\"a minor performance?... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical.\\"[72] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style \\"painfully forced\\", noting that the editors of the paper were \\"quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day.\\"[73] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: \\"All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about.\\"[22]\\r\\nFitzgerald's goal was to produce a literary work which would truly prove himself as a writer,[74] and Gatsby did not have the commercial success of his two previous novels, This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned. Although the novel went through two initial printings, some of these copies remained unsold years later.[75] Fitzgerald himself blamed poor sales on the fact that women tended to be the main audience for novels during this time, and Gatsby did not contain an admirable female character.[75] According to his own ledger, now made available online by University of South Carolina's Thomas Cooper library, he earned only $2,000 from the book.[76] Although 1926 brought Owen Davis' stage adaption and the Paramount-issued silent film version, both of which brought in money for the author, Fitzgerald still felt the novel fell short of the recognition he hoped for and, most importantly, would not propel him to becoming a serious novelist in the public eye.[22] For several years afterward, the general public believed The Great Gatsby to be nothing more than a nostalgic period piece.[22]\\r\\nIn 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten.[77] His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as Fitzgerald \\"at his best\\".[78] A strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence.[79] The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing the sentiment that the book was an enduring work of fiction.[22]\\r\\nIn 1942, a group of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime. The Council's purpose was to distribute paperback books to soldiers fighting in the Second World War. The Great Gatsby was one of these books. The books proved to be \\"as popular as pin-up girls\\" among the soldiers, according to the Saturday Evening Post's contemporary report.[80] 155,000 copies of Gatsby were distributed to soldiers overseas.[81].\\r\\nBy 1944, full-length articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published, and the following year, \\"the opinion that Gatsby was merely a period piece had almost entirely disappeared.\\"[22] This revival was paved by interest shown by literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's friend.[82] In 1951, Arthur Mizener published The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of Fitzgerald.[83] He emphasized The Great Gatsby's positive reception by literary critics, which may have influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.[84]\\r\\nBy 1960, the book was steadily selling 50,000 copies per year, and renewed interest led The New York Times editorialist Arthur Mizener to proclaim the novel \\"a classic of twentieth-century American fiction\\".[22] The Great Gatsby has sold over 25 million copies worldwide as of 2013, annually sells an additional 500,000 copies, and is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, the e-book alone sold 185,000 copies.[77]\\r\\nScribner's copyright is scheduled to expire in 2020, according to Maureen Corrigan's book about the making of The Great Gatsby, So We Read On.[85]\\r\\nThe Great Gatsby has resulted in a number of film and television adaptations:\\r\\nThe New York Metropolitan Opera commissioned John Harbison to compose an operatic treatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary of James Levine's debut. The work, called The Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[99]","input":"What kind of story is the great gatsby?"},{"output":"Unilever","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBen & Jerry's Homemade Holdings Inc, trading and commonly known as Ben & Jerry's, is an American company that  manufactures ice cream, frozen yogurt, and sorbet. It was founded in 1978 in Burlington, Vermont, and sold in 2000 to Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever. Today it operates globally as a fully owned subsidiary of Unilever.  Its present-day headquarters is in South Burlington, Vermont, with its main factory in Waterbury, Vermont.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were childhood friends from Merrick, New York.[2] Although Greenfield finished college, he found himself unable to make his way into medical school. Cohen dropped out of school.[3] In 1977, Cohen and Greenfield completed a correspondence course on ice cream making from Pennsylvania State University's creamery. Cohen has severe anosmia, a lack of a sense of smell or taste, and so relied on \\"mouth feel\\" and texture to provide variety in his diet. This led to the company's trademark chunks being mixed in with their ice cream.[4] On May 5, 1978, with a $12,000[5] investment, the two business partners opened an ice cream parlor in a renovated gas station in downtown Burlington, Vermont.  In 1979, they marked their anniversary by holding the first-ever free cone day, now an international annual celebration at every Ben & Jerry's store.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, they rented space in an old spool and bobbin mill on South Champlain Street in Burlington and started packing their ice cream in pints. In 1981, the first Ben & Jerry's franchise opened on Route 7 in Shelburne, Vermont. In 1983, Ben & Jerrys ice cream was used to build the worlds largest ice cream sundae in St. Albans, Vermont; the sundae weighed 27,102 pounds (12,293?kg). That same year, the cows on their cartons were redesigned by local artist Woody Jackson.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1984, H?agen-Dazs wanted to limit distribution of Ben & Jerrys in Boston, prompting Ben & Jerrys to file suit against the parent company, Pillsbury, in its now famous Whats the Doughboy Afraid Of? campaign.[7] In 1987, H?agen-Dazs again tried to enforce exclusive distribution, and Ben & Jerrys filed its second lawsuit against the Pillsbury Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1985, the Ben & Jerrys Foundation was established at the end of the year with a gift from Ben & Jerry's to fund community-oriented projects; it was then provided with 7.5% of the companys annual pre-tax profits. In 1986, Ben & Jerrys launched its Cowmobile, a modified mobile home used to distribute free scoops of Ben & Jerrys ice cream in a unique, cross-country marketing drive쨕driven and served by Ben and Jerry themselves. The Cowmobile burned to the ground outside of Cleveland four months later, but there were no injuries. Ben said it looked like the worlds largest baked Alaska.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988, the two men won the title of U.S. Small Business Persons Of The Year, awarded by U.S. President Ronald Reagan.[9] Also that year, the first brownies were ordered from Greyston Bakery, which led to the development of the popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor.[10] In 1992, Ben & Jerrys joined in a co-operative campaign with the national non-profit Children's Defense Fund; the campaign goal was to bring childrens basic needs to the top of the national agenda. Over 70,000 postcards were sent to Congress concerning kids and other national issues. In 1995, they hired Robert Holland, Jr. as CEO after holding a \\"Yo! I'm your C.E.O.\\" essay contest as part of the search.[11] Holland left after 20 months following philosophical differences and was replaced by Perry Odak in 1997.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1989, Ben & Jerrys revealed their opposition of the use of rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) in all their products. This genetically engineered hormone is sometimes given to cows in order to boost milk production, but Ben & Jerrys does not support this practice and is in favor of utilizing less chemically intensive ingredients for the safety of consumers and the environment.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1994, Ben & Jerry's: The Inside Scoop, written by Fred \\"Chico\\" Lager, former CEO of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, was published. The book tracks the history of how Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream got started. The book focuses on \\"How Two Real Guys Built a Business with a Social Conscience and a Sense of Humor.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2000, Ben & Jerry's sold the company to Anglo-Dutch multinational food giant Unilever.[15] Unilever said it hopes to carry on the tradition of engaging \\"in these critical, global economic and social missions\\". Although the founders' names are still attached to the product, they do not hold any board or management position and are not involved in day-to-day management of the company.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Ben & Jerry's U.S. completed the transition to \\"Eco-Pint\\" packaging, which packaged all pint flavors in environmentally friendly unbleached paperboard Eco-Pint containers, a decision it later reversed. The use of brown-kraft unbleached paperboard had been a critical first step toward a totally biodegradable pint made without added chlorine. Due to what they described as increasing supply, quality, and cost challenges, Ben & Jerry's discontinued their use of the Eco-Pint in 2006, transitioning to a pint container made out of a bleached paperboard that it said was more readily available.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Earth Day in 2005, when a vote in the U.S. Senate proposed the opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, Ben & Jerry's launched a protest by creating the largest ever Baked Alaska, which weighed 900 pounds (410?kg), and placed it in front of the U.S. Capitol Building.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2009, \\"CyClone Dairy\\"[20] launched an advertising campaign and a website to promote its milk products, which purportedly came exclusively from cloned cows.[21] On April 1, 2009 (April Fool's Day), Ben & Jerry's announced that it was behind this fake company. Ben & Jerry's had created the tongue-in-cheek hoax to raise awareness of the increasing presence of products from cloned animals within American food[22][23] and to campaign for a tracking system of cloned-animal products.[24] The hoax was revealed on April Fool's Day with the message: \\"We believe you should have the right to choose which foods you eat ÿ and not to eat cloned foods if you dont want to. And that's why Ben & Jerrys believes we need a national clone tracking system, so people and companies can know where their food is coming from.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, Jostein Solheim, a Unilever executive from Norway, became the new CEO of the company and had this to say about the transition: \\"My mantra that I've repeated a hundred times since starting at Ben & Jerry's is: Change is a wonderful thing,'\\" he said. \\"The world needs dramatic change to address the social and environmental challenges we are facing. Values led businesses can play a critical role in driving that positive change. We need to lead by example, and prove to the world that this is the best way to run a business. Historically, this company has been and must continue to be a pioneer to continually challenge how business can be a force for good and address inequities inherent in global business.\\"[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 24, 2012, Ben & Jerry's released a new Greek Frozen Yogurt line, which came in several flavors: \\"Strawberry Shortcake\\", \\"Blueberry Vanilla Graham\\", \\"Raspberry Fudge Chunk\\", \\"Banana Peanut Butter\\",[27] and \\"Vanilla\\" (scoop shop exclusive):[28] On April 12, 2013, \\"Pineapple Passionfruit\\", \\"Vanilla Honey Caramel\\", and \\"Liz Lemon\\" were added to the Greek Yogurt line.[29] The Liz Lemon flavor was inspired by a character of the same name created by actress Tina Fey as the main character on the NBC television sitcom 30 Rock.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, Ben & Jerrys committed to making their products GMO-free in support of mandatory GMO labeling legislation.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Vermonster\\" is a large ice cream sundae served in a \\"Vermonster Bucket\\" in Ben & Jerry's \\"scoop shops.\\"  Its ingredients are 20 scoops of ice cream, 4 bananas, 4 ladles of hot fudge, 3 chocolate chip cookies, 1 chocolate fudge brownie, 10 scoops of walnuts, 2 scoops each of any 4 toppings, and whipped cream. It contains 14,000 calories (kcal), and 500 grams (17.64?oz) of fat. Since 2009, the Vermonster Challenge is an annual charity event held by Ben & Jerry's in which teams of four compete to finish a Vermonster and win free ice cream for a year.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Chubby Hubby\\" consists of vanilla malt ice cream swirled with fudge and peanut butter, and containing pretzel nuggets covered in fudge and filled with peanut butter. During the month of September 2009, Ben and Jerry's, in partnership with Freedom to Marry, renamed \\"Chubby Hubby\\" to \\"Hubby Hubby,\\" in celebration of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the company's home state of Vermont. The carton featured the image of two men getting married beneath a rainbow.[33][34][35]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 13, 2012, Ben & Jerrys announced it would be changing the name of one of its ice cream flavours in the UK in support of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. \\"Oh! My! Apple Pie!\\" would become \\"Apple-y Ever After\\" and tubs would feature a gay couple atop a wedding cake decorated with rainbows.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\\" was temporarily renamed \\"I Dough, I Dough\\" in the United States during the summer of 2015. This was in celebration of United States Supreme Court's ruling in support of same-sex marriage. The proceeds from sales were to go to the Human Rights Campaign (a nonprofit advocacy group for LGBT rights).[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Cohen and Jerry Greenfield appeared on The Colbert Report on March 5, 2007, to promote their new ice cream flavor, \\"Stephen Colbert's AmeriCone Dream\\", and Cohen's progressive advocacy group TrueMajority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company renamed a flavour, \\"Yes Pecan!\\", in reference to Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They decided in January 2009 to donate all proceeds made on the sale of that flavor to the Common Cause Education Fund.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 2, 2011, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavour of ice cream, \\"Late Night Snack\\", whose carton features a picture of Jimmy Fallon on it.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 17, 2015, Cohen and Greenfield appeared on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon and unveiled their new flavor of ice cream, \\"The Tonight Dough\\", with all of its proceeds going to the SeriousFun Children's Network that supports camps for children with major illnesses.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Charoset flavoured ice cream became widely available in time for the Passover holiday.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2015, the company confirmed that it was working on vegan options, after hearing consumers' feedback, led by a petition and FARM organization.[47]\\r\\nIn early February 2016, the company announced a new all-vegan line with four flavors. Two of these are versions of existing flavors - \\"Chunky Monkey\\" and \\"Chocolate Fudge Brownie\\" - and two are all-new vegan-only flavors: \\"Coffee Caramel Fudge\\" and \\"Peanut Butter & Cookies\\".[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2017, three new non-dairy flavors were added: Caramel Almond Brittle, Cherry Garcia, and Coconut Seven Layer Bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2018, the company added two new non-dairy flavors to its growing line of vegan options. Peanut Butter Half Baked features chocolate and peanut butter with fudge brownies and pieces of peanut butter cookie dough, while Cinnamon Buns is made with cinnamon-spiced ice cream and features cinnamon bun dough and a cinnamon streusel swirl.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nFree Cone Day is an annual event held between late March and early May, in which Ben & Jerry's scoop shops give out free ice cream cups and cones. Free Cone Day was first held on Saturday, May 5, 1979, by Ben and Jerry as a customer and staff appreciation event for the first anniversary of their store's opening.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver one million free cones are given away each year, prompting the company's ad slogan \\"Be One In A Million.\\" Charitable organizations are often present at the stores each year and enjoy a significant amount of fundraising success. Often, local celebrities show up at various stores, promoting the day and the charities there.[50] Sometimes the event is scheduled to coincide with Earth Day and sometimes volunteers are on hand with clipboards and voter registration forms to help those who would like to register to vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer-advocacy group, urged Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling their ice cream as \\"all natural,\\" due to the company's use of corn syrup, alkalised cocoa, and other chemically modified ingredients.[51] In September 2010, the company agreed to stop labeling their ice cream and frozen yogurt as \\"all natural.\\"[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999, Ben & Jerry's released a flavor named Schweddy Balls, in homage to the Saturday Night Live (SNL) skit of the same name. An American group named \\"One Million Moms\\" protested, saying that the name was too explicit for grocery store shelvesspokesperson Monica Cole explained to the media: \\"I realize it could be a lot worse, but are they going to progressively get worse if we don't say something? Maybe they'll think twice before they come up with another inappropriate name for ice cream.\\" However, the expression of disdain was not unanimous among U.S. parents, as mother Gina Ragusa said to The Huffington Post: \\"We just think it's funny, that's all, and honestly we all really want to try it\\", adding that she consistently checks for the item's availability at her local supermarket.[53] Actor Alec Baldwin, who appeared in the SNL skit as baker Pete Schweddy, hosted the September 24, 2011 episode of the 37th season of the show and responded to the protests by stating that a new flavor called \\"Go Fudge Yourself\\" had been produced for those in opposition to the tribute. Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that \\"thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond,\\" as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing rumors that suggested that Ben & Jerry's supported the defense of Mumia Abu-Jamalwho was convicted in 1982 of killing Philadelphia Police officer Daniel Faulkner[55]the company confirmed that Cohen did sign a petition, as a private citizen, asking that \\"the system of American justice be followed fully in the case\\".[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy emerged in 2006 after the company released a flavor of ice cream called \\"Black and Tan\\". It had named the flavor after the alcoholic drink, which is made by mixing stout with pale ale, but the \\"Black and Tans\\" are also known as a paramilitary police force of British World War I veterans recruited during the Irish Revolution. At the time that the flavor was released, the Irish nationalist movement was still offended by the historical association of the title.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, Vermonters for a Just Peace in Palestine/Israel (VTJP)[58] contacted Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and the CEO of Ben & Jerrys after learning that ice cream produced by Ben & Jerrys franchise in Israel[59] was being sold in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Leafleting occurred at locations in Vermont, New York and California on 'Free Cone Day' in April 2013[60] and April 2014.[61] As of  November 2014[update], 232 organizations across the United States and in seventeen countries worldwide have signed a letter written by VTJP calling on Ben & Jerry's to end its commercial ties to such settlements.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late April 2014, Ben & Jerry's signed onto the \\"Fight for the Reef\\" campaign, a partnership between the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS). Premier Campbell Newman and Queensland state senator Matthew Canavan both said in statements that Ben & Jerry's was making misleading statements that exaggerated the detrimental impact that proposed government programs would have on the Great Barrier Reef,[63][63] and Environment Minister Andrew Powell said that \\"The only people taking a scoop out of the reef is Ben and Jerrys and Unilever. If you understand the facts, youd want to be boycotting Ben and Jerrys\\". Australian Ben & Jerry's brand manager Kalli Swaik responded that \\"Ben & Jerrys believes that dredging and dumping in world heritage waters surrounding the marine park area will be detrimental to the reef ecology. It threatens the health of one of Australias most iconic treasures.\\"[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounder Ben Cohen created an ice cream flavor called \\"Bernie's Yearning\\" in support of U.S Senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, run for president in the 2016 Democratic Primaries against Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. The flavor consists of plain mint ice cream covered by solid chunk of chocolate. According to Cohen, \\"The chocolate disk represents the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1 percent since the end of the recession. Beneath it, the rest of us.[65] This was done in an effort to showcase the United States' current socioeconomic issues. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2016, Ben & Jerry's cofounders, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, were both arrested at the Democracy Awakening protests on the U.S. Capitol steps in Washington, D.C.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2017, Ben and Jerry's announced they would not serve two scoops of the same ice cream flavor in Australia, due to the refusal of the Australian government to legalize same-sex marriage.

Its most famous king was Cnut the Great, who gave his name to this dynasty. Other notable members were Cnut's father Sweyn Forkbeard, grandfather Harald Bluetooth, and sons Harthacnut, Harold Harefoot, and Svein Knutsson. It has also been called the House of Canute, the House of Denmark, the House of Gorm, or the Jelling dynasty.\\r\\nIn 1018 AD the House of Knytlinga brought the crowns of Denmark and England together under a personal union. At the height of its power, in the years 1028ÿ1030, the House reigned over Denmark, England and Norway. After the death of Cnut the Great's heirs within a decade of his own death and the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the legacy of the Knytlinga was largely lost to history.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe House of Knytlinga ruled the Kingdom of England from 1013 to 1014 and from 1016 to 1042.\\r\\nIn 1013 Sweyn Forkbeard, already the king of Denmark and of Norway, overthrew King ?thelred the Unready of the House of Wessex. Sweyn had first invaded England in 1003 to avenge the death of his sister Gunhilde and many other Danes in the St. Brice's Day massacre, which had been ordered by ?thelred in 1002.\\r\\nSweyn died in 1014 and ?thelred was restored. However, in 1015 Sweyn's son, Cnut the Great, invaded England. After ?thelred died in April 1016, his son Edmund Ironside briefly became king, but was forced to surrender half of England to Cnut. After Edmund died in November that same year, Cnut became king of all England.\\r\\nAlthough Cnut was already married to ?lfgifu of Northampton, he married ?thelred's widow, Emma of Normandy. He ruled until his death in 1035. After his death another of ?thelred's sons, Alfred Aetheling, tried to retake the English throne, but he was betrayed and captured by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, who supported Cnut's son, Harold Harefoot. Alfred was blinded, and died soon after.\\r\\nHarold ruled until 1040, although his mother ?lfgifu may have ruled during part of his reign.[1] Harold initially shared England with his half brother Harthacnut, the son of Cnut and Emma. Harold ruled in Mercia and Northumbria, and Harthacnut ruled in Wessex. However Harthacnut was also king of Denmark (as Cnut III), and spent most of his time there, so that Harold was effectively sole ruler of England.\\r\\nHarthacnut succeeded Harold as king of England (he is sometimes also known as Cnut II). He died two years later, and his half-brother Edward the Confessor became king. Edward was the son of ?thelred and Emma, and so with his succession to the throne the House of Wessex was restored.\\r\\nEdward the Confessor ruled until 1066.

The Keeper of the Privy Purse is Head of the Privy Purse and Treasurer's Office and has overall responsibility for the management of the sovereign's financial affairs.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1760 the monarch met all official expenses from hereditary revenues, which included the profits of the Crown Estate (the royal property portfolio). King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown in return for the Civil List, and this arrangement persisted from 1760 until 2012. The Civil List was paid from public funds and was intended to support the exercise of the monarch's duties as head of state of the United Kingdom. In modern times, the Government's profits from the Crown Estate always significantly exceeded the Civil List.[3] Under the Civil List arrangements the royal family faced criticism for the lack of transparency surrounding Royal finances.[5] The National Audit Office was not entitled to audit the Royal Household.[6]\\r\\nThe Queen received an annual S7.9 million a year from the Civil List between 2001 and 2012. The total income of the Royal Household from the Treasury was always significantly larger than the Civil List because it included additional income such as Grants-in-Aid from the Treasury and revenues from the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster.[7] The total Royal Household income for the financial years 2011-12 and 2012-13 was S30 million per annum, followed by a 14% cut in the following year.[8] However, the Treasury provided an additional S1 million to pay for Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012.[9]\\r\\nRoyal expenditure differs from income due to the use of a Reserve Fund, which can be added to or drawn from. The official reported annual expenditure of the Head of State was S41.5 million for the 2008-09 financial year. This figure did not include the cost of security provided by the police and the Army and some other expenses.[10]\\r\\nUnder the Sovereign Grant Act 2011, the system of funding the Royal Household by a mixture of Civil List payments and Grants-in-Aid was replaced. From 1 April 2012 a single annual Sovereign Grant has been paid by the Treasury. The level of funding for the Royal Household is now linked to the Government's revenue from The Crown Estate.\\r\\nThe Sovereign Grant Annual Report states that the Sovereign Grant was S31 million for 2012-13, S36.1 million for 2013-14[11] and S37.9 million for 2014-15. The amount of the Sovereign Grant is 15% of the income account net surplus of the Crown Estate for the financial year that began two years previously. The arrangements will be reviewed by 2016 (subsection 7(5) of the Act).[12] Step 4 of subsection 6(1), and subsection 6(4), of the Act provide a mechanism to prevent the amount of the Sovereign Grant increasing beyond what is necessary because of the growth in Crown Estate revenue.[13] Under the Sovereign Grant the National Audit Office is able to audit the Royal Household.\\r\\nOn November 18, 2016 a plan was announced to increase the Sovereign Grant from 15% to 25% to renovate and repair Buckingham Palace. The percentage is set to revert to 15% when the project is finished in 2027.[14]\\r\\nThe Duchy of Lancaster is the private estate of the British sovereign consisting of land holdings and other assets.[15] As it is held in perpetual trust for future generations of Sovereigns,[16] the Sovereign is not entitled to the estate's capital.[17] The revenue profits of the Duchy are presented to the Sovereign each year and form part of the Privy Purse, providing income for both the official and private expenses of the monarch.[18] In the financial year ending 31 March 2015, the Duchy was valued at S472 million, providing S16 million in income.[19]\\r\\nThe Duchy of Cornwall is a Crown entity holding land and other assets to produce an income for the monarch's eldest child. The Duke of Cornwall (Charles, Prince of Wales) receives revenue towards charitable work and official activities, supported by The Queen's Grant-in-aid funding to provide assistance with official travel and property. These financial arrangements also cover the official expenditure of some members of his immediate family. The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry all have their official expenses paid from Duchy income, assisted by grants-in aid from The Queen.[20] For the fiscal year 2011-12 the Duchy was valued at S728 million with an annual profit of S18.3 million paid to the Prince.[21]\\r\\nThe Duke of Edinburgh receives a parliamentary annuity of S359,000 per year from the Treasury.[22][23] In the past some other members of the British royal family also received funding in the form of parliamentary annuities. The Civil List Act 1952 provided for an allowance to Princess Margaret as well as allowances to the queen's younger children among others.[24][25] The Civil List Act 1972 added further members of the royal family to the annuity list.[who?][26] By 2002 there were eight recipients of parliamentary annuities (all children or cousins of the Queen)[who?] receiving a combined total of S1.5 million annually. Between 1993 and 2012 the Queen voluntarily refunded the cost of these annuities to the Treasury.[25] The Sovereign Grant Act 2011 abolished all of these other than that received by the Duke of Edinburgh.[27] Subsequently the living costs of the members of the royal family who carry out official duties, including the Princess Royal, the Duke of York, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, have mainly been met through the Queens income from the Duchy of Lancaster.[28]\\r\\nThe Crown has a legal tax-exempt status because certain acts of parliament do not apply to it. Crown bodies such as The Duchy of Lancaster are not subject to legislation concerning income tax, capital gains tax or inheritance tax. Furthermore, the Sovereign has no legal liability to pay such taxes. The Duchy of Cornwall has a Crown exemption and the Prince of Wales is not legally liable to pay income tax on Duchy revenues.\\r\\nA \\"Memorandum of Understanding on Royal Taxation\\" was published on 5 February 1993 and amended in 1996, 2009 and 2013. It is intended that the arrangements in the memorandum will be followed by the next monarch. The memorandum describes the arrangements by which The Queen and The Prince of Wales make voluntary payments to the HM Revenue and Customs in lieu of tax to compensate for their tax exemption. The details of the payments are private. The Queen voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on her private income and income from the Privy Purse (which includes the Duchy of Lancaster) that is not used for official purposes. The Sovereign Grant is exempted. A sum equivalent to capital gains tax is voluntarily paid on any gains from the disposal of private assets made after 5 April 1993. Many of the Sovereign's assets were acquired earlier than this date but payment is only made on the gains made afterwards. Arrangements also exist for a sum in lieu of inheritance tax to be voluntarily paid on some of the Queen's private assets. Property passing from monarch to monarch is exempted, as is property passing from the consort of a former monarch to the current monarch.[29]\\r\\nThe Prince of Wales voluntarily pays a sum equivalent to income tax on that part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall that is in excess of what is needed to meet official expenditure.[27] From 1969 he made voluntary tax payments of 50% of the profits, but this reduced to 25% in 1981 when he married Lady Diana Spencer.[30] These arrangements were replaced by the memorandum in 1993. The income of the Prince of Wales from sources other than the Duchy of Cornwall is subject to tax in the normal way.\\r\\nThe Queen has a private income from her personal investment portfolio,[28] though her personal wealth and income are not known.[31] Jock Colville, a former private secretary to the Queen (when she was Princess Elizabeth) and a director of her bank, Coutts, estimated her wealth at S2?million in 1971 (the equivalent of about S25?million today[32]).[33] An official statement from Buckingham Palace in 1993 called estimates of S100?million \\"grossly overstated\\".[34] In 2002, she inherited her mother's estate, thought to have been worth S70?million[35] (the equivalent of about S103?million today).[32]\\r\\nForbes magazine estimated the Queen's net worth at around $500?million (about S325?million) in 2011,[36] while an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index put it at $425?million (about S275?million) in 2015.[37] In 2012 the Sunday Times estimated the Queen's wealth as being S310 million ($504 million), and that year the Queen received a Guinness World Record as Wealthiest Queen.[38] The Sunday Times Rich List 2015 estimated her wealth at S340?million, making her the 302nd richest person in the United Kingdom; that was the first year she was not among the Sunday Times Rich List's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989.[39] She was number one on the list when it began in 1989.[39]\\r\\nSandringham House and Balmoral Castle are privately owned by the Queen.[40]\\r\\nThe Crown Estate is one of the largest property owners in the United Kingdom, producing S211 million for the Treasury in the financial year 2007ÿ8.[7] and with holdings of S7.3 billion in 2011.[41] The Crown Estate is not the private property of the Monarch. It cannot be sold or owned by the Sovereign in a private capacity,[42] nor do any revenues, or debts, from the estate accrue to her. Instead the Crown Estate is owned by the Crown, a corporation representing the legal embodiment of the State. It is held in trust and governed by Act of Parliament, to which it makes an annual report.[41] Revenue from the Crown Estate is thought to be due to double in real terms between 2010 and 2020 with additional lease revenues deriving from the development of offshore wind farms within Britain's Renewable Energy Zone,[43] the rights of which were granted to the Crown Estate by the Energy Act 2004.\\r\\nA number of State possessions are held in trust by the Sovereign.","input":"How do the royal family make their money?"},{"output":"Seventeen","context":"The Smithsonian museums are the most widely visible part of the United States' Smithsonian Institution and consist of nineteen museums and galleries as well as the National Zoological Park.[1]  Seventeen of these collections are located in Washington D.C., with eleven of those located on the National Mall.

Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the gift, which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Smithsonian Institution Building (also known as \\"The Castle\\") was completed in 1855 to house an art gallery, a library, a chemical laboratory, lecture halls, museum galleries, and offices.[4] During this time the Smithsonian was a learning institution concerned mainly with enhancing science and less interested in being a museum. Under the second secretary, Spencer Fullerton Baird, the Smithsonian turned into a full-fledged museum, mostly through the acquisition of 60 boxcars worth of displays from the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The income from the exhibition of these artifacts allowed for the construction of the National Museum, which is now known as the Arts and Industries Building. This structure was opened in 1881 to provide the Smithsonian with its first proper facility for public display of the growing collections.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Institution grew slowly until 1964 when Sidney Dillon Ripley became secretary. Ripley managed to expand the institution by eight museums and increased admission from 10.8 million to 30 million people a year.[6] This period included the greatest and most rapid growth for the Smithsonian, and it continued until Ripley's resignation in 1984.[6] Since the completion of the Arts and Industries Building, the Smithsonian has expanded to twenty separate museums with roughly 137 million objects in their collections, including works of art, natural specimens, and cultural artifacts.[1] The Smithsonian museums are visited by over 25 million people every year.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nEleven of the 19 Smithsonian Institution museums and galleries are at the National Mall in Washington D.C., the open-area national park in Washington, D.C running between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument providing a division slightly west of the center.[1] Five other Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are located elsewhere in Washington.

The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangentssmall wedges, typically made of woodagainst one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a sound board and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.\\r\\nMost hurdy-gurdies have multiple drone strings, which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody, resulting in a sound similar to that of bagpipes. For this reason, the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes, particularly in Occitan, Catalan, Cajun French and contemporary Asturian, Cantabric, Galician, and Hungarian folk music.\\r\\nMany folk music festivals in Europe feature music groups with hurdy-gurdy players. The most famous has been held since 1976 at Saint-Chartier in the Indre dpartement in Central France. In 2009, it relocated nearby to the Chateau d'Ars at La Chatre, where it continues to take place during the week nearest July 14 (Bastille Day).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from fiddles in either Europe or the Middle East (e.g., the rebab instrument) some time before the eleventh century A.D.[2] The first recorded reference to fiddles in Europe was in the 9th century by the Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911) describing the lira (lr) as a typical instrument within the Byzantine Empire.[3] One of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the organistrum, a large instrument with a guitar-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set (covering one diatonic octave). The organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings, which ran over a common bridge, and a relatively small wheel. Due to its size, the organistrum was played by two people, one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward. Pulling keys upward is cumbersome, so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum.[4]\\r\\nThe pitches on the organistrum were set according to Pythagorean temperament and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music. Abbot Odo of Cluny (died 942) is supposed to have written a short description of the construction of the organistrum entitled Quomodo organistrum construatur (How the Organistrum Is Made),[5][6] known through a much later copy, but its authenticity is very doubtful. Another 10th century treatise thought to have mentioned an instrument like a hurdy-gurdy is an Arabic musical compendium written by Al Zirikli.[2] One of the earliest visual depictions of the organistrum is from the twelfth-century 'P܇rtico da Gloria (Portal of Glory) on the cathedral at Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain: it has a carving of two musicians playing an organistrum.[7]:47[8]:3\\r\\nLater on, the organistrum was made smaller to let a single player both turn the crank and work the keys. The solo organistrum was known from Spain and France, but was largely replaced by the symphonia, a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, a new form of key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the symphonia show both types of keys.\\r\\nDuring the Renaissance, the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that buzzing bridges first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the dog) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the tromba marina (monochord), a bowed string instrument.\\r\\nDuring the late Renaissance, two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed. The first was guitar-shaped and the second had a rounded lute-type body made of staves. The lute-like body is especially characteristic of French instruments.\\r\\nBy the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German Bauernleier 'peasant's lyre' and Bettlerleier 'beggar's lyre.' During the 18th century, however, French Rococo tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is Nicolas Chdeville's Il pastor Fido, attributed to Vivaldi. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string vielle  roue. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).\\r\\nDuring this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to Central Europe, where further variations developed in western Slavic countries, German-speaking areas and Hungary (see the list of types below for more information on them). Most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century, but a few have survived. The best-known are the French vielle  roue, the Hungarian teker?lant, and the Spanish zanfo?a. In Ukraine, a variety called the lira was widely used by blind street musicians, most of whom were purged by Stalin in the 1930s (See \\"Persecuted bandurists\\")[unreliable source?].\\r\\nThe hurdy-gurdy tradition is well developed particularly in Hungary, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. In Ukraine, it is known as the lira or relia. It was and still is played by professional, often blind, itinerant musicians known as lirnyky. Their repertoire has mostly para-religious themes. Most of it originated in the Baroque period. In Eastern Ukraine, the repertoire includes unique historic epics known as dumy and folk dances.\\r\\nLirnyky were categorised as beggars by the Russian authorities and fell under harsh repressive measures if they were caught performing in the streets of major cities until 1902, when the authorities were asked by ethnographers attending the 12th All-Russian Archaeological conference to stop persecuting them.\\r\\nThe hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by Der Leiermann, the street musician portrayed in the last, melancholy song of Schubert's Winterreise. It is also featured and played prominently in the film Captains Courageous (1937) as the instrument of the character Manuel, acted by Spencer Tracy.\\r\\nThe hurdy-gurdy is played in the song \\"Hang On\\" by Weezer.\\r\\nThe instrument came into a new public consciousness when Donovan released his hit pop song, Hurdy Gurdy Man, in 1968. Although the song didn't use a hurdy-gurdy, the repeated reference to the instrument in the song's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people, eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the Olympic Peninsula area of the state of Washington each September.[9]\\r\\nToday, the tradition has resurfaced. Revivals have been underway for many years as well in Austria, Belgium and The Netherlands,[10]:85ÿ116 Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain and Sweden. As the instrument has been revived, musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music (see the list of recordings that use hurdy-gurdy), including contemporary forms not typically associated with it.\\r\\nIn the eighteenth century, the term hurdy-gurdy was also applied to a small, portable \\"barrel organ\\" (a cranked box instrument with a number of organ pipes, a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes) that was frequently played by poor buskers (street musicians). Barrel organs require only the turning of the crank to play; the music is coded by pinned barrels, perforated paper rolls, and more recently by electronic modules.[citation needed] The French call the barrel organ the Orgue de Barbarie (\\"Barbary organ\\"), and the Germans Drehorgel (\\"turned organ\\"), instead of Drehleier (\\"turning lyre\\").\\r\\nA person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a hurdy-gurdyist, or (particularly for players of French instruments) viellist.\\r\\nIn France, a player is called un sonneur de vielle (literally: \\"a sounder of vielle\\"), un vielleux or un vielleur.\\r\\nBecause of the prominence of the French tradition, many instrument and performance terms used in English are commonly taken from the French, and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature. Such common terms include the following:\\r\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the mid 18th century origin of the term hurdy-gurdy is onomatopoeic in origin, after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge.[11] Alternately, the term is thought to come from the Scottish and northern English term for uproar or disorder, hirdy-girdy[7]:41 or from hurly-burly,[7]:40 an old English term for noise or commotion. The instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a wheel fiddle in English, but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument. Another possible derivation is from the Hungarian \\"heged?s\\" (Slovenian variant \\"hrgadus\\") meaning a fiddle.[12]\\r\\nIn France, the instrument is known as vielle  roue (wheel fiddle) or simply vielle (even though there is another instrument with this name), while in the French-speaking regions of Belgium it is also known in local dialects as virlerte/virlte or tiesse di dj'va ('horse's head').[7]:38 The Flemings and the Dutch call it a draailier, which is similar to its German name, Drehleier. An alternate German name, Bauernleier, means \\"peasant's lyre\\". In Italy, it is called the ghironda or lira tedesca while in Spain, it is a zanfona, except in the Catalan region, where it is known as a viola de roda. In the Basque language, it is known as a brenka. In Portugal, it is called sanfona.[13]:211ÿ221\\r\\nThe Hungarian name teker?lant and the alternate forg܇lant both mean \\"turning lute.\\" Another Hungarian name for the instrument is nyenyere, which is thought to be an onomatopoeic reference to the repetitive warble produced by a wheel that is not even. This term was considered derogatory in the Hungarian lowlands, but was the normal term for the instrument on Csepel island directly south of Budapest.[citation needed] The equivalent names ninera and ninra are used in Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. In Russian and Ukrainian the instrument is called \\"wheel lyre\\" ( Ұ, ? ?). In Poland it is called \\"cranked lyre\\" (lira korbowa).\\r\\nLeier, lant, and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the lute or lyre family, but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments.\\r\\nIn her overview of the instrument's history, Palmer recorded twenty-three different forms,[7]:23ÿ34 and there is still no standardized design today.\\r\\nThe six-stringed French vielle  roue is the best known and most common sort. A number of regional forms developed, but outside France the instrument was considered a folk instrument and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form.\\r\\nThere are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments: guitar-bodied and lute-backed. Both forms are found in French-speaking areas, while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere. The box form of the simphonia is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors.\\r\\nHistorically, strings were made of gut, which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin (D or A) and cello (A, G, C) strings.[8]:10ÿ12 However, metal strings have become common in the twentieth century, especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used. Nylon is also sometimes used, but is disliked by many players. Some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings, generally guitar or banjo B strings.[8]:10ÿ12\\r\\nThe drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamh~r(ok)) are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.\\r\\nTo achieve proper intonation and sound quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called shimming. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.\\r\\nIn some types of hurdy-gurdy, notably the French vielle  roue ('fiddle with a wheel') and the Hungarian teker?lant (teker? for short), makers have added a buzzing bridgecalled a chien (French for dog) or recseg? (Hungarian for \\"buzzer\\")on one drone string. Modern makers have increased the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds the buzzing bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).\\r\\nThe free end of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the soundboard of the hurdy-gurdy and is more or less free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned slowly the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is accelerated, the hammer lifts up and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.\\r\\nOn French-style instruments, the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a tirant in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the trompette. The tirant adjusts the lateral pressure on the trompette and thereby sets the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge to changes in wheel velocity.\\r\\nThere are various stylistic techniques that are used as the player turns the crank, briefly accelerating the wheel at various points in its revolution. This technique is often known by its French term, the coup-de-poignet (or, more simply, the shortened coup), with the acceleration being applied by striking the handle with the thumb, fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel (often described in terms of the clock face, 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock) to achieve the desired rhythm. A long buzz can also be achieved by pulling the handle rapidly through the rotation, known as the coup gras.\\r\\nOn the Hungarian teker? the same control is achieved by using a wedge called the recseg?k (control wedge, or literally \\"buzzer wedge\\") that pushes the drone string downward. In traditional teker? playing, the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on French instruments.\\r\\nFrench type buzzing bridge\\r\\nHungarian type buzzing bridge (on a bass teker?)\\r\\nRegional types of hurdy-gurdies since the Renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence (and type) of a buzzing bridge. The following description of various types uses this framework:[14][15]:23ÿ40\\r\\nSmall-wheeled (wheel diameter less than 14?cm, or about 5.5?inches) instruments are traditionally found in Central and Eastern Europe. They feature a broad keybox and the drone strings run within the keybox. Because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.\\r\\nLarge-wheeled instruments (wheel diameters between 14 and 17?cm, or about 5.5?ÿ 6.6?inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox. They also generally have more strings and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments have as many as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.","input":"What is the origin of the hurdy gurdy?"},{"output":"King Willem-Alexander","context":"","input":"Who is the reigning monarch of the netherlands?"},{"output":"the virtue of Holiness","context":"The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser. Books I to III were first published in 1590, and then republished in 1596 together with books IV to VI. The Faerie Queene is notable for its form: it is one of the longest poems in the English language and the origin of a verse form that came to be known as Spenserian stanza.[1] On a literal level, the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues, though it is primarily an allegorical work, and can be read on several levels of allegory, including as praise (or, later, criticism) of Queen Elizabeth I. In Spenser's \\"Letter of the Authors\\" he states that the entire epic poem is \\"cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devises,\\" and that the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to \\"fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline\\".[2]\\r\\nThe Faerie Queene found such favor with Elizabeth I that Spenser was granted a pension for life amounting to S50 a year, though there is no evidence that Elizabeth read any of the poem. This royal patronage helped the poem to such a level of success that it became Spenser's defining work.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBook I is centered on the virtue of Holiness as embodied in the Redcross Knight. He and his lady Una travel together as he fights the dragon Errour, then separate as the wizard Archimago tricks the Redcross Knight in a dream to think that Una is unchaste. After he leaves, the Redcross Knight meets Duessa, who feigns distress in order to entrap him. Duessa leads the Redcross Knight to captivity by the giant Orgoglio. Meanwhile, Una overcomes peril, meets Arthur, and finally finds the Redcross Knight and rescues him from his capture, from Duessa, and from Despair. Una and Arthur help the Redcross Knight recover in the House of Holiness, with the House's ruler Caelia and her three daughters joining them; there the Redcross Knight sees a vision of his future. He then returns Una to her parents' castle and rescues them from a dragon, and the two are betrothed after resisting Archimago one last time.\\r\\nBook II is centred on the virtue of Temperance as embodied in Sir Guyon, who is tempted by the fleeing Archimago into nearly attacking the Redcross Knight. Guyon discovers a woman killing herself out of grief for having her lover tempted and bewitched by the witch Acrasia and killed. Guyon swears a vow to avenge them and protect their child. Guyon on his quest starts and stops fighting several evil, rash, or tricked knights and meets Arthur. Finally, they come to Acrasia's Island and the Bower of Bliss, where Guyon resists temptations to violence, idleness, and lust. Guyon captures Acrasia in a net, destroys the Bower, and rescues those imprisoned there.\\r\\nBook III is centred on the virtue of Chastity as embodied in Britomart, a lady knight. Resting after the events of Book II, Guyon and Arthur meet Britomart, who wins a joust with Guyon. They separate as Arthur and Guyon leave to rescue Florimell, while Britomart rescues the Redcross Knight. Britomart reveals to the Redcrosse Knight that she is pursuing Sir Artegal because she is destined to marry him. The Redcross Knight defends Artegal and they meet Merlin, who explains more carefully Britomart's destiny to found the English monarchy. Britomart leaves and fights Sir Marinell. Arthur looks for Florimell, joined later by Sir Satyrane and Britomart, and they witness and resist sexual temptation. Britomart separates from them and meets Sir Scudamore, looking for his captured lady Amoret. Britomart alone is able to rescue Amoret from the wizard Busirane. Unfortunately, when they emerge from the castle Scudamore is gone. (The 1590 version with Books I-III depicts the lovers' happy reunion, but this was changed in the 1596 version which contained all six books)\\r\\nBook IV, despite its title The Legend of Cambell and Telamond or Of Friendship, Cambells companion in Book IV is actually named Triamond, and the plot does not center on their friendship; the two men appear only briefly in the story. The book is largely a continuation of events begun in Book III. First, Scudamore is convinced by the hag Ate (discord) that Britomart has run off with Amoret and becomes jealous. A three-day tournament is then held by Satyrane, where Britomart beats Arthegal (both in disguise). Scudamore and Arthegal unite against Britomart, but when her helmet comes off in battle Arthegal falls in love with her. He surrenders, removes his helmet, and Britomart recognizes him as the man in the enchanted mirror. Arthegal pledges his love to her but must first leave and complete his quest. Scudamore, upon discovering Britomarts gender, realizes his mistake and asks after his lady, but by this time Britomart has lost Amoret, and she and Scudamore embark together on a search for her. The reader discovers that Amoret was abducted by a savage man and is imprisoned in his cave. One day Amoret darts out past the savage and is rescued from him by the squire Timias and Belphoebe. Arthur then appears, offering his service as a knight to the lost woman. She accepts, and after a couple of trials on the way, Arthur and Amoret finally happen across Scudamore and Britomart. The two lovers are reunited. Wrapping up a different plotline from Book III, the recently recovered Marinel discovers Florimell suffering in Proteus dungeon. He returns home and becomes sick with love and pity. Eventually he confesses his feelings to his mother, and she pleads with Neptune to have the girl released, which the god grants.\\r\\nBook V is centred on the virtue of Justice as embodied in Sir Artegal.\\r\\nBook VI is centred on the virtue of Courtesy as embodied in Sir Calidore.\\r\\nA letter written by Spenser to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1590[4] contains a preface for The Faerie Queene, in which Spenser describes the allegorical presentation of virtues through Arthurian knights in the mythical \\"Faerieland\\". Presented as a preface to the epic in most published editions, this letter outlines plans for twenty-four books: twelve based each on a different knight who exemplified one of twelve \\"private virtues\\", and a possible twelve more centred on King Arthur displaying twelve \\"public virtues\\". Spenser names Aristotle as his source for these virtues, though the influences of Thomas Aquinas and the traditions of medieval allegory can be observed as well.[5] It is impossible to predict how the work would have looked had Spenser lived to complete it, since the reliability of the predictions made in his letter to Raleigh is not absolute, as numerous divergences from that scheme emerged as early as 1590 in the first Faerie Queene publication.\\r\\nIn addition to the six virtues Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice, and Courtesy, the Letter to Raleigh suggests that Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence, which (\\"according to Aristotle and the rest\\") is \\"the perfection of all the rest, and containeth in it them all\\"; and that the Faerie Queene herself represents Glory (hence her name, Gloriana). The unfinished seventh book (the Cantos of Mutability) appears to have represented the virtue of \\"constancy.\\"\\r\\nThe Faerie Queene was written during the Reformation, a time of religious and political controversy. After taking the throne following the death of her half-sister Mary, Elizabeth changed the official religion of the nation to Protestantism.[6] The plot of book one is similar to Foxe's Book of Martyrs, which was about the persecution of the Protestants and how Catholic rule was unjust.[7] Spenser includes the controversy of Elizabethan church reform within the epic. Gloriana has godly English knights destroy Catholic continental power in Books I and V.[8] Spenser also endows many of his villains with \\"the worst of what Protestants considered a superstitious Catholic reliance on deceptive images\\".[9]\\r\\nThe poem celebrates, memorializes, and critiques the House of Tudor (of which Elizabeth was a part), much as Virgil's Aeneid celebrates Augustus' Rome. The Aeneid states that Augustus descended from the noble sons of Troy; similarly, The Faerie Queene suggests that the Tudor lineage can be connected to King Arthur. The poem is deeply allegorical and allusive; many prominent Elizabethans could have found themselves partially represented by one or more of Spenser's figures. Elizabeth herself is the most prominent example. She appears in the guise of Gloriana, the Faerie Queen, but also in Books III and IV as the virgin Belphoebe, daughter of Chrysogonee and twin to Amoret, the embodiment of womanly married love. Perhaps also, more critically, Elizabeth is seen in Book I as Lucifera, the \\"maiden queen\\" whose brightly lit Court of Pride masks a dungeon full of prisoners.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe poem also displays Spenser's thorough familiarity with literary history. The world of The Faerie Queene is based on English Arthurian legend, but much of the language, spirit, and style of the piece draw more on Italian epic, particularly Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso and Torquato Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered.[10] Book V of The Faerie Queene, the Book of Justice, is Spenser's most direct discussion of political theory. In it, Spenser attempts to tackle the problem of policy toward Ireland and recreates the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome literary works sacrifice historical context to archetypal myth, reducing poetry to Biblical quests, whereas Spenser reinforces the actuality of his story by adhering to archetypal patterns.[11] Throughout The Faerie Queene, Spenser does not concentrate on a pattern \\"which transcends time\\" but \\"uses such a pattern to focus the meaning of the past on the present\\".[11] By reflecting on the past, Spenser achieves ways of stressing the importance of Elizabeth's reign. In turn, he does not \\"convert event into myth\\" but \\"myth into event\\".[11] Within The Faerie Queene, Spenser blurs the distinction between archetypal and historical elements deliberately. For example, Spenser probably does not believe in the complete truth of the British Chronicle, which Arthur reads in the House of Alma.[11] In this instance, the Chronicle serves as a poetical equivalent for factual history. Even so, poetical history of this kind is not myth; rather, it \\"consists of unique, if partially imaginary, events recorded in chronological order\\".[11] The same distinction resurfaces in the political allegory of Books I and V. However, the reality to interpreted events becomes more apparent when the events occurred nearer to the time when the poem was written.[11]\\r\\nThroughout The Faerie Queene, Spenser creates \\"a network of allusions to events, issues, and particular persons in England and Ireland\\" including Mary, Queen of Scots, the Spanish Armada, the English Reformation, and even the Queen herself.[12] It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem, and was very insulted by Duessa ÿ a very negative depiction of his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots.[13] The Faerie Queene was then banned in Scotland. This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth's support for the poem.[13] Within the text, both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth, some of which are \\"far from complimentary\\".[12]\\r\\nThough it praises her in some ways, The Faerie Queene questions Elizabeth's ability to rule so effectively because of her gender, and also inscribes the \\"shortcomings\\" of her rule.[14] There is a character named Britomart who represents married chastity. This character is told that her destiny is to be an \\"immortal womb\\" ÿ to have children.[14] Here, Spenser is referring to Elizabeth's unmarried state and is touching on anxieties of the 1590s about what would happen after her death since the kingdom had no heir.[14]\\r\\nThe Faerie Queene's original audience would have been able to identify many of the poem's characters by analyzing the symbols and attributes that spot Spenser's text. For example, readers would immediately know that \\"a woman who wears scarlet clothes and resides along the Tiber River represents the Roman Catholic Church\\".[12] However, marginal notes jotted in early copies of The Faerie Queene suggest that Spenser's contemporaries were unable to come to a consensus about the precise historical referents of the poem's \\"myriad figures\\".[12] In fact, Sir Walter Raleigh's wife identified many of the poem's female characters as \\"allegorical representations of herself\\".[12] Other symbols prevalent in The Faerie Queene are the numerous animal characters present in the novel. They take the role of \\"visual figures in the allegory and in illustrative similes and metaphors\\".[15] Specific examples include the swine present in Lucifera's castle who embodied gluttony, and Duessa, the deceitful crocodile who may represent Mary, Queen of Scots, in a negative light.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe House of Busirane episode in Book III in The Faerie Queene is partially based on an early modern English folktale called \\"Mr. Fox's Mottos.\\" In the tale, a young woman named Lady Mary has been enticed by Mr. Fox, who resembles Bluebeard in his manner of killing his wives. She defeats Mr. Fox and tells about his deeds. Notably, Spenser quotes the story as Britomart makes her way through the House, with warning mottos above each doorway \\"Be bold, be bold, but not too bold.\\" [16]\\r\\nWhile writing his poem, Spenser strove to avoid 'gealous opinions and misconstructions\\" because he thought it would place his story in a \\"better light\\" for his readers.[17] Spencer stated in his letter to Raleigh, published with the first three books,[14] that \\"the general end of the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline\\".[17] Spenser considered his work \\"a historical fiction\\" which men should read for \\"delight\\" rather than \\"the profit of the ensample\\".[17] The Faerie Queene was written for Elizabeth to read and was dedicated to her. However, there are dedicatory sonnets in the first edition to many powerful Elizabethan figures.[18]\\r\\nSpenser addresses \\"lodwick\\" in Amoretti 33, when talking about The Faerie Queene still being incomplete. This could be either his friend Lodowick Bryskett or his long deceased Italian model Ludovico Ariosto, whom he praises in \\"Letter to Raleigh\\".[19]\\r\\nThe poem is dedicated to Elizabeth I who is represented in the poem as the Faerie Queene Gloriana, as well as the character Belphoebe.[20] Spenser prefaces the poem with sonnets additionally dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton, Lord Burleigh, the Earl of Oxford, the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Cumberland, the Earl of Essex, the Earl of Ormond and Ossory, High Admiral Charles Howard, Lord Hunsdon, Lord Grey of Wilton, Lord Buckhurst, Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir John Norris, Sir Walter Raleigh, the Countess of Pembroke (on the subject of her brother Sir Philip Sidney), and Lady Carew.\\r\\nIn October 1589, Spenser voyaged to England and saw the Queen. It is possible that he read to her from his manuscript at this time. On 25 February 1591, the Queen gave him a pension of fifty pounds per year.[21] He was paid in four instalments on 25 March, 24 June, 29 September, and 25 December.[22] After the first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in 1590, Spenser found himself disappointed in the monarchy; among other things, \\"his annual pension from the Queen was smaller than he would have liked\\" and his humanist perception of Elizabeth's court \\"was shattered by what he saw there\\".[23] Despite these frustrations, however, Spenser \\"kept his aristocratic prejudices and predispositions\\".[23] Book VI stresses that there is \\"almost no correlation between noble deeds and low birth\\" and reveals that to be a \\"noble person,\\" one must be a \\"gentleman of choice stock\\".[23]\\r\\nThroughout The Faerie Queene, virtue is seen as \\"a feature for the nobly born\\" and within Book VI, readers encounter worthy deeds that indicate aristocratic lineage.[23] An example of this is the hermit to whom Arthur brings Timias and Serena. Initially, the man is considered a \\"goodly knight of a gentle race\\" who \\"withdrew from public service to religious life when he grew too old to fight\\".[23] Here, we note the hermit's noble blood seems to have influenced his gentle, selfless behaviour. Likewise, audiences acknowledge that young Tristram \\"speaks so well and acts so heroically\\" that Calidore \\"frequently contributes him with noble birth\\" even before learning his background; in fact, it is no surprise that Tristram turns out to be the son of a king, explaining his profound intellect.[24] However, Spenser's most peculiar example of noble birth is demonstrated through the characterization of the Salvage Man. Using the Salvage Man as an example, Spenser demonstrated that \\"ungainly appearances do not disqualify one from noble birth\\".[24] By giving the Salvage Man a \\"frightening exterior,\\" Spenser stresses that \\"virtuous deeds are a more accurate indication of gentle blood than physical appearance.[24]\\r\\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, The Faerie Queene indicates qualities such as cowardice and discourtesy that signify low birth. During his initial encounter with Arthur, Turpine \\"hides behind his retainers, chooses ambush from behind instead of direct combat, and cowers to his wife, who covers him with her voluminous skirt\\".[25] These actions demonstrate that Turpine is \\"morally emasculated by fear\\" and furthermore, \\"the usual social roles are reversed as the lady protects the knight from danger.[25] Scholars believe that this characterization serves as \\"a negative example of knighthood\\" and strives to teach Elizabethan aristocrats how to \\"identify a commoner with political ambitions inappropriate to his rank\\".[25]\\r\\nThe Faerie Queene was written in Spenserian stanza, which was created specifically for The Faerie Queene. In this style, there are nine iambic lines ÿ the first eight of them five footed and the ninth a hexameter ÿ which form \\"interlocking quatrains and a final couplet\\".[26] The rhyme pattern is ABABBCBCC. Over two thousand stanzas were written for the 1590 Faerie Queene.[26] Many see Spenser's purposeful use of archaic language as an intentional means of aligning himself with Chaucer and placing himself within a trajectory of building English national literary history.\\r\\nIn Elizabethan England, no subject was more familiar to writers than theology. Elizabethans learned to embrace religious studies in petty school, where they \\"read from selections from the Book of Common Prayer and memorized Catechisms from the Scriptures\\".[27] This influence is evident in Spenser's text, as demonstrated in the moral allegory of Book I. Here, allegory is organized in the traditional arrangement of Renaissance theological treatises and confessionals. While reading Book I, audiences first encounter original sin, justification and the nature of sin before analysing the church and the sacraments.[28] Despite this pattern, Book I is not a theological treatise; within the text, \\"moral and historical allegories intermingle\\" and the reader encounters elements of romance.[29] However, Spenser's method is not \\"a rigorous and unyielding allegory,\\" but \\"a compromise among conflicting elements\\".[29] In Book I of The Faerie Queene the discussion of the path to salvation begins with original sin and justification, skipping past initial matters of God, the Creeds, and Adam's fall from grace.[29] This literary decision is pivotal because these doctrines \\"center the fundamental theological controversies of the Reformation\\".[29]\\r\\nDuring The Faerie Queene's inception, Spenser worked as a civil servant, in \\"relative seclusion from the political and literary events of his day\\".[30] As Spenser laboured in solitude, The Faerie Queene manifested within his mind, blending his experiences into the content of his craft. Within his poem, Spenser explores human consciousness and conflict, relating to a variety of genres including sixteenth century Arthurian literature.[31] The Faerie Queene was influenced strongly by Italian works, as were many other works in England at that time. The Faerie Queene draws heavily on Ariosto and Tasso.[32]\\r\\nThe first three books of The Faerie Queene operate as a unit, representing the entire cycle from the fall of Troy to the reign of Elizabeth.[31] Using in medias res, Spenser introduces his historical narrative at three different intervals, using chronicle, civil conversation, and prophecy as its occasions.[31]\\r\\nDespite the historical elements of his text, Spenser is careful to label himself a historical poet as opposed to a historiographer. Spenser notes this differentiation in his letter to Raleigh, noting \\"a Historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were donebut a Poet thrusteth into the midstand maketh a pleasing Analysis of all\\".[33]\\r\\nSpenser's characters embody Elizabethan values, highlighting political and aesthetic associations of Tudor Arthurian tradition in order to bring his work to life. While Spenser respected British history and \\"contemporary culture confirmed his attitude\\",[33] his literary freedom demonstrates that he was \\"working in the realm of mythopoeic imagination rather than that of historical fact\\".[33] In fact, Spenser's Arthurian material serves as a subject of debate, intermediate between \\"legendary history and historical myth\\" offering him a range of \\"evocative tradition and freedom that historian's responsibilities preclude\\".[34] Concurrently, Spenser adopts the role of a sceptic, reflected in the way in which he handles the British history, which \\"extends to the verge of self-satire\\".[35]\\r\\nThe Faerie Queene owes, in part, its central figure, Arthur, to a medieval writer, Geoffrey of Monmouth. In his Prophetiae Merlini (\\"Prophecies of Merlin\\"), Geoffrey's Merlin proclaims that the Saxons will rule over the Britons until the \\"Boar of Cornwall\\" (Arthur) again restores them to their rightful place as rulers.[36] The prophecy was adopted by the Welsh and eventually used by the Tudors. Through their ancestor, Owen Tudor, the Tudors had Welsh blood, through which they claimed to be descendants of Arthur and rightful rulers of Britain.[37] The tradition begun by Geoffrey of Monmouth set the perfect atmosphere for Spenser's choice of Arthur as the central figure and natural bridegroom of Gloriana.\\r\\nSince its inception four centuries ago, Spenser's diction has been scrutinized by scholars. Despite the enthusiasm the poet and his work received, Spenser's experimental diction was \\"largely condemned\\" before it received the acclaim it has today.[38] Seventeenth century philologists such as Davenant considered Spenser's use of \\"obsolete language\\" \\"the most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge\\".[39] Scholars have recently observed that the classical tradition tucked within The Faerie Queene is related to the problem of his diction because it \\"involves the principles of imitation and decorum\\".[40] Despite these initial criticisms, Spenser is \\"now recognized as a conscious literary artist\\" and his language is deemed \\"the only fitting vehicle for his tone of thought and feelings\\".[40] Spenser's use of language was widely contrasted to that of \\"free and unregulated\\" sixteenth century Shakespearian grammar.[41] Spenser's style is standardized, lyrically sophisticated, and full of archaisms that give the poem an original taste. Sugden argues in The grammar of Spenser's Faerie Queene that the archaisms reside \\"chiefly in vocabulary, to a high degree in spelling, to some extent in the inflexions, and only slightly in the syntax\\".[41]\\r\\nSamuel Johnson also commented critically on Spenser's diction, with which he became intimately acquainted during his work on A Dictionary of the English Language, and \\"found it a useful source for obsolete and archaic words\\"; Johnson, however, mainly considered Spenser's (early) pastoral poems, a genre of which he was not particularly fond.[42]\\r\\nThe diction and atmosphere of The Faerie Queene relied on much more than just Middle English; for instance, classical allusions and classical proper names aboundespecially in the later booksand he coined some names based on Greek, such as \\"Poris\\" and \\"Phao lilly white.\\"[43] Classical material is also alluded to or reworked by Spenser, such as the rape of Lucretia, which was reworked into the story of the character Amavia in Book Two.[44]\\r\\nSpenser's language in The Faerie Queene, as in The Shepheardes Calender, is deliberately archaic, though the extent of this has been exaggerated by critics who follow Ben Jonson's dictum, that \\"in affecting the ancients Spenser writ no language.\\"[45] Allowing that Jonson's remark may only apply to the Calendar, Bruce Robert McElderry, Jr., states, after a detailed investigation of the FQ's diction, that Jonson's statement \\"is a skillful epigram; but it seriously misrepresents the truth if taken at anything like its face value.\\"[46] The number of archaisms used in the poem is not overwhelmingone source reports thirty-four in Canto I of Book I, that is, thirty-four words out of a total forty-two hundred words, less than one percent.[47] According to McElderry, language does not account for the poem's archaic tone: \\"The subject-matter of The Faerie Queene is itself the most powerful factor in creating the impression of archaism.\\"[48]\\r\\nExamples of medieval archaisms (in morphology and diction) include:","input":"What does the redcrosse knight represent in the faerie queene?"},{"output":"Soviet Union","context":"","input":"What were the two super powers during the cold war?"},{"output":"Volkswagen AG","context":"Volkswagen AG (German: [?f?lks?va?gn?]), known internationally as Volkswagen Group, is a German multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany.

In 2016, it was the world's largest automaker by sales, overtaking Toyota and keeping this title in 2017, selling 10.7 million vehicles.[9] It has maintained the largest market share in Europe for over two decades.[10] It ranked sixth in the 2017 Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies. Volkswagen Group sells passenger cars under the Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, ?koda and Volkswagen marques; motorcycles under the Ducati brand; and commercial vehicles under the marques MAN, Scania, and Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles. It is divided into two primary divisions, the Automotive Division and the Financial Services Division, and as of 2008 had approximately 342 subsidiary companies.[11] VW also has two major joint-ventures in China (FAW-Volkswagen and SAIC Volkswagen). The company has operations in approximately 150 countries and operates 100 production facilities across 27 countries.\\r\\nVolkswagen was founded in 1937, to manufacture the car which would become known as the Beetle. The company's production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1965 it acquired Auto Union, which subsequently produced the first post-war Audi models. Volkswagen launched a new generation of front-wheel drive vehicles in the 1970s, including the Passat, Polo and Golf; the latter became its bestseller. Volkswagen acquired a controlling stake in SEAT in 1986, making it the first non-German marque of the company, and acquired control of ?koda in 1994, of Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti in 1998, Scania in 2008 and of Ducati, MAN and Porsche in 2012. The company's operations in China have grown rapidly in the past decade with the country becoming its largest market.\\r\\nVolkswagen Aktiengesellschaft is a public company and has a primary listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index, and secondary listings on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, SIX Swiss Exchange. It has been traded in the United States via American depositary receipts since 1988, currently on the OTC Marketplace. Volkswagen delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[1][12] The state of Lower Saxony holds 12.7% of the company's shares, granting it 20% of the voting rights.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nVolkswagen was founded on 28 May 1937 in Berlin as the Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung des Deutschen Volkswagens mbH (\\"Limited Liability Company for the preparation of the German People's Car\\", abbreviated to Gezuvor) by the National Socialist Deutsche Arbeitsfront (German Labour Front).[14][15][16] The purpose of the company was to manufacture the Volkswagen car, originally referred to as the Porsche Type 60, then the Volkswagen Type 1, and commonly called the Volkswagen Beetle.[17] This vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Porsche's consulting firm, and the company was backed by the support of Adolf Hitler.[18] On 16 September 1938, Gezuvor was renamed Volkswagenwerk GmbH (\\"Volkswagen Factory limited liability company\\").[14]\\r\\nShortly after the factory near Fallersleben was completed, World War II started and the plant primarily manufactured the military Kbelwagen (Porsche Type 82) and the related amphibious Schwimmwagen (Type 166), both of which were derived from the Volkswagen. Only a small number of Type 60 Volkswagens were made during this time. The Fallersleben plant also manufactured the V-1 flying bomb, making the plant a major bombing target for the Allied forces.\\r\\nAfter the war in Europe, in June 1945, Major Ivan Hirst[17] of the British Army Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) took control of the bomb-shattered factory, and restarted production, pending the expected disposal of the plant as war reparations. However, no British car manufacturer was interested; \\"the vehicle does not meet the fundamental technical requirement of a motor-car ... it is quite unattractive to the average buyer ... To build the car commercially would be a completely uneconomic enterprise\\".[19] In 1948, the Ford Motor Company of USA was offered Volkswagen, but Ernest Breech, a Ford executive vice president said he didn't think either the plant or the car was \\"worth a damn.\\"[20] Breech later said that he would have considered merging Ford of Germany and Volkswagen, but after the war, ownership of the company was in such dispute that nobody could possibly hope to be able to take it over. As part of the Industrial plans for Germany, large parts of German industry, including Volkswagen, were to be dismantled. Total German car production was set at a maximum of 10% of the 1936 car production numbers.[21] The company survived by producing cars for the British Army, and in 1948 the British Government handed the company back over to the German state, and it was managed by former Opel chief Heinrich Nordhoff.\\r\\nProduction of the Type 60 Volkswagen (re-designated Type 1) started slowly after the war due to the need to rebuild the plant and because of the lack of raw materials, but production grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s. The company began introducing new models based on the Type 1, all with the same basic air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-drive platform. These included the Volkswagen Type 2 in 1950, the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia in 1955, the Volkswagen Type 3 in 1961, the Volkswagen Type 4 in 1968, and the Volkswagen Type 181 in 1969.\\r\\nIn 1960, upon the flotation of part of the German federal government's stake in the company on the German stock market, its name became Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft (usually abbreviated to Volkswagenwerk AG).\\r\\nOn 1 January 1965, Volkswagenwerk acquired Auto Union GmbH from its parent company Daimler-Benz. The new subsidiary went on to produce the first post-war Audi models, the Audi F103 series, shortly afterwards.[22]\\r\\nAnother German manufacturer, NSU Motorenwerke AG, was merged into Auto Union on 26 August 1969, creating a new company, Audi NSU Auto Union AG (later renamed AUDI AG in 1985).[22]\\r\\nFrom the late 1970s to 1992, the acronym V.A.G was used by Volkswagen AG as a brand for group-wide activities, such as distribution and leasing. Contrary to popular belief, \\"V.A.G\\" had no official meaning, and was never the name of the Volkswagen Group.[23]\\r\\nOn 30 September 1982, Volkswagenwerk made its first step expanding outside Germany by signing a co-operation agreement with the Spanish car manufacturer SEAT, S.A.[22]\\r\\nIn order to reflect the company's increasing global diversification from its headquarters and main plant (the Volkswagenwerk in Wolfsburg), on 4 July 1985, the company name was changed again?ÿ to Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (Volkswagen AG).\\r\\nOn 18 June 1986, Volkswagen AG acquired a 51% controlling stake in SEAT, making it the first non-German subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group. On 23 December the same year, it became the Spanish company's major shareholder by increasing its share up to 75%.[22]\\r\\nIn 1990?ÿ after purchasing its entire equity?ÿ Volkswagen AG took over the full ownership of SEAT, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary, and on 28 March 1991 another step to the expansion of the group's activities was made through the signing of a joint venture partnership agreement with ?koda automobilov a.s. of Czechoslovakia, accompanied with the acquisition of a 30% stake in the Czech car manufacturer,[22] raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3% and the year after, on 11 December 1995, to 70% of its shares.[24]\\r\\nThree prestige automotive marques were added to the Volkswagen portfolio in 1998: Bentley, Lamborghini and Bugatti.[22]\\r\\nOn 30 May 2000, Volkswagen AG, after having gradually raised its equity share, turned ?koda Auto into a wholly owned subsidiary.[22]\\r\\nFrom 2002 up to 2007, the Volkswagen Group's automotive division was restructured so that two major Brand Groups with differentiated profile would be formed,[25] the Audi Brand Group focused on more sporty values?ÿ consisted of Audi, SEAT and Lamborghini?ÿ and the Volkswagen Brand Group on the field of classic values?ÿ consisted of Volkswagen, Skoda, Bentley and Bugatti[26][27]?ÿ with each Brand Group's product vehicles and performance being respectively under the higher responsibility of Audi and Volkswagen brands.\\r\\nVolkswagen Group revealed on 24 October 2009 that it had made an offer to acquire long-time partner and German niche automotive manufacturer Wilhelm Karmann GmbH out of bankruptcy protection.[28] In November 2009, the Supervisory Board of Volkswagen AG approved the acquisition of assets of Karmann, and planned to restart vehicle production at their Osnabrck plant in 2012.[29]\\r\\nIn December 2009, Volkswagen AG bought a 49.9% stake in Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG (more commonly known as Porsche AG) in a first step towards an 'integrated automotive group' with Porsche.[30][31][32] The merger of Volkswagen AG and Porsche SE was scheduled to take place during the course of 2011. On 8 September 2011, it was announced that the planned merger \\"cannot be implemented within the time frame provided for in the Comprehensive Agreement.\\" As reasons, unquantifiable legal risks, including a criminal probe into the holding's former management team were given. Both parties \\"remain committed to the goal of creating an integrated automotive group with Porsche and are convinced that this will take place.\\"[33][34] On 4 July 2012 Volkswagen group announced they would wrap up the remaining half of Porsche shares for 4.46 billion euros ($5.58 billion) on 1 August 2012 to avoid taxes of as much as 1.5 billion euros, which would have to be paid if the wrap up happened after 31 July 2014.[35] Volkswagen AG purchased the remaining stake in Porsche AG equaling 100% of the shares in Porsche Zwischenholding GmbH, effectively becoming its parent company as of 1 August 2012.[36]\\r\\nVolkswagen AG completed the purchase of 19.9% of Suzuki Motor Corporation's issued shares on 15 January 2010.[37][38] Suzuki invested part of the amount received from Volkswagen into 1.49% percent of Volkswagen.[39] In 2011, Suzuki filed a lawsuit at an arbitration court in London requesting that Volkswagen return the 19.9% stake.[40]\\r\\nOn 25 May 2010, it was announced that Volkswagen Group, through it subsidiary Lamborghini Holding S.p.A., had acquired a 90.1% stake in the Italian automotive design house Italdesign Giugiaro.[41] In only less than three months, the transaction had been completed making the Italian firm a member of the Volkswagen Group.[42]\\r\\nIn 2015 research showed a security flaw in the keyless ignition of Volkswagen and other carmakers' vehicles.

An international arbitration court ordered Volkswagen to sell the stake back to Suzuki.[45] Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete the stock buy-back just hours prior to a major scandal about emissions violations engulfing Volkswagen. Suzuki had wished to buy Fiat diesel engines.[46] On 17 September 2015, Suzuki paid $3.8bn to complete a stock buy-back just hours prior to news broke out regarding the Volkswagen common-rail TDI engine emissions scandal which engulfed Volkswagen.[46]\\r\\nOn 18 September 2015, The US EPA announced that Volkswagen had installed a \\"defeat device\\" software code in the diesel models sold in the US from 2009-15.[47] The code was intended to detect when an emissions test was being conducted, and altered emissions controls for better compliance. Off the test stand, the controls were relaxed, and emissions jumped 35 to 40 times regulatory levels according to investigators at West Virginia University and the California Air Resources Board. 482,000 vehicles are under the recall order, a potential $18 billion ($37,500 per violation) in fines are pending, and news accounts speculate a criminal indictment for the deception is certain.[48][49] The VW Group CEO, Martin Winterkorn, said he was \\"deeply sorry\\" and ordered an external investigation.[50] The software code was only revealed when the EPA refused to certify VW's 2016 models for sale in the US unless the corporation provided full disclosure.[51] On Sunday, 20 September 2015, VW Group announced it was halting the sale of its four-cylinder diesel models in the US.[52] The US EPA press release on its Notice of Violation,[47] and the California Air Resources Board letter[53] dated 18 September 2015 contain significant chronological detail of the agencies interaction with VW on the issue.\\r\\nOn 22 September 2015, VW AG admitted that 11 million cars worldwide had been fitted with software intended to deceive emissions testing. The company issued a profit warning, saying it had set aside 7.3 billion dollars to fix the fraud.[54] On 23 September 2015, Martin Winterkorn announced his resignation from the CEO position after a crisis meeting of the company board;.[55] On 25 September 2015 Matthias Mller was named CEO.[56] Mr. Mller was the head of the Porsche marque within the VW corporate umbrella.[57]\\r\\nOn April 21, 2017, a US federal judge ordered Volkswagen \\"to pay a $2.8 billion criminal fine for rigging diesel-powered vehicles to cheat on government emissions tests.\\" The \\"unprecedented\\" plea deal formalized a punishment that Volkswagen AG agreed to earlier in 2017.[58]\\r\\nIn 2016, Volkswagen Group announced a corporate \\"Strategy 2025\\" that aims to offer 20 new electric cars or plug-in hybrid models by 2020 and 30 all-electric models by 2025. The electric cars will utilize the Volkswagen Group MEB platform chassis for all forms and types of cars and light utility vehicles across several VW Group marques due to its flexibility and floor-mounted battery.[59][60]\\r\\nIn June 2016, it was apparent that Deutsche Post/DHL Express - which operates a fleet of approximately 70,000 vehicles worldwide -- would be replacing many of the Volkswagen Caddy vehicles with electric StreetScooter vans made by their own subsidiary over the subsequent years. The company had also begun to market the StreetScooter to other potential customers.[61] VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller admitted annoyance. \\"I, of course, ask myself why Post did not talk to our VW Commercial vehicles division about doing something similar. Let's see if we can still get a foot in the door there.\\"[62]\\r\\nRooted in Europe, the Volkswagen Group operates in 153 countries.[63] Volkswagen Passenger Cars is the Group's original marque, and the other major subsidiaries include passenger car marques such as Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, and ?koda. Volkswagen AG also has operations in commercial vehicles, owning Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, along with controlling stakes in truck, bus and diesel engine manufacturers Scania AB and MAN SE.[64]\\r\\nThe Volkswagen Group comprises 12 principal vehicle manufacturers and their corresponding marques:\\r\\nThe Group also owns five defunct marques which are managed through the companies Auto Union GmbH and NSU GmbH, both of which are 100% owned by AUDI AG:\\r\\nOther subsidiaries:\\r\\nUnder the Volkswagen Law, no shareholder in Volkswagen AG could exercise more than 20?percent of the firm's voting rights, regardless of their level of stock holding.[71] This law was supposed to protect Volkswagen Group from takeovers.[72] In October 2005, Porsche acquired an 18.53?percent stake in the business, and in July 2006, Porsche increased that ownership to more than 25?percent. Analysts disagreed as to whether the investment was a good fit for Porsche's strategy.[73]\\r\\nOn 26 March 2007, after the European Union moved against the Volkswagen law, Porsche took its holding to 30.9?percent, triggering a takeover bid under German law. Porsche formally announced in a press statement that it did not intend to take over Volkswagen Group, setting its offer price at the lowest possible legal value, but intended the move to avoid a competitor taking a large stake, or to stop hedge funds dismantling Volkswagen Group, which is Porsche's most important partner.[74] On 16 September 2008, Porsche announced that the company had increased its stake in Volkswagen AG to 35?percent.[75] By October 2008, Porsche held 42.6?percent of Volkswagen AG's ordinary shares, and held stock options on another 31.5?percent.[76] thus, effectively holding over 74?percent; 42.6?percent actual shares, and the rest as convertible options.[77] Volkswagen AG briefly became the world's most valuable company, as the stock price rose to over ?1,000 per share as short sellers tried to cover their positions[78] The substantial investment in Volkswagen left Porsche with huge financial burden with its debts accumulating up to 13 billion euros by 2009.[79] Porsche would get emergency infusion of about a billion dollars from Volkswagen.[80] In July 2012, Volkswagen completed takeover of Porsche ending the 4 year saga and formed an integrated automotive group with Porsche. Porsche AG would become the 10th brand of Volkswagen. The holding company Porsche SE owns 31 percent shares of Volkswagen AG while maintaining its 50.7 percent of voting rights in the company.[81]\\r\\nAs of 31?December?2016[update], share ownership of Volkswagen AG is distributed as follows:[6]\\r\\nVolkswagen AG shares are primarily traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange,[82] and are listed under the 'VOW' and 'VOW3' stock ticker symbols. First listed in August 1961, the shares were issued at a price of DM?350 per DM?100 share,[82] Volkswagen AG shares are now separated into two different types or classes: 'ordinary shares' and 'preference shares'.[82] The ordinary shares are now traded under the WKN?766400 and ISIN DE0007664005 listings, and the preference shares under the WKN?766403 and ISIN DE0007664039 listings.[82]\\r\\nVolkswagen AG shares are also listed and traded on other major domestic and worldwide stock exchanges. In Germany's domestic exchanges, since 1961 these include those in Berlin, Dsseldorf, Hamburg, Hanover, Munich and Stuttgart. International exchanges include those in Basel (listed in 1967), Geneva (1967), Zrich (1967), Luxembourg (1979), London (1988), and New York (1988).[82]\\r\\nSince the start of trading in 1961, Volkswagen AG shares have been subjected to two stock splits?ÿ the first was on 17 March 1969 when they were split at a ratio of 2:1, from a DM?100 share to a DM?50 share.

With an outcome before the start of the Tour unlikely, the ASO attempted to bar Froome from starting the race, citing article 28 of the race's rules, saying that the organiser \\"expressly reserves the right to refuse participation inor to exclude fromthe event, a team or any of its members whose presence would be such as to damage the image or reputation of ASO or the event\\".[16] Froome was cleared by the UCI on 2 July 2018, with a press statement reading that the authorities had found sufficient evidence \\"that Mr Froomes sample results do not constitute an AAF\\".[17] He was thereafter cleared to start the Tour by the ASO as well.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe closest rivals of Froome were thought to be Richie Porte (BMC Racing Team), Nairo Quintana, Mikel Landa (both of Movistar Team), Tom Dumoulin (Team Sunweb), and Vincenzo Nibali (BahrainÿMerida).[19] The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Geraint Thomas (Team Sky), Romain Bardet (AG2R La Mondiale), Primo? Rogli? (LottoNLÿJumbo), Adam Yates (MitcheltonÿBikeExchange), Jakob Fuglsang (Astana), Alejandro Valverde (Movistar Team), Rigoberto Urn (EF Education FirstÿDrapac p/b Cannondale), Dan Martin (UAE Team Emirates), Bob Jungels (Quick-Step Floors) and Ilnur Zakarin (Team KatushaÿAlpecin).[13][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (BoraÿHansgrohe), Fernando Gaviria (Quick-Step Floors), Dylan Groenewegen (LottoNLÿJumbo), Arnaud Dmare (GroupamaÿFDJ), Marcel Kittel (Team KatushaÿAlpecin), Michael Matthews (Team Sunweb), Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data), Andr Greipel (LottoÿSoudal), Alexander Kristoff (UAE Team Emirates), Sonny Colbrelli (BahrainÿMerida) and John Degenkolb (TrekÿSegafredo).[29][30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 February 2017 at a rugby union match between France and Scotland at the Stade de France, the Tour's race director Christian Prudhomme announced the start of the 2018 Tour (known as the Grand Dpart) would be in the Vende department, in the Pays de la Loire region. The departments in the Pays de la Loire region hosted the Tour de France in its first edition back in 1903. Since then, the cities and towns of the Pays de la Loire region have welcomed the Grand Dpart of the Tour de France nine times, five of which have set out from the Vende. The last time the region hosted the Tour was in 2011.[32] Two weeks after the announcement, the ASO revealed that the Grand Dpart would take place over three stages, with the third a team time trial.[33] In June 2017, the UCIs Professional Cycling Council (PCC) moved the start of the Tour a week later than usual and originally planned due to a clash with the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[1] The full route was announced on 17 October 2017; it was almost completely within France, with short deviations into Spain in the Pyrenees were the only exceptions. It would feature two of the Tour's most historic climbs, Alpe d'Huez and the Col de Tourmalet, which last featured in 2015 and 2016 respectively. For the first time in 60 to 70 years, it included a section of unpaved roads on the Glires Plateau.[34] Of the route, Mark Cavendish labelled it \\"absolutely brutal\\".[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of 3,351?km (2,082?mi), the shortest of the 21st century.[36][37] The race also included 21.7?km (13.5?mi) of cobblestones (or pavs) in stage 9, which were last featured in 2015. In the first week of the race, two laps of the short, but steep, M?r-de-Bretagne were included.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage one's bunch sprint was won by Tour debutant Fernando Gaviria, with Peter Sagan coming in second and Marcel Kittel in third. Gaviria took the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of the general and points classifications respectively. Kvin Ledanois (FortuneoÿSamsic) took the first polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification.[38] Sagan won stage two from a sprint to take the yellow and green jerseys, with Dion Smith of WantyÿGroupe Gobert claiming the polka.[39] Stage three's team time trial was won by BMC Racing Team whose riders Tejay van Garderen and Greg Van Avermaet became tied for the overall lead,[40] with Van Avermaet moving into yellow for the second time in his career due to him crossing the finish line ahead of Van Garderen in the first two stages being as there was not yet an individual time trial to measure their times down to the 1000th of a second.[41] Stage four was won by Gaviria from a bunch sprint.[42][43] Sagan further extend his lead in the points competition by winning stage five. Also in stage five, Toms Skuji?? of TrekÿSegafredo won the mountains points which gave him the polka. Skujins became the first rider from Latvia to ever lead the mountains classification.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage six was a sprint that Sagan and John Degenkolb raced for, seeing as virtually all of the top sprinters finished close to fifteen minutes behind the general classification contenders. Team Sky, BMC Racing Team, and Movistar Team controlled the peloton, where Geraint Thomas reeled in the final breakaway rider and won the three second time bonus sprint that put him back only three seconds behind Van Avermaet in the general classification. With only about a kilometre to go Dan Martin attacked and was able to stay away and win the stage one second ahead of the bulk of the general classification contenders. Romain Bardet and Tom Dumoulin suffered mechanical issues late in the stage which made them lose time.[45][46] Stage seven was the longest stage. At the start of stage seven, Van Avermaet remained in the yellow jersey with Thomas in second at three seconds behind. The stage was won by Dylan Groenewegen. There were multiple crashes in the first week of the tour and after stage seven, six riders had abandoned the race for various reasons including the promising young Belgian Tiesj Benoot (LottoÿSoudal), Luis Le܇n Snchez (Astana),[47] and the green jersey winner of the 2017 Tour Michael Matthews.[48] This marked the end of the first week of the tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroenewegen then won his second sprint stage in a row. Notably, Greipel and Gaviria were penalized for headbutting each other and lost their placing and green jersey points.[49] Martin lost more than a minute after being involved in a crash during the stage. Van Avermaet improved his lead in the general classification after earning a single second in the bonus sprint.[50] Stage nine was the cobblestone stage that was a bad day for numerous sprinters and general classification riders. Richie Porte abandoned after a crash for the second year in a row.[51] Egan Bernal, Jakob Fuglsang, Chris Froome, and Mikel Landa crashed as did many other riders; many riders had flat tires as well, including Bardet who got three of them.[52] Meanwhile, Yves Lampaert (Quick-Step Floors), Degenkolb, and Van Avermaet survived the carnage going on around them to escape the remaining peloton and cross the finish together with Degenkolb winning his first Tour stage, as Van Avermaet gained time as well as another time bonus to extend his lead in the yellow jersey.[53] The following day was the Tour's first rest day.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first stage at high altitude and first in the Alps, the tenth, was won by Quick-Step Floors rider Julian Alaphilippe from a large breakaway that included race leader Van Avermaet. Eventually, Alaphillipe attacked and won his first Tour stage while Van Avermaet retained his yellow jersey and extended his lead to nearly two and a half minutes,[54] when many people thought he would not be retaining it.[55] Alaphillipe also took the mountains classification.[54] Thomas achieved back-to-back summit finish wins both from the group of favourites on stages eleven and twelve by pushing the breakaway riders until the very end. In the steep finish of the eleventh, Thomas attacked in the final kilometre and passed lone breakaway rider Mikel Nieve (MitcheltonÿScott) to take the win.[56] He won stage twelve from a sprint on flat finish atop Alpe d'Huez. Dumoulin and Froome arose as the likely contenders in Paris.[57] Sagan won stage thirteen after coming out of nowhere while Kristoff and Arnaud Dmare (GroupamaÿFDJ) dueled it out.[58] In stage fourteen, Omar Fraile of Astana came out of the breakaway and remarkably opened a twenty-minute gap to the main peloton with the yellow jersey contenders. After the Alps, it was basically down to three riders in contention, Thomas, Froome, and Dumoulin. There were many withdrawals after the Alps after names like Kittel, Mark Cavendish, Rigoberto Uran, Gaviria, Groenewegen, and Andre Griepel withdrew for various reasons. Vincenzo Nibali was forced to withdraw after fracturing a vertebrae in his back after being involved in an accident with a spectator near the summit of Alpe d'huez. Smoke from flares and animosity towards Froome were a factor and better security was called for by many people for the final week.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nStage fifteen, the start of the final week, was once again a breakaway victory. Magnus Cort took Astana's second win in two days as there were no major changes overall.[60] The next day was the second rest day of the race.[36] Stage sixteen had a further incident when the police used tear gas against a protest by local farmers who had placed hay bales on the road. As the riders passed that point, there was still gas in the air. The race was neutralized for about fifteen minutes because several riders had problems with their eyes and had to rinse them.[61] After the restart, a large breakaway escaped and Philippe Gilbert (Quick-Step Floors), while in the lead on a descent, lost control of his bike and smashed into and over the wall. Later, Adam Yates, having taken the lead, fell on the final descent and handed the position and win to Alaphilippe, giving him his second stage win of the tour.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the first of the three Pyrenan stages, seventeen, Froome's challenge faded on the approach to the summit of the Col de Portet and he dropped to third position in the general classification, 2:31 behind Thomas. Dumoulin moved into second place, 1:59 off the lead. Nairo Quintana won the stage after attacking at the bottom of the final climb, moving himself up to fifth overall, behind Primo? Rogli?.[63] The flat stage eighteen was won by Demare from a sprint finish; by now most of the top sprint had now left the race and Sagan was suffering with injury.[64] On the mountainous stage nineteen from Lourdes to Laruns, Rogli? attacked on the final climb, the Col d'Aubisque, and soloed to the finish nineteen seconds ahead of the chasing group of overall favourites. Thomas was able to consolidate his position in the yellow jersey by picking up six bonus seconds in the sprint thereby extending his lead over Dumoulin to 2 min 5 s.[65] The penultimate stage was a 31?km (19.3?mi) time trial, Dumoulin won the stage, one second ahead of Froome. Thomas survived a scare when his back wheel locked, but completed the time trial successfully, finishing fourteen seconds behind Dumoulin taking a lead of 1 min 51 s into the final stage.[66] The stage was won by Kristoff in a bunch sprint on the Champs-lyses in Paris.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nFour main individual classifications were contested in the 2018 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.[68] Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders would get 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. Time bonuses of three, two and one seconds, would be given to the first three riders to cross a \\"bonus point\\" in each of the first nine mass-start stages of the race. It would affect the general classification, but not the points.[69] For crashes within the final 3?km (1.9?mi) of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved would receive the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred.[70] The rider with the lowest cumulative time would be the winner of the general classification and the overall winner of the Tour.[68] The rider leading the classification would wear a yellow jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.[72] The leader was identified by a green jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and hors catgorie (read: \\"beyond category\\").[72] Double points were awarded at the top of the last mountains in the three mountain stages in the Pyrenees (16, 17 and 19).[73] The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but was restricted to riders born on or after 1 January 1993.[72] The leader wears a white jersey.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.[72] The riders in the team that lead this classification are identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \\"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\\".[69] No combativity awards are given for the time trials and the final stage.[75] The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.[76] At the conclusion of the Tour, a rider would win the overall super-combativity award which was, again, awarded by a jury.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of ?2,287,750 was awarded in cash prizes in the race.[75] The overall winner of the general classification received ?500,000, with the second and third placed riders getting ?200,000 and ?100,000 respectively.[77] All finishers in the top 160 were awarded money.[77] The holders of the classifications would benefit on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains would be given ?25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider would get ?20,000.[78] The team classification winners was given ?50,000.[79] ?11,000 was given to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2ÿ20.[77] There were also two special awards each with a prize of ?5000.[75] The Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col du Portet on stage seventeen,[80] and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage nineteen.[75] Nairo Quintana won the Henri Desgrange and Julian Alaphilippe won the Jacques Goddet.[81][82]","input":"Where did le tour de france start 2018?"},{"output":"April 1946","context":"\\"Politics and the English Language\\" (1946) is an essay by George Orwell that criticises the \\"ugly and inaccurate\\" written English of his time and examines the connection between political orthodoxies and the debasement of language.\\r\\nThe essay focuses on political language, which, according to Orwell, \\"is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\\" Orwell believed that the language used was necessarily vague or meaningless because it was intended to hide the truth rather than express it. This unclear prose was a \\"contagion\\" which had spread to those who did not intend to hide the truth, and it concealed a writer's thoughts from himself and others.[1] Orwell encourages concreteness and clarity instead of vagueness, and individuality over political conformity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrwell relates what he believes to be a close association between bad prose and oppressive ideology:\\r\\nIn our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them.\\r\\nOne of Orwell's points is:\\r\\nThe great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.\\r\\nThe insincerity of the writer perpetuates the decline of the language as people (particularly politicians, Orwell later notes) attempt to disguise their intentions behind euphemisms and convoluted phrasing. Orwell says that this decline is self-perpetuating. He argues that it is easier to think with poor English because the language is in decline, as the language declines, \\"foolish\\" thoughts become even easier, reinforcing the original cause:\\r\\nA man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.\\r\\nOrwell discusses \\"pretentious diction\\" and \\"meaningless words\\". \\"Pretentious diction\\" is used to make biases look impartial and scientific, while \\"meaningless words\\" are used to stop the reader from seeing the point of the statement. According to Orwell: \\"In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.\\"\\r\\nOrwell chooses five passages of text which \\"illustrate various of the mental vices from which we now suffer.\\" The samples are: by Harold Laski (\\"five negatives in 53 words\\"), Lancelot Hogben (mixed metaphors), an essay by Paul Goodman[2] on psychology in the July 1945 issue of politics (\\"simply meaningless\\"), a communist pamphlet (\\"an accumulation of stale phrases\\") and a reader's letter in Tribune (in which \\"words and meaning have parted company\\"). From these, Orwell identifies a \\"catalogue of swindles and perversions\\" which he classifies as \\"dying metaphors\\", \\"operators or verbal false limbs\\", \\"pretentious diction\\" and \\"meaningless words\\". (see cliches, prolixity, peacock terms and weasel words).\\r\\nOrwell notes that writers of modern prose tend not to write in concrete terms but use a \\"pretentious latinized style\\" (compare Anglish). He claims writers find it is easier to gum together long strings of words than to pick words specifically for their meaning, particularly in political writing, where Orwell notes that \\"[o]rthodoxy ... seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style.\\" Political speech and writing are generally in defence of the indefensible and so lead to a euphemistic inflated style.\\r\\nOrwell criticises bad writing habits which spread by imitation. He argues that writers must think more clearly because thinking clearly \\"is a necessary first step toward political regeneration\\". He later emphasises that he was not \\"considering the literary use of language, but merely language as an instrument for expressing and not for concealing or preventing thought.\\"\\r\\nAs a further example, Orwell \\"translates\\" Ecclesiastes 9:11:\\r\\nI returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\\r\\n into \\"modern English of the worst sort\\":\\r\\nObjective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\\r\\nOrwell points out that this \\"translation\\" contains many more syllables but gives no concrete illustrations, as the original did, nor does it contain any vivid, arresting images or phrases.\\r\\nThe headmaster's wife at St Cyprian's School, Mrs. Cicely Vaughan Wilkes (nicknamed \\"Flip\\"), taught English to Orwell and used the same method to illustrate good writing to her pupils. She would use simple passages from the King James Bible and then \\"translate\\" them into poor English to show the clarity and brilliance of the original.[3] Walter John Christie, who followed Orwell to Eton College, wrote that she preached the virtues of \\"simplicity, honesty, and avoidance of verbiage\\",[4] and pointed out that the qualities Flip most prized were later to be seen in Orwell's writing.[5]\\r\\nOrwell said it was easy for his contemporaries to slip into bad writing of the sort he had described and that the temptation to use meaningless or hackneyed phrases was like a \\"packet of aspirins always at one's elbow\\". In particular, such phrases are always ready to form the writer's thoughts for him to save him the bother of thinking, or writing, clearly. However, he concluded that the progressive decline of the English language was reversible,[6] and suggested six rules which, he claimed, would prevent many of these faults although, \\"one could keep all of them and still write bad English\\".\\r\\n\\"Politics and the English Language\\" was first noted in Orwell's payment book of 11 December 1945.[7] The essay was originally published in the April 1946 issue of the journal Horizon (volume 13, issue 76, pages 252ÿ265);[8] it was Orwell's last major article for the journal.[9] The essay was originally intended for George Weidenfeld's Contact magazine but it was turned down.\\r\\nFrom the time of his wife's death in March 1945 Orwell had maintained a high work rate, producing some 130 literary contributions, many of them lengthy. Animal Farm had been published in August 1945 and Orwell was experiencing a time of critical and commercial literary success. He was seriously ill in February and was desperate to get away from London to the island of Jura, Scotland, where he wanted to start work on Nineteen Eighty-Four.[8]\\r\\n\\"Politics and the English Language\\" was published nearly simultaneously with another of Orwell's essays, \\"The Prevention of Literature\\". Both reflect Orwell's concern with truth and how truth depends upon the use of language. Orwell noted the deliberate use of misleading language to hide unpleasant political and military facts and also identified a laxity of language among those he identified as pro-soviet. In The Prevention of Literature he also speculated on the type of literature under a future totalitarian society which he predicted would be formulaic and low grade sensationalism. Around the same time Orwell wrote an unsigned editorial for Polemic in response to an attack from \\"Modern Quarterly\\". In this he highlights the double-talk and appalling prose of J. D. Bernal in the same magazine, and cites Edmund Wilson's damnation of the prose of Joseph E. Davies in Mission to Moscow.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn his biography of Orwell, Michael Shelden called the article \\"his most important essay on style\\",[10] while Bernard Crick made no reference to the work at all in his original biography, reserving his praise for Orwell's essays in Polemic, which cover a similar political theme.[11] John Rodden asserts, given that much of Orwell's work was polemical, that he sometimes violated these rules and Orwell himself concedes that if you look back through his essay, \\"for certain you will find that I have again and again committed the very faults I am protesting against\\",[12] Rodden also says that Terry Eagleton had praised the essay's demystification of political language but later became disenchanted with Orwell.[13]\\r\\nLinguist Geoffrey Pullumdespite being an admirer of Orwell's writingcriticised the essay for \\"its insane and unfollowable insistence that good writing must avoid all phrases and word uses that are familiar.\\" [14] Orwell's admonition to avoid using the passive voice has also been criticised, Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage refers to three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals, stating: \\"the highest incidence of passive constructions was 13 percent. Orwell runs to a little over 20 percent in \\"Politics and the English Language\\". Clearly he found the construction useful in spite of his advice to avoid it as much as possible\\".[15]\\r\\nIntroductory writing courses frequently cite this essay.[16] A 1999 study found that the essay was reprinted 118 times in 325 editions of 58 readers published between 1946 and 1996 that were intended for use in college-level composition courses.[17]\\r\\nAn article from 1981, Carl Freedman's Writing Ideology, and Politics: Orwell's 'Politics and the English Language' and English Composition, set in motion a \\"wide variety of critiques, reconsiderations, and outright attacks against the plain style\\"[18] that is argued for in Orwell's essay. The main issue that most critics[weasel?words] found with Orwell's argument for simple language is \\"his simplistic faith about thought and language existing in a dialectical relation with one another; others quickly cut to the chase by insisting that politics, rightly considered, meant the insertion of an undercutting whose before every value word the hegemony holds dear.\\"[19] These critics also began to question Orwell for his argument of the absoluteness of the English language, and really question whose values and truths were being represented through the language. While there are many scholars who defend Orwell's arguments in \\"Politics and the English Language\\", there are also those who see many issues with the essay. In Kogan's \\"In Celebration of George Orwell on the Fiftieth Anniversary of 'Politics and the English Language'\\" issues arising from Orwell's arguments are discussed.\\r\\nOrwell's writings on the English language have had a large impact on classrooms, journalism, and other writing. In Trail's \\"Teaching Argument and the Rhetoric of Orwell's 'Politics and the English Language'\\" it is said that \\"A large part of Orwell's rhetorical approach consists of attempting at every opportunity to acquire reader participation, to involve the reader as an active and engaged consumer of the essay. Popular journalism is full of what may be the inheritance of Orwell's reader involvement devices\\".[20] Haltom and Ostrom's work, Teaching George Orwell in Karl Rove's World: 'Politics and the English Language' in the 21st Century Classroom, discusses how following of Orwell's six rules of English writing and speaking can have a place in the high school and university setting.[21]\\r\\nOrwell's preoccupation with language as a theme can be seen in protagonist Gordon Comstock's dislike of advertising slogans in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, an early work of his. This preoccupation is also visible in Homage to Catalonia, and continued as an underlying theme of Orwell's work for the years after World War II.[22]\\r\\nThe themes in \\"Politics and the English Language\\" anticipate Orwell's development of Newspeak in Nineteen Eighty-Four.[8] One analyst, Michael Shelden, calls Newspeak \\"the perfect language for a society of bad writers ... because it reduces the number of choices available to them.\\"[10] Shelden says that Newspeak first corrupts writers morally, then politically, \\"since it allows writers to cheat themselves and their readers with ready-made prose.\\"[10]","input":"When was politics and the english language published?"},{"output":"as early as 1996","context":"Cloud computing is an information technology (IT) paradigm that enables ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort, often over the Internet. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a public utility.\\r\\nThird-party clouds enable organizations to focus on their core businesses instead of expending resources on computer infrastructure and maintenance.[1] Advocates note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand.[1][2][3] Cloud providers typically use a \\"pay-as-you-go\\" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.[4]\\r\\nSince the launch of Amazon EC2 in 2006, the availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing.[5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the term \\"cloud computing\\" was popularized with Amazon.com releasing its Elastic Compute Cloud product in 2006,[8] references to the phrase \\"cloud computing\\" appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.[9]\\r\\nThe cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as early as 1977,[10] and the CSNET by 1981[11]  both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word cloud was used as a metaphor for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a network on telephony schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the end points of a network are connected are not relevant for the purposes of understanding the diagram.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.[12] In Wired's April 1994 feature \\"Bill and Andy's Excellent Adventure II\\", Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic's distributed programming language:\\r\\n\\"The beauty of Telescript?... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create sort of a virtual service. No one had conceived that before. The example Jim White [the designer of Telescript, X.400 and ASN.1] uses now is a date-arranging service where a software agent goes to the flower store and orders flowers and then goes to the ticket shop and gets the tickets for the show, and everything is communicated to both parties.\\"[13]\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE (Remote Job Entry);[14] this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as IBM and DEC. Full-time-sharing solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS, and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the \\"data center\\" model where users submitted jobs to operators to run on IBM mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a lower cost. By switching traffic as they saw fit to balance server use, they could use overall network bandwidth more effectively.[citation needed] They began to use the cloud symbol to denote the demarcation point between what the provider was responsible for and what users were responsible for. Cloud computing extended this boundary to cover all servers as well as the network infrastructure.[15] As computers became more diffused, scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time-sharing.[citation needed] They experimented with algorithms to optimize the infrastructure, platform, and applications to prioritize CPUs and increase efficiency for end users.[16]\\r\\nSince 2000, cloud computing has come into existence.\\r\\nIn August 2006, Amazon introduced its Elastic Compute Cloud.[8]\\r\\nIn April 2008, Google released Google App Engine in beta.[17]\\r\\nIn early 2008, NASA's OpenNebula, enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project, became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds, and for the federation of clouds.[18]\\r\\nBy mid-2008, Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing \\"to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services, those who use IT services and those who sell them\\"[19] and observed that \\"organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models\\" so that the \\"projected shift to computing?... will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other areas.\\"[20]\\r\\nIn February 2010, Microsoft released Microsoft Azure, which was announced in October 2008.[21]\\r\\nIn July 2010, Rackspace Hosting and NASA jointly launched an open-source cloud-software initiative known as OpenStack. The OpenStack project intended to help organizations offering cloud-computing services running on standard hardware. The early code came from NASA's Nebula platform as well as from Rackspace's Cloud Files platform. As an open source offering and along with other open-source solutions such as CloudStack, Ganeti and OpenNebula, it has attracted attention by several key communities. Several studies aim at comparing these open sources offerings based on a set of criteria.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nOn March 1, 2011, IBM announced the IBM SmartCloud framework to support Smarter Planet.[29] Among the various components of the Smarter Computing foundation, cloud computing is a critical part. On June 7, 2012, Oracle announced the Oracle Cloud.[30] This cloud offering is poised to be the first to provide users with access to an integrated set of IT solutions, including the Applications (SaaS), Platform (PaaS), and Infrastructure (IaaS) layers.[31][32][33]\\r\\nIn May 2012, Google Compute Engine was released in preview, before being rolled out into General Availability in December 2013.[34]\\r\\nThe goal of cloud computing is to allow users to take benefit from all of these technologies, without the need for deep knowledge about or expertise with each one of them. The cloud aims to cut costs, and helps the users focus on their core business instead of being impeded by IT obstacles.[35] The main enabling technology for cloud computing is virtualization. Virtualization software separates a physical computing device into one or more \\"virtual\\" devices, each of which can be easily used and managed to perform computing tasks. With operating systemÿlevel virtualization essentially creating a scalable system of multiple independent computing devices, idle computing resources can be allocated and used more efficiently. Virtualization provides the agility required to speed up IT operations, and reduces cost by increasing infrastructure utilization. Autonomic computing automates the process through which the user can provision resources on-demand. By minimizing user involvement, automation speeds up the process, reduces labor costs and reduces the possibility of human errors.[35]\\r\\nUsers routinely face difficult business problems. Cloud computing adopts concepts from Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) that can help the user break these problems into services that can be integrated to provide a solution. Cloud computing provides all of its resources as services, and makes use of the well-established standards and best practices gained in the domain of SOA to allow global and easy access to cloud services in a standardized way.\\r\\nCloud computing also leverages concepts from utility computing to provide metrics for the services used. Such metrics are at the core of the public cloud pay-per-use models. In addition, measured services are an essential part of the feedback loop in autonomic computing, allowing services to scale on-demand and to perform automatic failure recovery. Cloud computing is a kind of grid computing; it has evolved by addressing the QoS (quality of service) and reliability problems. Cloud computing provides the tools and technologies to build data/compute intensive parallel applications with much more affordable prices compared to traditional parallel computing techniques.[35]\\r\\nCloud computing shares characteristics with:\\r\\nCloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:\\r\\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology's definition of cloud computing identifies \\"five essential characteristics\\":\\r\\nOn-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\\r\\nBroad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\\r\\nResource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand.?\\r\\nRapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\\r\\nThough service-oriented architecture advocates \\"everything as a service\\" (with the acronyms EaaS or XaaS,[57] or simply aas), cloud-computing providers offer their \\"services\\" according to different models, of which the three standard models per NIST are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).[56] These models offer increasing abstraction; they are thus often portrayed as a layers in a stack: infrastructure-, platform- and software-as-a-service, but these need not be related. For example, one can provide SaaS implemented on physical machines (bare metal), without using underlying PaaS or IaaS layers, and conversely one can run a program on IaaS and access it directly, without wrapping it as SaaS.\\r\\n\\"Infrastructure as a service\\" (IaaS) refers to online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements. Linux containers run in isolated partitions of a single Linux kernel running directly on the physical hardware. Linux cgroups and namespaces are the underlying Linux kernel technologies used to isolate, secure and manage the containers. Containerisation offers higher performance than virtualization, because there is no hypervisor overhead. Also, container capacity auto-scales dynamically with computing load, which eliminates the problem of over-provisioning and enables usage-based billing.[58] IaaS clouds often offer additional resources such as a virtual-machine disk-image library, raw block storage, file or object storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks (VLANs), and software bundles.[59]\\r\\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing describes IaaS as \\"where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).\\"[56]\\r\\nIaaS-cloud providers supply these resources on-demand from their large pools of equipment installed in data centers. For wide-area connectivity, customers can use either the Internet or carrier clouds (dedicated virtual private networks). To deploy their applications, cloud users install operating-system images and their application software on the cloud infrastructure.[60][unreliable source?] In this model, the cloud user patches and maintains the operating systems and the application software. Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis: cost reflects the amount of resources allocated and consumed.[61][62][63][64]\\r\\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Platform as a Service as:[56]\\r\\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.\\r\\nPaaS vendors offer a development environment to application developers. The provider typically develops toolkit and standards for development and channels for distribution and payment. In the PaaS models, cloud providers deliver a computing platform, typically including operating system, programming-language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers. With some PaaS offers like Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Platform and Google App Engine, the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand so that the cloud user does not have to allocate resources manually. The latter has also been proposed by an architecture aiming to facilitate real-time in cloud environments.[65][need quotation to verify] Even more specific application types can be provided via PaaS, such as media encoding as provided by services like bitcodin.com[66] or media.io.[67]\\r\\nSome integration and data management providers have also embraced specialized applications of PaaS as delivery models for data solutions. Examples include iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) and dPaaS (Data Platform as a Service). iPaaS enables customers to develop, execute and govern integration flows.[68] Under the iPaaS integration model, customers drive the development and deployment of integrations without installing or managing any hardware or middleware.[69] dPaaS delivers integrationand data-managementproducts as a fully managed service.[70] Under the dPaaS model, the PaaS provider, not the customer, manages the development and execution of data solutions by building tailored data applications for the customer. dPaaS users retain transparency and control over data through data-visualization tools.[71] Platform as a Service (PaaS) consumers do not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but have control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.\\r\\nA recent specialized PaaS is the Blockchain as a Service (BaaS), that some vendors such as IBM Bluemix and Oracle Cloud Platform have already included in their PaaS offering.[72][73]\\r\\nThe NIST's definition of cloud computing defines Software as a Service as:[56]\\r\\nThe capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.\\r\\nIn the software as a service (SaaS) model, users gain access to application software and databases. Cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. SaaS is sometimes referred to as \\"on-demand software\\" and is usually priced on a pay-per-use basis or using a subscription fee.[74] In the SaaS model, cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients. Cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform where the application runs. This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user's own computers, which simplifies maintenance and support. Cloud applications differ from other applications in their scalabilitywhich can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet changing work demand.[75] Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machines. This process is transparent to the cloud user, who sees only a single access-point. To accommodate a large number of cloud users, cloud applications can be multitenant, meaning that any machine may serve more than one cloud-user organization.\\r\\nThe pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user,[76] so prices become scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any point.[77] Proponents claim that SaaS gives a business the potential to reduce IT operational costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the cloud provider. This enables the business to reallocate IT operations costs away from hardware/software spending and from personnel expenses, towards meeting other goals. In addition, with applications hosted centrally, updates can be released without the need for users to install new software. One drawback of SaaS comes with storing the users' data on the cloud provider's server. As a result,[citation needed] there could be unauthorized access to the data.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the mobile \\"backend\\" as a service (m) model, also known as backend as a service (BaaS), web app and mobile app developers are provided with a way to link their applications to cloud storage and cloud computing services with application programming interfaces (APIs) exposed to their applications and custom software development kits (SDKs). Services include user management, push notifications, integration with social networking services[78] and more. This is a relatively recent model in cloud computing,[79] with most BaaS startups dating from 2011 or later[80][81][82] but trends indicate that these services are gaining significant mainstream traction with enterprise consumers.[83]\\r\\nServerless computing is a cloud computing code execution model in which the cloud provider fully manages starting and stopping virtual machines as necessary to serve requests, and requests are billed by an abstract measure of the resources required to satisfy the request, rather than per virtual machine, per hour.[84] Despite the name, it does not actually involve running code without servers.[84] Serverless computing is so named because the business or person that owns the system does not have to purchase, rent or provision servers or virtual machines for the back-end code to run on.\\r\\nPrivate cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization, whether managed internally or by a third-party, and hosted either internally or externally.[56] Undertaking a private cloud project requires significant engagement to virtualize the business environment, and requires the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resources. It can improve business, but every step in the project raises security issues that must be addressed to prevent serious vulnerabilities. Self-run data centers[85] are generally capital intensive. They have a significant physical footprint, requiring allocations of space, hardware, and environmental controls. These assets have to be refreshed periodically, resulting in additional capital expenditures. They have attracted criticism because users \\"still have to buy, build, and manage them\\" and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management,[86] essentially \\"[lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept\\".[87][88]\\r\\nA cloud is called a \\"public cloud\\" when the services are rendered over a network that is open for public use. Public cloud services may be free.[89] Technically there may be little or no difference between public and private cloud architecture, however, security consideration may be substantially different for services (applications, storage, and other resources) that are made available by a service provider for a public audience and when communication is effected over a non-trusted network. Generally, public cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Oracle, Microsoft and Google own and operate the infrastructure at their data center and access is generally via the Internet. AWS, Oracle, Microsoft, and Google also offer direct connect services called \\"AWS Direct Connect\\", \\"Oracle FastConnect\\", \\"Azure ExpressRoute\\", and \\"Cloud Interconnect\\" respectively, such connections require customers to purchase or lease a private connection to a peering point offered by the cloud provider.[40][90]\\r\\nHybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community or public) that remain distinct entities but are bound together, offering the benefits of multiple deployment models. Hybrid cloud can also mean the ability to connect collocation, managed and/or dedicated services with cloud resources.[56] Gartner defines a hybrid cloud service as a cloud computing service that is composed of some combination of private, public and community cloud services, from different service providers.[91] A hybrid cloud service crosses isolation and provider boundaries so that it can't be simply put in one category of private, public, or community cloud service. It allows one to extend either the capacity or the capability of a cloud service, by aggregation, integration or customization with another cloud service.\\r\\nVaried use cases for hybrid cloud composition exist. For example, an organization may store sensitive client data in house on a private cloud application, but interconnect that application to a business intelligence application provided on a public cloud as a software service.[92] This example of hybrid cloud extends the capabilities of the enterprise to deliver a specific business service through the addition of externally available public cloud services. Hybrid cloud adoption depends on a number of factors such as data security and compliance requirements, level of control needed over data, and the applications an organization uses.[93]\\r\\nAnother example of hybrid cloud is one where IT organizations use public cloud computing resources to meet temporary capacity needs that can not be met by the private cloud.[94] This capability enables hybrid clouds to employ cloud bursting for scaling across clouds.[56] Cloud bursting is an application deployment model in which an application runs in a private cloud or data center and \\"bursts\\" to a public cloud when the demand for computing capacity increases. A primary advantage of cloud bursting and a hybrid cloud model is that an organization pays for extra compute resources only when they are needed.[95] Cloud bursting enables data centers to create an in-house IT infrastructure that supports average workloads, and use cloud resources from public or private clouds, during spikes in processing demands.[96] The specialized model of hybrid cloud, which is built atop heterogeneous hardware, is called \\"Cross-platform Hybrid Cloud\\". A cross-platform hybrid cloud is usually powered by different CPU architectures, for example, x86-64 and ARM, underneath. Users can transparently deploy and scale applications without knowledge of the cloud's hardware diversity.[97] This kind of cloud emerges from the raise of ARM-based system-on-chip for server-class computing.\\r\\nCommunity cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns (security, compliance, jurisdiction, etc.), whether managed internally or by a third-party, and either hosted internally or externally. The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud (but more than a private cloud), so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realized.[56]\\r\\nA cloud computing platform can be assembled from a distributed set of machines in different locations, connected to a single network or hub service. It is possible to distinguish between two types of distributed clouds: public-resource computing and volunteer cloud.\\r\\nMulticloud is the use of multiple cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture to reduce reliance on single vendors, increase flexibility through choice, mitigate against disasters, etc. It differs from hybrid cloud in that it refers to multiple cloud services, rather than multiple deployment modes (public, private, legacy).[99][100][101]\\r\\nThe issues of transferring large amounts of data to the cloud as well as data security once the data is in the cloud initially hampered adoption of cloud for big data, but now that much data originates in the cloud and with the advent of bare-metal servers, the cloud has become[102] a solution for use cases including business analytics and geospatial analysis.[103] Solutions range from Hadoop hosting in the cloud to end-to-end analytics.[104]\\r\\nHPC cloud refers to the use of cloud computing services and infrastructure to execute high-performance computing (HPC) applications [105]. These applications consume considerable amount of computing power and memory and are traditionally executed on clusters of computers. Various vendors offer servers that can support the execution of these applications [106] [107] [108] [109]. In HPC cloud, the deployment model allows all HPC resources to be inside the cloud provider infrastructure or different portions of HPC resources to be shared between cloud provider and client on-premise infrastructure. The adoption of cloud to run HPC applications started mostly for applications composed of independent tasks with no inter-process communication. As cloud providers began to offer high-speed network technologies such as InfiniBand, multiprocessing tightly coupled applications started to benefit from cloud as well.\\r\\nCloud architecture,[110] the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing, typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queue. Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling as applied to mechanisms such as these and others.\\r\\nCloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization, and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems. It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems, software, web, performance, information, security, platform, risk, and quality engineering.\\r\\nCloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider can access the data that is in the cloud at any time. It could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete information.[111] Many cloud providers can share information with third parties if necessary for purposes of law and order even without a warrant. That is permitted in their privacy policies, which users must agree to before they start using cloud services. Solutions to privacy include policy and legislation as well as end users' choices for how data is stored.[111] Users can encrypt data that is processed or stored within the cloud to prevent unauthorized access.[112][111]\\r\\nAccording to the Cloud Security Alliance, the top three threats in the cloud are Insecure Interfaces and API's, Data Loss & Leakage, and Hardware Failurewhich accounted for 29%, 25% and 10% of all cloud security outages respectively. Together, these form shared technology vulnerabilities. In a cloud provider platform being shared by different users there may be a possibility that information belonging to different customers resides on same data server. Additionally, Eugene Schultz, chief technology officer at Emagined Security, said that hackers are spending substantial time and effort looking for ways to penetrate the cloud. \\"There are some real Achilles' heels in the cloud infrastructure that are making big holes for the bad guys to get into\\". Because data from hundreds or thousands of companies can be stored on large cloud servers, hackers can theoretically gain control of huge stores of information through a single attacka process he called \\"hyperjacking\\". Some examples of this include the Dropbox security breach, and iCloud 2014 leak.[113] Dropbox had been breached in October 2014, having over 7 million of its users passwords stolen by hackers in an effort to get monetary value from it by Bitcoins (BTC). By having these passwords, they are able to read private data as well as have this data be indexed by search engines (making the information public).[113]\\r\\nThere is the problem of legal ownership of the data (If a user stores some data in the cloud, can the cloud provider profit from it?). Many Terms of Service agreements are silent on the question of ownership.[114] Physical control of the computer equipment (private cloud) is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone else's control (public cloud). This delivers great incentive to public cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure services.[115] Some small businesses that don't have expertise in IT security could find that it's more secure for them to use a public cloud. There is the risk that end users do not understand the issues involved when signing on to a cloud service (persons sometimes don't read the many pages of the terms of service agreement, and just click \\"Accept\\" without reading). This is important now that cloud computing is becoming popular and required for some services to work, for example for an intelligent personal assistant (Apple's Siri or Google Now). Fundamentally, private cloud is seen as more secure with higher levels of control for the owner, however public cloud is seen to be more flexible and requires less time and money investment from the user.[116]\\r\\nAccording to Bruce Schneier, \\"The downside is that you will have limited customization options. Cloud computing is cheaper because of economics of scale, and  like any outsourced task  you tend to get what you get. A restaurant with a limited menu is cheaper than a personal chef who can cook anything you want. Fewer options at a much cheaper price: it's a feature, not a bug.\\" He also suggests that \\"the cloud provider might not meet your legal needs\\" and that businesses need to weigh the benefits of cloud computing against the risks.[117] In cloud computing, the control of the back end infrastructure is limited to the cloud vendor only. Cloud providers often decide on the management policies, which moderates what the cloud users are able to do with their deployment.[118] Cloud users are also limited to the control and management of their applications, data and services.[119] This includes data caps, which are placed on cloud users by the cloud vendor allocating certain amount of bandwidth for each customer and are often shared among other cloud users.[119]\\r\\nPrivacy and confidentiality are big concerns in some activities. For instance, sworn translators working under the stipulations of an NDA, might face problems regarding sensitive data that are not encrypted.[120]\\r\\nCloud computing is beneficial to many enterprises; it lowers costs and allows them to focus on competence instead of on matters of IT and infrastructure. Nevertheless, cloud computing has proven to have some limitations and disadvantages, especially for smaller business operations, particularly regarding security and downtime. Technical outages are inevitable and occur sometimes when cloud service providers become overwhelmed in the process of serving their clients. This may result to temporary business suspension. Since this technology's systems rely on the internet, an individual cannot be able to access their applications, server or data from the cloud during an outage.\\r\\nCloud computing is still a subject of research.[121] A driving factor in the evolution of cloud computing has been chief technology officers seeking to minimize risk of internal outages and mitigate the complexity of housing network and computing hardware in-house.[122] Major cloud technology companies invest billions of dollars per year in cloud Research and Development. For example, in 2011 Microsoft committed 90 percent of its $9.6?billion R&D budget to its cloud.[123] Research by investment bank Centaur Partners in late 2015 forecasted that SaaS revenue would grow from $13.5?billion in 2011 to $32.8?billion in 2016.[124]","input":"When was the first idea of cloud presented?"},{"output":"royal ceremonies","context":"White tie, also called full evening dress or a dress suit, is the most formal evening dress code in Western high fashion. For men, it consists of a black tailcoat worn over a white starched shirt, marcella waistcoat and the eponymous white bow tie worn around a detachable collar. High-waisted black trousers and patent leather shoes complete the outfit, although decorations can be worn and a top hat and white scarf are acceptable as accessories. Women wear full length evening or ball gown and, optionally, jewellery, tiaras, a small bag and evening gloves.\\r\\nThe dress code's origins can be traced to the end of the 18th century, when high society men began abandoning their breeches, lacy shirts and richly decorated evening coats for more austere tailcoats in dark colours, a look inspired by the country gentleman. Fashionable dandies like Beau Brummell popularised a minimalist style in the Regency era, tending to favour dark blue or black tailcoats, often with trousers instead of breeches, and white shirts, waistcoats and cravats. By the 1840s the minimalist black and white combination had become the standard evening wear for upper class men. Despite the emergence of the dinner jacket (or tuxedo) as a less formal and more comfortable alternative in the 1880s, full evening dress remained the staple. At the turn of the 20th century, white became the only colour of waistcoats and ties worn with full evening dress, contrasting with black ties and waistcoats with the dinner jacket, an ensemble which became known as black tie.\\r\\nFrom the 1920s onward black tie slowly replaced white tie as the default evening wear for important events, so that by the 21st century white tie had become rare. White tie nowadays tends to be reserved for special ceremoniesespecially state dinnersand a very select group of social events such as the Al Smith Memorial Dinner in New York, the Commemoration balls at Oxford University, certain May Balls at Cambridge University, the Christmas ball at Buckingham Palace, dinners of certain American hereditary societies, and very formal weddings. The Vienna Opera Ball and the Nobel Prize ceremony are white tie events, and some European universities retain it as the dress code for doctoral conferment ceremonies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the British etiquette guide Debrett's, the central components of full evening dress for men are a white marcella shirt with a detachable wing collar and single cuffs, fastened with studs and cufflinks; the eponymous white marcella bow tie is worn around the collar, while a low-cut marcella waistcoat is worn over the shirt. Over this is worn a black single-breasted barathea wool or ultrafine herringbone tailcoat with silk peak lapels. The trousers have double-braiding down the outside of both legs, while the correct shoes are patent leather or highly polished black dress shoes. Although a white scarf remains popular in winter, the traditional white gloves, top hats, canes and cloaks are now rare. Women wear a full-length evening dress, with the option of jewellery, a tiara, a pashmina, coat or wrap. Long gloves are not compulsory.[1]\\r\\nThe waistcoat should not be visible below the front of the tailcoat, which necessitates a high waistline and (often) braces for the trousers. As one style writer for GQ magazine summarises \\"The simple rule of thumb is that you should only ever see black and white not black, white and black again\\".[2][3] While Debrett's accepts double cuffs for shirts worn with white tie,[1] some tailors and merchant suggest that single, linked cuffs are the most traditional and formal variation acceptable under the dress code.[4] Decorations may also be worn and, unlike Debrett's, Cambridge University's Varsity student newspaper suggests a top hat, opera cloak and silver-topped cane are acceptable accessories.[5] Some invitations to white-tie events, like the last published edition of the British Lord Chamberlain's Guide to Dress at Court, state that national costume or national dress may be substituted for white tie.[6][7]\\r\\nThroughout the Early Modern period, western European male courtiers and aristocrats donned elaborate clothing at ceremonies and dinners: coats (often richly decorated), frilly and lacy shirts and breeches formed the backbone of their most formal attire. As the 18th century drew to a close, high society began adopting more austere clothing which drew inspiration from the dark hues and simpler designs adopted by country gentlemen.[8] By the end of the 18th century, two forms of tail coat were in common use by upper class men in Britain and continental Europe: the more formal dress coat (cut away horizontally at the front) and the less formal morning coat, which curved back from the front to the tails. From around 1815, a knee-length garment called the frock coat became increasingly popular and was eventually established, along with the morning coat, as smart daywear in Victorian England. The dress coat, meanwhile, became reserved for wear in the evening.[9] The dandy Beau Brummell adopted a minimalistic approach to evening weara white waistcoat, dark blue tailcoat, black pantaloons and striped stockings.[10] Although Brummell felt black an ugly colour for evening dress coats, it was adopted by other dandies, like Charles Baudelaire, and black and white had become the standard colours by the 1840s.[11][12]\\r\\nOver the course of the 19th century, the monotone colour scheme became a codified standard for evening events after 6pm in upper class circles.[8] The styles evolved and evening dress consisted of a black dress coat and trousers, white or black waistcoat, and a bow tie by the 1870s. The dinner jacket (tuxedo) emerged as a less formal and more comfortable alternative to full evening dress in the 1880s and, by the early 20th century, full evening dress meant wearing a white waistcoat and tie with a black tailcoat and trousers, the tuxedo incorporated a black bow tie and waistcoat: white tie had become distinct from black tie.[13] Despite its growing popularity, the dinner jacket remained the reserve of family dinners and gentlemen's clubs during the late Victorian period.[8]\\r\\nBy the turn of the 20th century, full evening dress consisted of a black tailcoat made of heavy fabric weighing 16-18 oz per yard. Its lapels were medium width and the white shirt worn beneath it had a heavily starched, stiff front, fastened with pearl or black studs and either a winged collar or a type called a \\"poke\\", consisting of a high band with a slight curve at the front.[14] After World War I, the dinner jacket became more popular, especially in the US, and informal variations sprung up, like the soft, turn-down collar shirt and later the double-breasted jacket;[15] relaxing social norms in Jazz Age America meant white tie was replaced by black tie as the default evening wear for young men, especially at nightclubs.[8] According to The Delineator, the years after World War I saw white tie \\"almost abandoned\\".[16] But it did still have a place: the American etiquette writer Emily Post stated in 1922 that \\"A gentleman must always be in full dress, tail coat, white waistcoat, white tie and white gloves\\" when at the opera, yet she called the tuxedo \\"essential\\" for any gentleman, writing that \\"It is worn every evening and nearly everywhere, whereas the tail coat is necessary only at balls, formal dinners, and in a box at the opera.\\"[17]\\r\\nIt also continued to evolve. White tie was worn with slim-cut trousers in the early 1920s; by 1926, wide-lapelled tailcoats and double-breasted waistcoats were in vogue.[18] The Duke of Windsor (then Prince of Wales and later Edward VIII) wore a midnight blue tailcoat, trousers and waistcoat in the 1920s and 1930s both to \\"soften\\" the contrast between black and white and allow for photographs to depict the nuances of his tailoring.[19] The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed a resurgence in the dress code's popularity,[16][20] but by 1953, one etiquette writer stressed that \\"The modern trend is to wear 'tails' only for the most formal and ceremonious functions, such as important formal dinners, balls, elaborate evening weddings, and opening night at the opera\\".[21]\\r\\nWhite tie is rarely worn in the early 21st century.[1] When the Costume Institute Gala announced a white tie dress code in 2014, a number of media outlets pointed out the difficulty and expense of obtaining traditional white tie, even for the celebrity guests.[22][23] Nevertheless, it survives as the dress code for royal ceremonies, debutante balls, and a select group of other social events in some countries. The male form has also been adopted for some formal weddings.[1] In Britain, it is worn at some state dinners[24][25] and certain May and commemoration balls at Oxford and Cambridge universities as well as University College Durham and St Andrews.[26][27][28] It was the dress code for the Lord Mayor of London's Mansion House banquet until 1996,[29] although David Cameron has worn white tie to the event as Prime Minister.[30] In the US, white tie is worn at some state dinners, including the one held for Elizabeth II in 2007.[31] The Vienna Opera Ball[32] and the Nobel Prize ceremony in Sweden are white tie events;[33] in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, it is the traditional attire for doctoral conferments and is prescribed at some Swedish and Finnish universities, where it is worn with a doctoral hat.[34][35][36][37][38]\\r\\nPrior to World War II formal style of military dress was generally restricted to the British, British Empire and United States armed forces; although the French, Imperial German, Swedish and other navies had adopted their own versions of mess dress during the late nineteenth century, influenced by the Royal Navy.[39]\\r\\nIn the US Army, evening mess uniform, in either blue or white, is the appropriate military uniform for white-tie occasions.[40][citation needed] The blue mess and white mess uniforms are black-tie equivalents, although the Army Service Uniform with bow tie are accepted, especially for non-commissioned officers and newly commissioned officers. For white-tie occasions, of which there are almost none in the United States outside the national capital region for US Army, an officer must wear a wing-collar shirt with white tie and white vest. For black-tie occasions, officers must wear a turndown collar with black tie and black cummerbund. The only outer coat prescribed for both black- and white-tie events is the army blue cape with branch color lining. It is a faux pas to wear white-tie equivalent evening mess uniform for a black-tie event.[41]\\r\\nCertain clergymen wear, in place of white-tie outfits, a cassock with ferraiolone, which is a light-weight ankle-length cape intended to be worn indoors. The colour and fabric of the ferraiolone is determined by the rank of the cleric and can be scarlet watered silk, purple silk, black silk or black wool. For outerwear the black cape (cappa nigra), also known as a choir cape (cappa choralis), is most traditional. It is a long black woollen cloak fastened with a clasp at the neck and often has a hood. Cardinals and bishops may also wear a black plush hat or, less formally, a biretta. In practice, the cassock and especially the ferraiolone have become much less common and no particular formal attire has appeared to replace them. The most formal alternative is a clerical waistcoat incorporating a Roman collar (a rabat) worn with a collarless French cuff shirt and a black suit, although this is closer to \\"black-tie\\" than white-tie. Historically, clerics in the Church of England would wear a knee-length cassock called an apron, accompanied by a tailcoat with silk facings but no lapels, for a white tie occasion. In modern times this is rarely seen, however if worn the knee-length cassock is now replaced with normal dress trousers.","input":"When do you wear a white bow tie?"},{"output":"60ÿ39","context":"","input":"What was the final senate vote on obamacare?"},{"output":"Comcast","context":"A multiple-system operator (MSO) is an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems.

In other autonomous particular Churches, the discipline applies only to ordination to the episcopate.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief of the Catholic particular Churches that follow this discipline is the Latin Church, but among the Eastern Catholic Churches, at least the Ethiopic Catholic Church applies it also.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this context, \\"celibacy\\" retains its original meaning of \\"unmarried\\". Though even the married may observe continence, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the obligation to be celibate is seen as a consequence of the obligation to observe perfect and perpetual continence for the sake of the Kingdom of heaven.[1] Advocates see clerical celibacy as \\"a special gift of God by which sacred ministers can more easily remain close to Christ with an undivided heart, and can dedicate themselves more freely to the service of God and their neighbour.\\"[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the Catholic Church, East as well as West, a priest may not marry. To become a married priest, one must therefore marry before being ordained.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches, without exception, rule out ordination of married men to the episcopate, and marriage after priestly ordination (clerical marriage).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Church considers the law of clerical celibacy to be not a doctrine, but a discipline. Exceptions are sometimes made, especially in the case of married Protestant clergymen who convert to the Catholic Church, and the discipline could in theory be changed for all ordinations to the priesthood.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheologically, the Church teaches that priesthood is a ministry conformed to the life and work of Jesus Christ. Priests as sacramental ministers act in persona Christi, that is in the person of Christ. Thus the life of the priest conforms, the Church believes, to the chastity of Christ himself. The sacrifice of married life is for the \\"sake of the Kingdom\\" (Luke 18:28ÿ30, Matthew 19:27ÿ30), and to follow the example of Jesus Christ in being \\"married\\" to the Church, viewed by Catholicism and many Christian traditions  as the \\"Bride of Christ\\" (following Ephesians 5:25-33 and Revelation 21:9, together with the spousal imagery at Mark 2:19-20; cf. Matthew 9:14-15).[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) in Salt of the Earth saw this practice as based on Jesus' words in Matthew 19:12: \\"Some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.\\" He linked this celibacy \\"because of the kingdom of heaven\\" with God's choice to confer the Old Testament priesthood on a specific tribe, that of Levi, which unlike the other tribes received no land from God, but which had \\"God himself as its inheritance\\" (Numbers 1:48ÿ53).\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul, within a context of having \\"no command from the Lord\\" (1 Cor 7:25), recommends celibacy, but acknowledges that it is not God's gift to all within the church: \\"For I wish that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am, ... I want you to be without care. He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord ÿ how he may please the Lord. But he who is married cares about the things of the world ÿ how he may please his wife. There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world ÿ how she may please her husband. And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction\\" (1 Corinthians 7:7ÿ8, 7:32ÿ35). Peter Brown and Bart D. Ehrman speculate that for early Christians celibacy had to do with the imminent end of the age (1 Corinthians 7:29-31).[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the earliest years of the church, the clergy were largely married men. C K Barrett points to 1 Cor 9:5 as clearly indicating that \\"apostles, like other Christians, have a right to be (and many of them are) married\\" and the right for their wife to be \\"maintained by the communities in which they [the apostles] are working.\\"[5] However, Paul himself was celibate,[6][7] and there is no consensus that inclusion among the requirements for candidacy to the office of \\"overseer\\" of being \\"the husband of one wife\\"[8] meant that celibate Christians were excluded.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies by some Catholic scholars, such as the Ukrainian Roman Cholij[10] and Christian Cochini,[11] have argued for the theory that, in early Christian practice, married men who became prieststhey were often older men, \\"elders\\"were expected to live in complete continence, refraining permanently from sexual relations with their wives.[12][13] When at a later stage it was clear that not all did refrain, the Western Church limited ordination to unmarried men and required a commitment to lifelong celibacy, while the Eastern Churches relaxed the rule, so that Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches now require their married clergy to abstain from sexual relations only for a limited period before celebrating the Eucharist. The Church in Persia, which in the fifth century became separated from the Church described as Orthodox or Catholic, decided at the end of that century to abolish the rule of continence and allow priests to marry, but recognized that it was abrogating an ancient tradition. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, whose separation, along with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, came slightly later, allows deacons (who are ordained when they are boys) to marry after ordination, but not priests: any future priests who wish to marry must do so before becoming priests. The Armenian Apostolic Church, which also belongs to Oriental Orthodoxy, while technically prohibiting, like the Eastern Orthodox Church, marriage after ordination to the sub-diaconate, has generally let this rule fall into disuse and allows deacons to marry up to the point of their priestly ordination, thus continuing to maintain the traditional exclusion of marriage by those who are priests.[14] This theory would explain why all the ancient Christian Churches of both East and West, with the one exception mentioned, exclude marriage after priestly ordination, and why all reserve the episcopate (seen as a fuller form of priesthood than the presbyterate) for the celibate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Catholic scholars, such as Jesuits Peter Fink and George T. Dennis of Catholic University of America, have argued that we cannot know if priests in early Christianity practised sexual abstinence. Dennis says \\"there is simply no clear evidence of a general tradition or practice, much less of an obligation, of priestly celibacy-continence before the beginning of the fourth century.\\"[15] Fink says that a primary book used to support apostolic origins of priestly celibacy \\"remains a work of interpretation. There are underlying premises that seem to hold firm in this book but which would not stand up so comfortably to historical scrutiny.\\"[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest textual evidence of the forbidding of marriage to clerics and the duty of those already married to abstain from sexual contact with their wives is in the fourth-century decrees of the Council of Elvira and the later Council of Carthage (390). According to some writers, this presumed a previous norm, which was being flouted in practice.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the early Church statements on the topic of sexual continence and celibacy are the Directa and Cum in unum decretals of Pope Siricius (c. 385), which asserted that clerical sexual abstinence was an apostolic practice that must be followed by ministers of the church.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writings of Saint Ambrose (died 397) also show that the requirement that priests, whether married or celibate, should be continent was the established rule. To the married clergy who, \\"in some out-of-the-way places\\", claimed, on the model of the Old Testament priesthood, the right to father children, he recalled that in Old Testament times even lay people were obliged to observe continence on the days leading to a sacrifice, and commented: \\"If such regard was paid in what was only the figure, how much ought it to be shown in the reality!\\"[18] Yet more sternly he wrote: \\"(Saint Paul) spoke of one who has children, not of one who begets children.\\"[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the fact that clerical celibacy functioned as a spiritual discipline, it also was guarantor of the independence of the Church and of its essential dimension as a spiritual institution ordered toward ends beyond the competence and authority of temporal rulers.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, Roman authority in western Europe completely collapsed. However, the city of Rome, under the guidance of the Catholic Church, still remained a centre of learning and did much to preserve classical Roman culture in Western Europe. The classical heritage flourished throughout the Middle Ages in both the Byzantine Greek East and the Latin West. Philosopher Will Durant argues that certain prominent features of Plato's ideal community were discernible in the organization, dogma and effectiveness of the medieval Church in Europe:[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clergy, like Plato's guardians, were placed in authority... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and church. In the latter half of the period in which they ruled [800 AD onwards], the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire [for such guardians].... [Clerical] Celibacy was part of the psychological structure of the power of the clergy; for on the one hand they were unimpeded by the narrowing egoism of the family, and on the other their apparent superiority to the call of the flesh added to the awe in which lay sinners held them.... In the latter half of the period in which they ruled, the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his book The Ruling Class, Gaetano Mosca wrote of the medieval Church and its structure:\\r\\n\\r\\n...the Catholic Church has always aspired to a preponderant share in political power, it has never  been able to monopolize it entirely, because of two traits, chiefly, that are basic in its structure. Celibacy has generally been required of the clergy and of monks. Therefore no real dynasties of abbots and bishops have ever been able to establish themselves.... Secondly, in spite of numerous examples to the contrary supplied by the warlike Middle Ages, the ecclesiastical calling has by its very nature never been strictly compatible with the bearing of arms. The precept that exhorts the Church to abhor bloodshed has never dropped completely out of sight, and in relatively tranquil and orderly times it has always been very much to the fore.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is sometimes claimed that celibacy became mandatory for Latin Church priests only in the eleventh century; but others say, for instance: \\"(I)t may fairly be said that by the time of St. Leo the Great (440ÿ61) the law of celibacy was generally recognized in the West,\\"[23] and that the eleventh-century regulations on this matter, as on simony, should obviously not be interpreted as meaning that either non-celibacy or simony were previously permitted.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nCelibacy as a requirement for ordination to the priesthood (in the Western Church) and to the episcopate (in East as well as in West) and declaring marriages of priests invalid[25] (in both East and West) were important points of disagreement during the Protestant Reformation, with the Reformers arguing that these requirements were contrary to Biblical teaching in 1 Timothy 4:1-5, Hebrews 13:4, and 1 Corinthians 9:5, and implied a degradation of marriage, and were one reason for \\"many abominations\\"[26][27] and for widespread sexual misconduct within the clergy at the time of the Reformation.[28] The doctrinal view of the Reformers on this point was reflected in the marriages of Zwingli in 1522, Luther in 1525, and Calvin in 1539; in England, the married Thomas Cranmer was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1533. Both of these actions, marriage after ordination to the priesthood and consecration of a married man as a bishop, went against the long-standing tradition of the Church in the East as well as in the West. See Clerical marriage.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing recommendations made at the Second Vatican Council, the Latin Church now admits married men of mature age to ordination as deacons, to remain permanently as deacons and not as part of the process by which aspirants are temporarily deacons on their way to priestly ordination.[29][30] The change was effected by Pope Paul VI's motu proprio Sacrum diaconatus ordinem of 18 June 1967.[31] A candidate for ordination to the permanent diaconate must have reached a certain minimum age and must have the written consent of his wife.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrdination even to the diaconate is an impediment to a later marriage (for example, if a man who was already married by the time of ordination to the diaconate subsequently becomes a widower), though special dispensation can be received for remarriage under extenuating circumstances.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nGarry Wills, in his book Papal Sin: Structures of Deceit, argued that the imposition of celibacy among Catholic priests played a pivotal role in the cultivation of the Church as one of the most influential institutions in the world. In his discussion concerning the origins of the said policy, Wills mentioned that the Church drew its inspiration from the ascetics, monks who devote themselves to meditation and total abstention from earthly wealth and pleasures in order to sustain their corporal and spiritual purity, after seeing that its initial efforts in propagating the faith were fruitless. The rationale behind such strict policy is that it significantly helps the priests perform well in their religious services while at the same time following the manner in which Jesus Christ lived his life. Moreover, the author also mentioned that although the said policy insists on helping priests focus more on ecclesiastical duties, it also enabled the Church to control the wealth amassed by the clerics through their various religious activities, hence contributing to the growing power of the institution.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Latin Church discipline continues to be debated for a variety of reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, many believe celibacy was not required of the apostles. Peter himself had a wife at the time of Jesus' ministry, whose mother Jesus healed of a high fever.[34] And 1 Corinthians 9:5 is commonly interpreted as saying that years later, Peter and other apostles were accompanied by their wives. However, on the basis especially of Luke 18:28-30, others think the apostles left their wives, and that the women mentioned in 1 Corinthians as accompanying some apostles were \\"holy women, who, in accordance with Jewish custom, ministered to their teachers of their substance, as we read was the practice with even our Lord himself.\\"[35][36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, this requirement excludes a great number of otherwise qualified men from the priesthood, qualifications which according to the defenders of celibacy should be determined not by merely human hermeneutics but by the hermeneutics of the divine. Supporters of clerical celibacy answer that God only calls men to the priesthood if they are capable. Those who are not called to the priesthood should seek other paths in life since they will be able to serve God better there. Therefore, to the supporters of celibacy no one who is called is excluded.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, some say that resisting the natural sexual impulse in this way is unrealistic and harmful for a healthy life. Sexual scandals among priests, especially homosexuality and pedophilia, the defenders say, are a breach of the Church's discipline, not a result of it, especially since only a small percentage of priests have been involved.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, it is said that mandatory celibacy distances priests from this experience of life, compromising their moral authority in the pastoral sphere, although its defenders argue that the Church's moral authority is rather enhanced by a life of total self-giving in imitation of Christ, a practical application of the Vatican II teaching that \\"man cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself.\\"[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1970, nine German theologians, including Joseph Ratzinger (the future Pope Benedict XVI), signed a letter calling for a new discussion of the law of celibacy, though refraining from making a statement as to whether the law of celibacy should in fact be changed.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, hundreds of German, Austrian, and Swiss theologians (249 as of 15 February 2011[40]) signed a letter calling for married priests, as well as for women in Church ministry.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring and after the Council, the Magisterium of the Catholic Church has repeatedly re-affirmed the permanent value of the discipline of obligatory clerical celibacy in the Latin Church.[42] Pope John Paul II wrote in 1992:[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe synod fathers clearly and forcefully expressed their thought on this matter in an important proposal which deserves to be quoted here in full: \\"While in no way interfering with the discipline of the Oriental churches, the synod, in the conviction that perfect chastity in priestly celibacy is a charism, reminds priests that celibacy is a priceless gift of God for the Church and has a prophetic value for the world today. This synod strongly reaffirms what the Latin Church and some Oriental rites require, that is that the priesthood be conferred only on those men who have received from God the gift of the vocation to celibate chastity (without prejudice to the tradition of some Oriental churches and particular cases of married clergy who convert to Catholicism, which are admitted as exceptions in Pope Paul VI's encyclical on priestly celibacy, no. 42). The synod does not wish to leave any doubts in the mind of anyone regarding the Church's firm will to maintain the law that demands perpetual and freely chosen celibacy for present and future candidates for priestly ordination in the Latin rite.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe added that the \\"unchanging\\" essence of ordination \\"configures the priest to Jesus Christ the Head and Spouse of the Church.\\" Thus, he said, \\"The Church, as the Spouse of Jesus Christ, wishes to be loved by the priest in the total and exclusive manner in which Jesus Christ her Head and Spouse loved her.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere has never been any doubt, however, that it is an ecclesiastical discipline, as the Council Fathers explicitly recognised when they stated that \\"it is not demanded by the very nature of the priesthood.\\"[44] Pope John Paul II took up this theme when he said at a public audience on 17 July 1993 that celibacy \\"does not belong to the essence of priesthood.\\"[45]  He went on to speak of its aptness for, and its congruence with, the requirements of sacred orders, asserting that the discipline \\"enters into the logic of [priestly] consecration.\\"[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nYet some commentators have argued for the possibility that married men of proven seriousness and maturity (viri probati, taking up a phrase which appears in the first-century First Epistle of Clement in a different context)[47] might be ordained to a localized and modified form of the priesthood.[48] The topic of viri probati was raised by some participants in discussions at Ordinary General Assembly XI of the Synod of Bishops held at the Vatican in October 2005 on the theme of the Eucharist, but it was rejected as a solution for the insufficiency of priests.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nPope Francis shared his views on celibacy, and the possibility of church discussion on the topic, when he was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, recorded in the book On Heaven and Earth, a record of conversations conducted with a Buenos Aires rabbi.[50] He commented that celibacy \\"is a matter of discipline, not of faith. It can change\\" but added: \\"For the moment, I am in favor of maintaining celibacy, with all its pros and cons, because we have ten centuries of good experiences rather than failures.... Tradition has weight and validity.\\"[51]  He said that now the rule must be strictly adhered to, and any priest who cannot obey it \\"has to leave the ministry.\\"[51] National Catholic Reporter Vatican analyst, Jesuit Thomas J. Reese, called Bergoglio's use of \\"conditional language\\" regarding the rule of celibacy \\"remarkable.\\"[50]  He said that phrases like \\"for the moment\\" and \\"for now\\" are \\"not the kind of qualifications one normally hears when bishops and cardinals discuss celibacy.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a conversation with Bishop Erwin Krautler about mandatory celibacy on 4 April 2014, the Pope also spoke about a possible mechanism for a change starting with national bishop conferences. These conferences would\\r\\n\\r\\nseek and find consensus on reform and we should then bring up our suggestions for reform in Rome.  The pope explained that he could not take everything in hand personally from Rome. We local bishops, who are best acquainted with the needs of our faithful, should be corajudos, that is courageous in Spanish, and make concrete suggestions.... It was up to the bishops to make suggestions, the pope said again.[52]\\r\\nIn 2018 Francis showed that he wanted the topic discussed, beginning with remote areas like Amazonia that have a shortage of priests.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nExceptions to the rule of celibacy for priests of the Latin Church are sometimes granted by authority of the Pope, when married Protestant clergy become Catholic. Thus married Anglicans have been ordained to the Catholic priesthood in personal ordinariates and through the United States Pastoral Provision. Because the rule of celibacy is an ecclesiastical law and not a doctrine, it can, in principle, be changed at any time by the Pope. Nonetheless, both Pope Benedict XVI and his predecessors have spoken clearly of their understanding that the traditional practice was not likely to change.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Richard McBrien, a controversial voice within the Church, argued that the existence of these exceptions, coupled with a declining number of priests in active ministry (per McBrien's North America and in Europe)[citation needed][clarification needed] and reported cases of non-observance of the norm will keep the subject in the spotlight.[55] However, the number of priests worldwide has been increasing in the past two decades,[56][57][58] reversing the downward tendency of the 1970s and 1980s.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, the Eastern Catholic Churches allow ordination of married men as priests. Within the lands of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the largest Eastern Rite Catholic Church, priests' children often became priests and married within their social group, establishing a tightly-knit hereditary caste.[60] In North America, by the provisions of the decree Cum data fuerit, and for fear that married priests would create scandal among Latin Church Catholics, Eastern Catholic bishops were directed to ordain only unmarried men. This ban, which some bishops determined to be null in various circumstances or at times or simply decided not to enforce, was finally rescinded by a decree of June 2014.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nA condition for becoming an Eastern Catholic bishop is to be unmarried or a widower.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mainly Lebanese Maronite Church doesn't demand celibacy vows from its deacons or parish priests;[citation needed] their monks, however, are celibate, as well as their bishops who are normally selected from celibate priests and sometimesfrom the monasteries. The current Patriarch of the Maronite Church is originally a monk in the Mariamite Maronite Order.","input":"When was celibacy introduced in the catholic church?"},{"output":"c.

The first passage is 1 Corinthians 11:2ÿ16, dealing with praying and prophesying with head covering.[6] The second passage is 1 Corinthians 14:34ÿ35, whose authenticity has been hotly debated. Part of the reason for doubt is that in some manuscripts, the verses come at the end of the chapter instead of at its present location. Furthermore, Paul is here appealing to the law which is uncharacteristic of him. Lastly, the verses come into conflict with 11:5 where women are described as praying and prophesying.[7] As well, 10:1-22 is sometimes regarded as another letter fragment, interpolation, or inserted midrash because, among other things, this section virtually seems to equate the consumption of idol meat with idolatry, but Paul seems more lenient regarding its consumption in 8:1-13 and 10:23-11:1.[8] Such views are rejected by other scholars who give formidable arguments for the unity of 8:1-11:1.[9]\\r\\nAbout the year AD 50, towards the end of his second missionary journey, Paul founded the church in Corinth, before moving on to Ephesus, a city on the west coast of today's Turkey, about 180 miles by sea from Corinth. From there he traveled to Caesarea, and Antioch. Paul returned to Ephesus on his third missionary journey and spent approximately three years there (Acts 19:8, 19:10, 20:31). It was while staying in Ephesus that he received disconcerting news of the community in Corinth regarding jealousies, rivalry, and immoral behavior.[10] It also appears that based on a letter the Corinthians sent Paul (e.g. 7:1), the congregation was requesting clarification on a number of matters, such as marriage and the consumption of meat previously offered to idols.\\r\\nBy comparing Acts of the Apostles 18:1ÿ17 and mentions of Ephesus in the Corinthian correspondence, scholars suggest that the letter was written during Paul's stay in Ephesus, which is usually dated as being in the range of AD 53ÿ57.[11][12]\\r\\nAnthony C. Thiselton suggests that it is possible that I Corinthians was written during Paul's first (brief) stay in Ephesus, at the end of his Second Journey, usually dated to early AD 54.[13] However, it is more likely that it was written during his extended stay in Ephesus, where he refers to sending Timothy to them (Acts 19:22, I Cor. 4:17).[10]\\r\\nThe epistle may be divided into seven parts:[14]\\r\\nNow concerning the contribution for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia Let all your things be done with charity. Greet one another with a holy kiss... I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha. The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.\\r\\nSome time before 2 Corinthians was written, Paul paid them a second visit (2 Cor. 12: 14; 2 Cor. 13: 1) to check some rising disorder (2 Cor. 2: 1; 2 Cor. 13: 2), and wrote them a letter, now lost (1 Cor. 5: 9). They had also been visited by Apollos (Acts 18: 27), perhaps by Peter (1 Cor. 1: 12), and by some Jewish Christians who brought with them letters of commendation from Jerusalem (1 Cor. 1: 12; 2 Cor. 3: 1; 2 Cor. 5: 16; 2 Cor. 11: 23).\\r\\nPaul wrote this letter to correct what he saw as erroneous views in the Corinthian church. Several sources informed Paul of conflicts within the church at Corinth: Apollos (Acts 19:1), a letter from the Corinthians, the \\"household of Chloe\\", and finally Stephanas and his two friends who had visited Paul (1:11; 16:17). Paul then wrote this letter to the Corinthians, urging uniformity of belief (\\"that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you\\", 1:10) and expounding Christian doctrine. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter to the church at Corinth (2 Corinthians 2:13; 8:6, 16ÿ18).\\r\\nIn general, divisions within the church at Corinth seem to be a problem, and Paul makes it a point to mention these conflicts in the beginning. Specifically, pagan roots still hold sway within their community. Paul wants to bring them back to what he sees as correct doctrine, stating that God has given him the opportunity to be a \\"skilled master builder\\" to lay the foundation and let others build upon it (1 Cor 3:10).\\r\\nLater, Paul wrote about immorality in Corinth by discussing an immoral brother, how to resolve personal disputes, and sexual purity. Regarding marriage, Paul states that it is better for Christians to remain unmarried, but that if they lacked self-control, it is better to marry than \\"burn\\" (?Ĳϫ) which Christians have traditionally thought meant to burn with sinful desires.[citation needed] The Epistle may include marriage as an apostolic practice in 1 Corinthians 9:5, \\"Do we not have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas (Peter)?\\" (In the last case, the letter concurs with Matthew 8:14, which mentions Peter having a mother-in-law and thus, by interpolation, a wife.) However, the Greek word for \\"wife\\" is the same word for \\"woman\\". The Early Church Fathers including Tertullian, Jerome, and Augustine state the Greek word is ambiguous and the women in 1 Corinthians 9:5 were women ministering to the Apostles as women ministered to Christ (cf Matthew 27:55, Luke 8:1ÿ3), and were not wives,[16] and assert they left their \\"offices of marriage\\" to follow Christ.[17]\\r\\nPaul also argues unmarried people must please God, just as married people must please their spouses. The letter is also notable for mentioning the role of women in churches, that for instance they must remain silent (1 Cor. 14:34ÿ35), and yet they have a role of prophecy and apparently speaking tongues in churches (11:2ÿ16). If 14:34-35 is not an interpolation, certain scholars resolve the tension between these texts by positing that wives were either contesting their husband's inspired speeches at church, or the wives/women were chatting and asking questions in a disorderly manner when others were giving inspired utterances. Their silence was unique to the particular situation in the Corinthian gatherings at that time, and on this reading, Paul did not intend his words to be universalized for all women of all churches of all eras.[18] After discussing his views on worshipping idols, Paul finally ends with his views on resurrection. He states that Christ died for our sins, and was buried, and rose on the third day according to the scriptures (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul then asks: \\"Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\\" (1 Cor. 15:12) and addresses the question of resurrection.\\r\\nThroughout the letter, Paul presents issues that are troubling the community in Corinth and offers ways to fix them. Paul states that this letter is to \\"admonish\\" them as beloved children. They are expected to become imitators of Jesus and follow the ways in Christ as he, Paul, teaches in all his churches (1 Cor. 4:14ÿ16).","input":"When was the first letter to the corinthians written?"},{"output":"Guangzhou","context":"According to the Demographia research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \\"urban area\\", as defined by the group's methodology.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the administrative divisions of China, there are three levels of cities, namely municipalities (), prefecture-level cities (A׫), and county-level cities (׫).

This is for a number of reasons: first, before the term \\"wedge\\" became common for high-loft short irons, the pitching wedge was actually numbered as the \\"10-iron\\" of a matched set, and to this day it follows the normal loft progression of the numbered irons. Also, even though it has been named a wedge, many matched iron sets for retail sale include the pitching wedge even when not including other wedges. Finally, the loft of modern irons has been reduced compared to older designs. This is both to compensate for cavity-back iron designs that launch the ball higher for a given loft, and to increase the distance carried by each club for the average golfer's clubhead speed. (Professionals now also use similar designs, preserving the gap in hitting distance between the amateur golfer and the pro.) As a result the loft of the pitching wedge decreased along with the numbered irons from a traditional loft of between 48ÿ54 to between 45ÿ50, similar to that of an older 8-iron. Many pitching wedges have a loft close to 50.\\r\\nThe pitching wedge is a very versatile club. Being on the cusp between numbered irons and wedges, the pitching wedge has generally accepted uses falling into either class. Used with a \\"full swing\\" similar to a short iron, a golfer can produce a high-trajectory shot that carries between 80ÿ130 yards (73ÿ119?m) (depending on a variety of factors such as swing and club design), then \\"bites\\" with little or no roll after initial impact. Used with an abbreviated \\"chipping\\" motion, the club can produce short (25ÿ45?yd (23ÿ41?m)) \\"lob\\" or \\"approach\\" shots. And with a \\"putting\\" motion, the club can lift the ball over rough or fringe onto the putting green from a short distance to the pin (10ÿ25?yd (9.1ÿ22.9?m)). This last kind of stroke is commonly called a \\"bump and run\\" and can be done with many other irons, generally with a loft equal or higher than a 7-iron.\\r\\nThese clubs are most commonly used with a full swing to produce high-altitude shots such as approaches to the green or lifting the ball over trees. They are also commonly used to \\"lay up\\" in front of a hazard or to create a better lie for the next shot, and for recovery from firmer rough or sometimes from sand when the ball is lying on top of the surface. The loft of a particular pitching wedge follows the progression of the numbered irons of the same set, and these sets can have subtle differences in the loft progression and starting loft of the set, so the loft of pitching wedges can vary widely between sets. The loft of a pitching wedge generally falls between 42 and 49 degrees, but the launch angle and the average carry distance of the club between sets are typically similar. Pitching wedges can also have between zero and 10 degrees of bounce, though most pitching wedges have very low bounce (only 2 or 3 degrees) as other wedges like gap wedges or sand wedges are more traditionally suited for play out of hazards or soft lies where high bounce is desired.","input":"What do you use a pitching wedge for?"},{"output":"seating guests","context":"In many denominations of the Christian Church, a Church usher (not to be confused with church greeter) is responsible for seating guests and maintaining the order and security of services.

Reacting on the rise of China, the United States has strategically sought to \\"rebalance\\" the Asia-Pacific region. It has also seen the merging of most of Europe into one economy and a shift of power from the G7 to the larger G20. Accompanying the NATO expansion, Ballistic Missile Defenses (BMD) were installed in East Europe. These marked important steps in the military globalization.\\r\\nEnvironmentalism has also become a mainstream concern in the post-Cold War era following the circulation of widely accepted evidence for human activity's effects on Earth's climate. The same heightened consciousness is true of terrorism, owing largely to the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and their global fallout.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring most of the latter half of the 20th century, the two most powerful states in the world were the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (USA). These two federations were called the world's superpowers.[7]\\r\\nFaced with the threat of growing Japanese, German and Italian fascism and a world war, the western Allies and the Soviet Union made an alliance of necessity during World War II.[7]\\r\\nThe alliance between the USA and USSR was simply against a greater common enemy and the two countries never really trusted each other. After the Axis was defeated, these two powers became highly suspicious of each other because of their vastly different ideologies.\\r\\nThis struggle, known as the Cold War, lasted from about 1946 to 1991, beginning with the second Red Scare and ending with the August Coup, a coup d'tat attempt that destabilized the Soviet Union and later contributed to its dissolution. Prominent Historian of the Cold War, John Lewis Gaddis, wrote at the dawn of the post-Cold War era that the characteristics of the new era are not yet certain but it is certain that it will be very different from the Cold War era and it means that a turning point of world historical significance took place:\\r\\nThe new world of the post-Cold War era is likely to have few, if any, of these [Cold War] characteristics: that is an indication of how much things have already changed since the Cold War ended. We are at one of those rare points of 'punctuation' in history at which old patterns of stability have broken up and new ones have not yet emerged to take their place. Historians will certainly regard the years 1989-1991 as a turning point comparable in importance to the years 1789-1794, or 1917-1918, or 1945-1947; precisely what has 'turned,' however, is much less certain. We know that a series of geopolitical earthquakes has taken place, but it is not yet clear how these upheavals have rearranged the landscape that lies before us.[8]\\r\\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union caused profound changes in nearly every society in the world. Much of the policy and infrastructure of the West and the Eastern Bloc had revolved around the capitalist and communist ideologies respectively and the possibility of a nuclear warfare.\\r\\nThe fall of communism formed an existential threat for many institutions. The US military was forced to cut much of its expenditure, though the level rose again to comparable heights after the September 11 attacks and the initiation of the War on Terror in 2001.[9]\\r\\nSocialist parties around the world saw drops in membership after the Berlin Wall fell and the public felt that free market ideology had won.[10]\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War also coincided with the end of apartheid in South Africa. Declining Cold War tensions in the later years of the 1980s meant that the apartheid regime was no longer supported by the West as a bulwark against communism and they were condemned with an embargo. In 1990, Nelson Mandela was freed from prison and the regime made steps to end apartheid, which were on an official basis completed by 1994 with the new election.\\r\\nLibertarian, neoliberal,[11] nationalist [11] and Islamist [11] parties on the other hand benefited from the fall of the Soviet Union. As capitalism had \\"won\\", as people saw it, socialism in general declined in popularity. Socialist Scandinavian countries privatized many of their commons in the 1990s and a political debate on modern institutions re-opened.[12] Scandinavian nations are now more seen as social democrat (see Nordic model).\\r\\nThe People's Republic of China, already having moved towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s and facing public anger after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing, moved even more quickly towards free market economics in the 1990s. McDonald's and Pizza Hut both entered the country in the second half of 1990, the first American chains in China aside from Kentucky Fried Chicken which had entered 3 years earlier in 1987. Stock markets were established in Shenzhen and Shanghai late in 1990 as well. The restrictions on car ownership were loosened in the early 1990s, causing the bicycle to decline as a form of transport by 2000.\\r\\nThe move to capitalism has increased the economic prosperity of China, but many people still live in poor conditions, working for companies for very small pay and in dangerous and poor conditions.[13]\\r\\nThe end of the Cold War allowed many technologies that were formerly off limits to the public to be declassified. The most important of these was the Internet, which was created as ARPANET by the Pentagon as a system to keep in touch following an impending nuclear war. The last restrictions on commercial enterprise online were lifted in 1995.[14]\\r\\nIn the approximately two decades since, the Internet's population and usefulness grew immensely. Only about 20 million people (less than 0.5 percent of the world's population at the time) were online in 1995, mostly in the US and several other Western countries.

The continental crust started to form 4 billion years ago (Ga), and six of the microcontinents collided to form the craton about 2 Ga. This core has been enlarged by plate tectonics, most notably between 1.8 and 1.65 Ga when a piece currently stretching from Arizona to Missouri fused with the south and west portion of the craton. The craton started to rift about 1.1 Ga, and the fissure (now the Midcontinent Rift System) ran between Kansas and Lake Superior before stopping, perhaps due to the Grenville collision in the east. Otherwise the craton has remained relatively stable, with some rocks dating from 2.5 to 4 Ga, including what may be the world's oldest known rock: Specimens from the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt on the coast of the Hudson Bay have been dated to 4.38 Ga,[6][7] though the dating methods are disputed.[8] Periodic flooding by inland seas, most recently the Western Interior Seaway during the Cretaceous, caused the layer of sedimentary rock over the remainder of the craton. The Laurentia craton is the center of the Proterozoic supercontinent Rodinia in most models,[9] and was also part of the later Laurussia, Pangea, and Laurasia supercontinents.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoughly 3 million years ago (Ma), the volcanic Isthmus of Panama formed between the North and South American continents creating a bridge over what was the Central American Seaway and allowing the migration of flora and fauna between the two landmasses in the Great American Interchange. Starting 2.58 Ma, the Quaternary glaciation covered much of the continent with ice, centered west of Hudson Bay, the floor of which is slowly rebounding after being depressed by the great weight of the ice. Glaciers descended the slopes of the Rocky Mountains and those of the Pacific Margin. Extensive glacial lakes, such as Glacial Lake Missoula, Bonneville, Lahontan, Agassiz, and Algonquin, formed by glacial melt water. \\"Remnants of them are still visible in the Great Basin and along the edge of the Canadian Shield in the form of the Great Salt Lake, the Great Lakes, and the large lakes of west central Canada.\\"[10] The last glacial period of the current ice age caused a lowering of the sea level, exposing the Bering Land Bridge between Alaska and Siberia, which resulted in human migration from Asia to the Americas between 40,000 and 15,000 years ago.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America may be divided into at least five major physiographic regions:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coastal Plain and the main belts of the North American Cordillera continue in the south in Mexico (where the Mexican Plateau, bordered by the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra Madre Occidental, is considered a continuation of the intermontane system) to connect the Transverse Volcanic Range, a zone of high and active volcanic peaks south of Mexico City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast majority of North America is located on the North American Plate, centered on the Laurentia craton.

The narrow plains in the Mexican coast and the savannas of the Mississippi are analogous to, respectively, the Patagonian steppes and the pampas of the Piranha, Paraguay, and Rio de la Plata. Thus the Appalachians and the mountain chains of Brazil are regarded as creating similar interruptions to the plains community.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America extends to within 10 of latitude of both the equator and the North Pole. It embraces every climatic zone, from tropical rain forest and savanna on the lowlands of Central America to areas of permanent ice cap in central Greenland.[14] Subarctic and tundra climates prevail in north Canada and north Alaska, and desert and semiarid conditions are found in interior regions cut off by high mountains from rain-bearing westerly winds.[12] However, most of the continent has temperate climates very favorable to settlement and agriculture. Prairies, or vast grasslands cover a huge amount in mountain ranges.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average rainfall in North America is 76?cm/year, which produces some 18 petaliters of water.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth American rivers include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run along the entire Pacific Coast, acting as a barrier to the humid winds that sweep in from the ocean. The rising topography forces this air upwards, causing moisture to condense and fall in the form of rain on the western slopes of the mountains, with some areas receiving more than 70 inches (1.8?m) of rainfall per year. As a result, the air has lost much of its moisture and becomes hot and dry when it reaches the areas east of the coastal mountain ranges.[12] These arid conditions are, in some instances, exacerbated in regions of extremely low altitude (some near or below sea level) by higher air pressure, resulting in drier conditions and adiabatic heating effects, some of these pocket deserts exist in valleys well north of the CanadaÿUS border in interior British Columbia.  What precipitation does fall generally does not last long, lost primarily to evaporation, as well as rapid runoff and efficient water uptake and storage by native vegetation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various plant life distributions in North America. Plant life in the Arctic includes grasses, mosses, and Arctic willows. Coniferous trees, including spruces, pines, hemlocks, and firs, are indigenous to the Canadian and Western U.S. mountain ranges as far south as San Francisco. Among these are giant sequoias, redwoods, great firs, and sugar pines. Sugar pines are generally confined to the northwestern area of the United States.\\r\\nThe central region of the country has hardwoods. Southern states grow extensive yellow pines. In addition, mahogany, logwood, and lignumvitae - all tropical in nature - are grown. The southwest has desert plants, including yucci and cacti. The cultivated native plants of North America are tobacco, maize, potato, vanilla, melons, cacao, gourds, indigo plant, and bean.\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America is home to many native mammal species.  Several species of deer, including elk, caribou, moose, mule deer, and the abundant white-tailed deer are found throughout various regions, along with the bison and musk ox in the central and northern plains, respectively.  Three species of bear, several subspecies of wolf, and various other carnivores such as raccoons, skunks, and cats including cougars and lynxes are widely distributed.  The family Mustelidae is well represented, including badgers, otters, ferrets, and wolverines.  Numerous species of squirrels and other rodents, such as beavers and muskrats, can be found in virtually every region of the continent.   Central America has adapted sloths, anteaters, and armadillos. Other animals includes the condor, among the heights of the Andes, the parrots and the monkeys of Tropical forests, the humming bird, rattlesnake, alligator, and Cayman of the banks of the streams, and swarms of mosquitoes on the wide plains.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mining and petroleum industries are important in Canada, the United States and Mexico. These natural resources make the region one of the richest on the earth.[1][1][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rocky Mountain region is known for vast resources and rich mineral deposits including copper, lead, gold, silver, tungsten, uranium, and zinc. Coal, petroleum and natural gas are mineral fuels found.[1][17] Old mine tailings are present in the Rocky Mountain landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgriculture and forestry are two major industries. Agriculture includes arid land and irrigated farming and livestock grazing.[1]  Livestock are often moved between high-elevation summer pastures and low-elevation and winter pastures.\\r\\n\\r\\nMap and aerial photos","input":"What is the highest landform in north america?"},{"output":"John Knox","context":"Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism which traces its origins to the British Isles, particularly Scotland.\\r\\nPresbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders. A great number of Reformed churches are organized this way, but the word Presbyterian, when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Scottish and English Presbyterians, as well as several English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War.[2] Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ. Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707[3] which created the Kingdom of Great Britain. In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America mostly by Scots and Scots-Irish immigrants. The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there are a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism. Local congregations of churches which use presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly).\\r\\nThe roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century; the example of John Calvin's Geneva being particularly influential. Most Reformed churches which trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government. In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches. Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches. Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists. Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scotch-Irish immigrants and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon Plan of Union of 1801 for frontier areas.[4] Along with Episcopalians, Presbyterians tend to be considerably wealthier[5] and better educated (having more graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita) than most other religious groups in United States,[6] and are disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business,[7] law and politics.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPresbyterian history is part of the history of Christianity, but the beginning of Presbyterianism as a distinct movement occurred during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation. As the Catholic Church resisted the reformers, several different theological movements splintered from the Church and bore different denominations. Presbyterianism was especially influenced by the French theologian John Calvin, who is credited with the development of Reformed theology, and the work of John Knox, a Scotsman and a Roman Catholic Priest, who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland. He brought back Reformed teachings to Scotland. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to England and Scotland. In August 1560 the Parliament of Scotland adopted the Scots Confession as the creed of the Scottish Kingdom. In December 1560, the First Book of Discipline was published, outlining important doctrinal issues but also establishing regulations for church government, including the creation of ten ecclesiastical districts with appointed superintendents which later became known as presbyteries.[9]\\r\\nIn time, the Scots Confession would be supplanted by the Westminster Confession of Faith, and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, which were formulated by the Westminster Assembly between 1643 and 1649.\\r\\nPresbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or \\"church order\\") and worship; often using a \\"Book of Order\\" to regulate common practice and order. The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism. Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups. Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document ÿ second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible ÿ in Presbyterian churches.\\r\\nPresbyterians place great importance upon education and lifelong learning. Continuous study of the scriptures, theological writings, and understanding and interpretation of church doctrine are embodied in several statements of faith and catechisms formally adopted by various branches of the church, often referred to as \\"subordinate standards\\". It is generally considered that the point of such learning is to enable one to put one's faith into practice; some Presbyterians generally exhibit their faith in action as well as words, by generosity, hospitality, as well as proclaiming the gospel of Christ.\\r\\nPresbyterian government is by councils (known as courts) of elders. Teaching and ruling elders are ordained and convene in the lowest council known as a session or consistory responsible for the discipline, nurture, and mission of the local congregation. Teaching elders (pastors) have responsibility for teaching, worship, and performing sacraments. Pastors are called by individual congregations. A congregation issues a call for the pastor's service, but this call must be ratified by the local presbytery.\\r\\nRuling elders are usually laymen (and laywomen in some denominations) who are elected by the congregation and ordained to serve with the teaching elders, assuming responsibility for nurture and leadership of the congregation. Often, especially in larger congregations, the elders delegate the practicalities of buildings, finance, and temporal ministry to the needy in the congregation to a distinct group of officers (sometimes called deacons, which are ordained in some denominations). This group may variously be known as a \\"Deacon Board\\", \\"Board of Deacons\\" \\"Diaconate\\", or \\"Deacons' Court\\". These are sometimes known as \\"presbyters\\" to the full congregation.\\r\\nAbove the sessions exist presbyteries, which have area responsibilities. These are composed of teaching elders and ruling elders from each of the constituent congregations. The presbytery sends representatives to a broader regional or national assembly, generally known as the General Assembly, although an intermediate level of a synod sometimes exists. This congregation / presbytery / synod / general assembly schema is based on the historical structure of the larger Presbyterian churches, such as the Church of Scotland or the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); some bodies, such as the Presbyterian Church in America and the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, skip one of the steps between congregation and General Assembly, and usually the step skipped is the Synod. The Church of Scotland abolished the Synod in 1993.[10]\\r\\nPresbyterian governance is practised by Presbyterian denominations and also by many other Reformed churches.[11]\\r\\nPresbyterianism is historically a confessional tradition. This has two implications. The obvious one is that confessional churches express their faith in the form of \\"confessions of faith,\\" which have some level of authoritative status. However this is based on a more subtle point: In confessional churches, theology is not solely an individual matter. While individuals are encouraged to understand Scripture, and may challenge the current institutional understanding, theology is carried out by the community as a whole. It is this community understanding of theology that is expressed in confessions.[13]\\r\\nHowever, there has arisen a spectrum of approaches to confessionalism. The manner of subscription, or the degree to which the official standards establish the actual doctrine of the church, turns out to be a practical matter. That is, the decisions rendered in ordination and in the courts of the church largely determine what the church means, representing the whole, by its adherence to the doctrinal standard.\\r\\nSome Presbyterian traditions adopt only the Westminster Confession of Faith as the doctrinal standard to which teaching elders are required to subscribe, in contrast to the Larger and Shorter catechisms, which are approved for use in instruction. Many Presbyterian denominations, especially in North America, have adopted all of the Westminster Standards as their standard of doctrine which is subordinate to the Bible. These documents are Calvinistic in their doctrinal orientation. The Presbyterian Church in Canada retains the Westminster Confession of Faith in its original form, while admitting the historical period in which it was written should be understood when it is read.\\r\\nThe Westminster Confession is \\"The principal subordinate standard of the Church of Scotland\\" but \\"with due regard to liberty of opinion in points which do not enter into the substance of the Faith\\" (V). This formulation represents many years of struggle over the extent to which the confession reflects the Word of God and the struggle of conscience of those who came to believe it did not fully do so (e.g. William Robertson Smith). Some Presbyterian Churches, such as the Free Church of Scotland, have no such \\"conscience clause\\".\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has adopted the Book of Confessions, which reflects the inclusion of other Reformed confessions in addition to the Westminster Standards. These other documents include ancient creedal statements (the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed), 16th-century Reformed confessions (the Scots Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic Confession), and 20th century documents (The Theological Declaration of Barmen, Confession of 1967 and A Brief Statement of Faith).\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church in Canada developed the confessional document Living Faith (1984) and retains it as a subordinate standard of the denomination. It is confessional in format, yet like the Westminster Confession, draws attention back to original Bible text.\\r\\nPresbyterians in Ireland who rejected Calvinism and the Westminster Confessions formed the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland.\\r\\nPresbyterian denominations that trace their heritage to the British Isles usually organise their church services inspired by the principles in the Directory of Public Worship, developed by the Westminster Assembly in the 1640s. This directory documented Reformed worship practices and theology adopted and developed over the preceding century by British Puritans, initially guided by John Calvin and John Knox. It was enacted as law by the Scottish Parliament, and became one of the foundational documents of Presbyterian church legislation elsewhere.\\r\\nHistorically, the driving principle in the development of the standards of Presbyterian worship is the Regulative principle of worship, which specifies that (in worship), what is not commanded is forbidden.[14]\\r\\nOver subsequent centuries, many Presbyterian churches modified these prescriptions by introducing hymnody, instrumental accompaniment, and ceremonial vestments into worship. However, there is not one fixed \\"Presbyterian\\" worship style. Although there are set services for the \\"Lord's Day\\", one can find a service to be evangelical and even revivalist in tone (especially in some conservative denominations), or strongly liturgical, approximating the practices of Lutheranism or Anglicanism (especially where Scottish tradition is esteemed),[clarification needed] or semi-formal, allowing for a balance of hymns, preaching, and congregational participation (favored by probably most American Presbyterians). Most Presbyterian churches follow the traditional liturgical year and observe the traditional holidays, holy seasons, such as Advent, Christmas, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week, Easter, Pentecost, etc. They also make use of the appropriate seasonal liturgical colors, etc. Many, incorporate ancient liturgical prayers and responses into the communion services and follow a daily, seasonal, and festival lectionary. Other Presbyterians, however, such as the Reformed Presbyterians, would practice a cappella exclusive psalmody, as well as eschew the celebration of holy days.\\r\\nAmong the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, in which some Presbyterians are involved, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.\\r\\nPresbyterians traditionally have held the Worship position that there are only two sacraments:\\r\\nEarly Presbyterians were careful to distinguish between the \\"church,\\" which referred to the members, and the \\"meeting house,\\" which was the building in which the church met.[15] Until the late 19th century, very few Presbyterians ever referred to their buildings as \\"churches.\\" Presbyterians believed that meeting-houses (now called churches) are buildings to support the worship of God. The decor in some instances was austere so as not to detract from worship. Early Presbyterian meeting-houses were extremely plain. No stained glass, no elaborate furnishings, and no images were to be found in the meeting-house. The pulpit, often raised so as only to be accessible by a staircase, was the centerpiece of the building. But these were not the standard characteristics of the mainline Presbyterians. These were more of the wave of Presbyterians that were influenced by the Puritans and simplicity.\\r\\nIn the late 19th century a gradual shift began to occur. Prosperous congregations built imposing churches, such as Fourth Presbyterian Church of Chicago and Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City, and many others.\\r\\nUsually a Presbyterian church will not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a \\"communion table,\\" usually on the same level as the congregation. There may be a rail between the communion table and the \\"Chancel\\" behind it, which may contain a more decorative altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the \\"empty\\" cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. You may also find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel. St. Giles Cathedral ( Church Of Scotland- The Mother Church of Presbyterians) does have a Crucifix next to one of the Pulpits that hangs alongside. The image of Christ is more of faint image and more modern design.\\r\\nThere is a Church of Scotland (Presbyterian) in central Paris The Scots Kirk, Paris which is English-speaking, and is attended by many nationalities. It maintains close links with the Church of Scotland in Scotland itself; as well as with the Reformed Church of France.\\r\\nJohn Knox (1505ÿ1572), a Scot who had spent time studying under Calvin in Geneva, returned to Scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines. After a period of religious convulsion and political conflict culminating in a victory for the Protestant party at the Siege of Leith the authority of the Catholic Church was abolished in favour of Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560. The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines to become the national Church of Scotland. King James VI and I moved the Church of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government, and in 1637, James' successor, Charles I and William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to force the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer. What resulted was an armed insurrection, with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant. The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade, and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, despite the initial support that he received from the Covenanters, reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church.\\r\\nHowever, with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Church of Scotland was finally unequivocally recognised as a Presbyterian institution by the monarch due to Scottish Presbyterian support for the aforementioned revolution and the Acts of Union 1707 between Scotland and England guaranteed the Church of Scotland's form of government. However, legislation by the United Kingdom parliament allowing patronage led to splits in the Church. In 1733, a group of ministers seceded from the Church of Scotland to form the Associate Presbytery, another group seceded in 1761 to form the Relief Church and the Disruption of 1843 led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland. Further splits took place, especially over theological issues, but most Presbyterians in Scotland were reunited by 1929 union of the established Church of Scotland and the United Free Church of Scotland.\\r\\nThe Presbyterian denominations in Scotland today are the Church of Scotland, the Free Church of Scotland, the United Free Church of Scotland, the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing), the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, the Associated Presbyterian Church (Associated Presbyterian Churches), and the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland.\\r\\nWithin Scotland the term kirk is usually used to refer to a local Presbyterian church. Informally, the term 'The Kirk' refers to the Church of Scotland. Some of the values and ideals espoused in Scottish presbyterian denominations can be reflected in this reference in a book from Norman Drummond, chaplain to the Queen in Scotland.[16]\\r\\nIn England, Presbyterianism was established in secret in 1592. Thomas Cartwright is thought to be the first Presbyterian in England. Cartwright's controversial lectures at Cambridge University condemning the episcopal hierarchy of the Elizabethan Church led to his deprivation of his post by Archbishop John Whitgift and his emigration abroad. Between 1645 and 1648, a series of ordinances of the Long Parliament established Presbyterianism as the polity of the Church of England. Presbyterian government was established in London and Lancashire and in a few other places in England, although Presbyterian hostility to the execution of Charles I and the establishment of the republican Commonwealth of England meant that Parliament never enforced the Presbyterian system in England. The re-establishment of the monarchy in 1660 brought the return of Episcopal church government in England (and in Scotland for a short time); but the Presbyterian church in England continued in Non-Conformity, outside of the established church. In 1719 a major split, the Salter's Hall controversy, occurred; with the majority siding with nontrinitarian views. Thomas Bradbury published several sermons bearing on the controversy, and in 1719, \\"An answer to the reproaches cast on the dissenting ministers who subscribed their belief of the Eternal Trinity.\\". By the 18th century many English Presbyterian congregations had become Unitarian in doctrine.\\r\\nA number of new Presbyterian Churches were founded by Scottish immigrants to England in the 19th century and later. Following the 'Disruption' in 1843 many of those linked to the Church of Scotland eventually joined what became the Presbyterian Church of England in 1876. Some, that is Crown Court (Covent Garden, London), St Andrew's (Stepney, London) and Swallow Street (London), did not join the English denomination, which is why there are Church of Scotland congregations in England such as those at Crown Court, and St Columba's, Pont Street (Knightsbridge) in London. There is also a congregation in the heart of London's financial district called London City Presbyterian Church that is also affiliated with Free Church of Scotland.\\r\\nIn 1972, the Presbyterian Church of England (PCofE) united with the Congregational Church in England and Wales to form the United Reformed Church (URC). Among the congregations the PCofE brought to the URC were Tunley (Lancashire), Aston Tirrold (Oxfordshire) and John Knox Presbyterian Church, Stepney, London (now part of Stepney Meeting House URC) ÿ these are among the sole survivors today of the English Presbyterian churches of the 17th century. The URC also has a presence in Scotland, mostly of former Congregationalist Churches. Two former Presbyterian congregations, St Columba's, Cambridge (founded in 1879), and St Columba's, Oxford (founded as a chaplaincy by the PCofE and the Church of Scotland in 1908 and as a congregation of the PCofE in 1929), continue as congregations of the URC and university chaplaincies of the Church of Scotland.\\r\\nIn recent years a number of smaller denominations adopting Presbyterian forms of church government have organised in England, including the International Presbyterian Church planted by evangelical theologian Francis Schaeffer of L'Abri Fellowship in the 1970s, and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales founded in the North of England in the late 1980s.\\r\\nIn Wales, Presbyterianism is represented by the Presbyterian Church of Wales, which was originally composed largely of Calvinistic Methodists who accepted Calvinist theology rather than the Arminianism of the Wesleyan Methodists. They broke off from the Church of England in 1811, ordaining their own ministers. They were originally known as the Calvinist Methodist connexion and in the 1920s it became alternatively known as the Presbyterian Church of Wales.\\r\\nPresbyterianism is the largest Protestant denomination in Northern Ireland and the second largest on the island of Ireland (after the Anglican Church of Ireland),[citation needed] and was brought by Scottish plantation settlers to Ulster who had been strongly encouraged to emigrate by James VI of Scotland, later James I of Ireland and England. An estimated 100,000 Scottish Presbyterians moved to the northern counties of Ireland between 1607 and the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[citation needed] The Presbytery of Ulster was formed in 1642 separately from the established Anglican Church. Presbyterians, along with Roman Catholics in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, suffered under the discriminatory Penal Laws until they were revoked in the early 19th century. Presbyterianism is represented in Ireland by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.\\r\\nFurther information: Waldensian\\r\\nThe Waldensian Evangelical Church (Chiesa Evangelica Valdese, CEV) is an Italian Protestant denomination. The church was founded in the 12th century, and centuries later, after the Protestant Reformation, it adhered to Calvinist theology and became the Italian branch of the Presbyterian churches. As such, the church is a member of the World Communion of Reformed Churches.\\r\\nEven before Presbyterianism spread with immigrants abroad from Scotland, there were divisions in the larger Presbyterian family. Some later rejoined only to separate again. In what some interpret as rueful self-reproach, some Presbyterians refer to the divided Presbyterian churches as the \\"Split P's\\".\\r\\nPresbyterianism first officially arrived in Colonial America in 1644 with the establishment of Christ's First Presbyterian Church in Hempstead, NY. The Church was organized by the Rev. Richard Denton.\\r\\nAnother notable church was established in 1703 the first Presbytery in Philadelphia. In time, the presbytery would be joined by two more to form a synod (1717) and would eventually evolve into the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in 1789. The nation's largest Presbyterian denomination, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) ÿ PC (USA) ÿ can trace their heritage back to the original PCUSA, as can the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC), the Bible Presbyterian Church (BPC), the Cumberland Presbyterian Church (CPC), the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), and the Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians (ECO).\\r\\nOther Presbyterian bodies in the United States include the Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America (RPCNA), the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church (ARP), the Reformed Presbyterian Church in the United States (RPCUS), the Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly, the Reformed Presbyterian Church ÿ Hanover Presbytery, the Covenant Presbyterian Church, the Presbyterian Reformed Church, the Westminster Presbyterian Church in the United States, the Korean American Presbyterian Church, and the Free Presbyterian Church of North America.\\r\\nThe territory within about a 50-mile (80?km) radius of Charlotte, North Carolina, is historically the greatest concentration of Presbyterianism in the Southern United States, while an almost identical geographic area around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, contains probably the largest number of Presbyterians in the entire nation.\\r\\nThe PC (USA), beginning with its predecessor bodies, has, in common with other so-called \\"mainline\\" Protestant denominations, experienced a significant decline in members in recent years. Some estimates have placed that loss at nearly half in the last forty years.[17]\\r\\nPresbyterian influence, especially through Princeton theology can be traced in modern Evangelicalism. Balmer says that:\\r\\nEvangelicalism itself, I believe, is quintessentially North American phenomenon, deriving as it did from the confluence of Pietism, Presbyterianism, and the vestiges of Puritanism. Evangelicalism picked up the peculiar characteristics from each strain ÿ warmhearted spirituality from the Pietists (for instance), doctrinal precisionism from the Presbyterians, and individualistic introspection from the Puritans ÿ even as the North American context itself has profoundly shaped the various manifestations of evangelicalism: fundamentalism, neo-evangelicalism, the holiness movement, Pentecostalism, the charismatic movement, and various forms of African-American and Hispanic evangelicalism.[18]\\r\\nIn the late 1800s, Presbyterian missionaries established a presence in what is now northern New Mexico. This provided an alternative to the Catholicism, which was brought to the area by the Spanish Conquistadors and had remained unchanged. The area experienced a \\"mini\\" reformation, in that many converts were made to Presbyterianism, prompting persecution. In some cases, the converts left towns and villages to establish their own neighboring villages. The arrival of the United States to the area prompted the Catholic church to modernize and make efforts at winning the converts back, many of which did return. However, there are still stalwart Presbyterians and Presbyterian churches in the area.\\r\\nIn Canada, the largest Presbyterian denomination ÿ and indeed the largest Protestant denomination ÿ was the Presbyterian Church in Canada, formed in 1875 with the merger of four regional groups. In 1925, the United Church of Canada was formed by the majority of Presbyterians combining with the Methodist Church, Canada, and the Congregational Union of Canada. A sizable minority of Canadian Presbyterians, primarily in southern Ontario but also throughout the entire nation, withdrew, and reconstituted themselves as a non-concurring continuing Presbyterian body. They regained use of the original name in 1939.\\r\\nPresbyterianism arrived in Latin America in the 19th century.\\r\\nThe biggest Presbyterian church is the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico (Iglesia Nacional Presbiteriana de Mxico), which has around 2,500,000 members and associates and 3000 congregations, but there are other small denominations like the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church in Mexico which was founded in 1875 by the Associate Reformed Church in North America. The Independent Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Reformed Church in Mexico, the National Conservative Presbyterian Church in Mexico are existing churches in the Reformed tradition.\\r\\nIn Brazil, the Presbyterian Church of Brazil (Igreja Presbiteriana do Brasil) totals approximately 1,011,300 members;[19] other Presbyterian churches (Independents, United, Conservatives, Renovated, etc.) in this nation have around 350,000 members. The Renewed Presbyterian Church in Brazil was influenced by the charismatic movement and has about 131?000 members as of 2011.[20] The Conservative Presbyterian Church was founded in 1940 and has eight presbyteries.[21] The Fundamentalist Presbyterian church in Brazil was influenced by Karl McIntire and the Bible Presbyterian church USA and has around 1?800 members. The Independent Presbyterian Church in Brasil was founded in 1903 by pastor Pereira, has 500 congregations and 75?000 members. The United Presbyterian Church in Brazil has around 4?000 members. There are also ethnic Korean Presbyterian churches in the country. The Evangelical Reformed Church in Brazil has Dutch origin. The Reformed Churches in Brazil were recently founded by the Canadian Reformed Churches with the Reformed Church in the Netherlands (liberated).\\r\\nCongregational churches present in the country are also part of the Calvinistic tradition in Latin America.\\r\\nThere are probably more than four million members of Presbyterian churches in all of Latin America. Presbyterian churches are also present in Peru, Bolivia, Cuba, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Colombia, Chile, Paraguay, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Argentina and others, but with few members. The Presbyterian Church in Belize has 14 churches and church plants and there is a Reformed Seminary founded in 2004. Some Latin Americans in North America are active in the Presbyterian Cursillo Movement.\\r\\nPresbyterianism arrived in Africa in the 19th century through the work of Scottish missionaries and founded churches such as St Michael and All Angels Church, Blantyre, Malawi. The church has grown extensively and now has a presence in at least 23 countries in the region.[22]\\r\\nAfrican Presbyterian churches often incorporate diaconal ministries, including social services, emergency relief, and the operation of mission hospitals. A number of partnerships exist between presbyteries in Africa and the PC(USA), including specific connections with Lesotho, Malawi, South Africa, Ghana and Zambia. For example, the Lackawanna Presbytery, located in Northeastern Pennsylvania, has a partnership with a presbytery in Ghana. Also the Southminster Presbyterian Church, located near Pittsburgh, has partnerships with churches in Malawi and Kenya. The Presbyterian Church of Nigeria, western Africa is also healthy and strong in mostly the southern states of this nation, strong density in the south-eastern states of this country. Beginning from Cross River state, the nearby coastal states, Rivers state, Lagos state to Ebonyi and Abia States. The missionary expedition of Mary Slessor and Hope Waddel and their group in the mid 18th century in this coastal regions of the ten British colony has brought about the beginning and the flourishing of this church in these areas.\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church of East Africa, based in Kenya, is particularly strong, with 500 clergy and 4 million members.[23]\\r\\nThe Reformed Presbyterian Church in Malawi has 150 congregations and 17?000ÿ20?000 members. It was a mission of the Free Presbyterian church of Scotland. The Restored Reformed Church works with RPCM. Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Malawi is an existing small church. Part of the Presbyterian Church in Malawi and Zambia is known as CCAP, Church of Central Africa-Presbyterian. Often the churches there have one main congregation and a number of Prayer Houses develop. education, health ministries as well as worship and spiritual development are important.\\r\\nSouthern Africa is a major base of Reformed and Presbyterian Churches.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition also there are a number of Presbyterian Churches in north Africa, the most known is the Nile Synod in Egypt and a recently founded synod for Sudan.\\r\\nCumberland Presbyterian Church Yao Dao Secondary School is a Presbyterian school in Yuen Long, New Territories. The Cumberland Presbyterian Church also have a church on the island of Cheung Chau. There are also Korean Christians resident in Hong Kong who are Presbyterians.[citation needed]\\r\\nPresbyterian Churches are the biggest and by far the most influential Protestant denominations in South Korea, with close to 20,000 churches affiliated with the two largest Presbyterian denominations in the country.[24] In South Korea there are 15 million Protestants and about 9 million are Presbyterians. In South Korea there are 100 different Presbyterian denominations.[25]\\r\\nMost of the Korean Presbyterian denominations share the same name in Korean, ???????? (literally means the Presbyterian Church of Korea or PCK), tracing its roots to the United Presbyterian Assembly before its long history of disputes and schisms. The Presbyterian schism began with the controversy in relation to the Japanese shrine worship enforced during the Japanese colonial period and the establishment of a minor division (Koryu-pa, ???, later The Koshin Presbyterian Church in Korea, Koshin ??) in 1952. And in 1953 the second schism happened when the theological orientation of the Chosun Seminary (later Hanshin University) founded in 1947 could not be tolerated in the PCK and another minor group (The Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea, Kijang, ??) was separated. The last major schism had to do with the issue of whether the PCK should join the WCC. The controversy divided the PCK into two denominations, The Presbyterian Church of Korea (Tonghap, ??) and The General Assembly of Presbyterian Church in Korea (Hapdong, ??) in 1959. All major seminaries associated with each denomination claim heritage from the Pyung Yang Theological Seminary, therefore, not only Presbyterian University and Theological Seminary and Chongsin University which are related to PCK but also Hanshin University of PROK all celebrated the 100th class in 2007, 100 years from the first graduates of Pyung Yang Theological Seminary.[26]\\r\\nKorean Presbyterian denominations are active in evangelism and many of its missionaries are being sent overseas, being the second biggest missionary sender in the world after the United States. GSM, the missionary body of the \\"Hapdong\\" General Assembly of Presbyterian Churches of Korea, is the single largest Presbyterian missionary organization in Korea.[27] In addition there are many Korean-American Presbyterians in the United States, either with their own church sites or sharing space in pre-existing churches as is the case in Australia, New Zealand and even Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia with Korean immigration.\\r\\nThe Korean Presbyterian Church started through the mission of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Australian Presbyterian theological tradition is central to the United States. But after independence, the 'Presbyterian Church in Korea (KoRyuPa)' advocated a Dutch Reformed position. In the 21st century, a new General Assembly of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church of Korea (Founder. Ha Seung-moo) in 2012 declared itself an authentic historical succession of Scottish Presbyterian John Knox.\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church in Taiwan (PCT) is by far the largest Protestant denomination in Taiwan, with some 238,372 members as of 2009 (including a majority of the island's aborigines). English Presbyterian missionary James Laidlaw Maxwell established the first Presbyterian church in Tainan in 1865. His colleague George Leslie Mackay, of the Canadian Presbyterian Mission, was active in Danshui and north Taiwan from 1872 to 1901; he founded the island's first university and hospital, and created a written script for Taiwanese Minnan. The English and Canadian missions joined together as the PCT in 1912. One of the few churches permitted to operate in Taiwan through the era of Japanese rule (1895ÿ1945), the PCT experienced rapid growth during the era of Guomindang-imposed martial law (1949ÿ1987), in part due to its support for democracy, human rights, and Taiwan independence. Former ROC president Lee Teng-hui (in office 1988ÿ2000) is a Presbyterian.\\r\\nIn the mainly Christian Indian state of Mizoram, the Presbyterian denomination is the largest denomination; it was brought to the region with missionaries from Wales in 1894. Prior to Mizoram, the Welsh Presbyterians (missionaries) started venturing into the north-east of India through the Khasi Hills (presently located within the state of Meghalaya in India) and established Presbyterian churches all over the Khasi Hills from the 1840s onwards. Hence there is a strong presence of Presbyterians in Shillong (the present capital of Meghalaya) and the areas adjoining it. The Welsh missionaries built their first church in Sohra (aka Cherrapunji) in 1846. Presbyterians participated in the mergers that resulted in the Church of North India and the Church of South India.\\r\\nIn Australia, Presbyterianism is the fourth largest denomination of Christianity, with nearly 600,000 Australians claiming to be Presbyterian in the 2006 Commonwealth Census. Presbyterian churches were founded in each colony, some with links to the Church of Scotland and others to the Free Church. There were also congregations originating from United Presbyterian Church of Scotland as well as a number founded by John Dunmore Lang. Most of these bodies merged between 1859 and 1870, and in 1901 formed a federal union called the Presbyterian Church of Australia but retaining their state assemblies. The Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia representing the Free Church of Scotland tradition, and congregations in Victoria of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, originally from Ireland, are the other existing denominations dating from colonial times.\\r\\nIn 1977, two thirds of the Presbyterian Church of Australia, along with most of the Congregational Union of Australia and all the Methodist Church of Australasia, combined to form the Uniting Church in Australia. The third who did not unite had various reasons for so acting, often cultural attachment but often conservative theological or social views. The permission for the ordination of women given in 1974 was rescinded in 1991 without affecting the two or three existing woman ministers. The approval of women elders given in the 1960s has been rescinded in all states except New South Wales, which has the largest membership. The theology of the church is now generally conservative and Reformed. A number of small Presbyterian denominations have arisen since the 1950s through migration or schism.\\r\\nIn New Zealand, Presbyterian is the dominant denomination in Otago and Southland due largely to the rich Scottish and to a lesser extent Ulster-Scots heritage in the region. The area around Christchurch, Canterbury, is dominated philosophically by the Anglican (Episcopalian) denomination.\\r\\nOriginally there were two branches of Presbyterianism in New Zealand, the northern Presbyterian church which existed in the North Island and the parts of the South Island north of the Waitaki River, and the Synod of Otago and Southland, founded by Free Church settlers in southern South Island. The two churches merged in 1901, forming what is now the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand.\\r\\nIn addition to the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand, there is also a more conservative Presbyterian church called Grace Presbyterian Church of New Zealand. Many of its members left the largely liberal PCANZ because they were seeking a more Biblical church. It has 17 churches throughout New Zealand.\\r\\nThe Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu is the largest denomination in the country, with approximately one-third of the population of Vanuatu members of the church. The PCV was taken to Vanuatu by missionaries from Scotland. The PCV (Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu) is headed by a moderator with offices in Port Vila. The PCV is particularly strong in the provinces of Tafea, Shefa, and Malampa. The Province of Sanma is mainly Presbyterian with a strong Roman Catholic minority in the Francophone areas of the province. There are some Presbyterian people, but no organised Presbyterian churches in Penama and Torba, both of which are traditionally Anglican. Vanuatu is the only country in the South Pacific with a significant Presbyterian heritage and membership. The PCV is a founding member of the Vanuatu Christian Council (VCC). The PCV runs many primary schools and Onesua secondary school. The church is strong in the rural villages.","input":"Who was the founder of the presbyterian church?"},{"output":"negotiation","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR; known in some countries, such as India,[1] as external dispute resolution) includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation. It is a collective term for the ways that parties can settle disputes, with the help of a third party.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite historic resistance to ADR by many popular parties and their advocates, ADR has gained widespread acceptance among both the general public and the legal profession in recent years. In fact, some courts now require some parties to resort to ADR of some type, usually mediation, before permitting the parties' cases to be tried (indeed the European Mediation Directive (2008) expressly contemplates so-called \\"compulsory\\" mediation; this means that attendance is compulsory, not that settlement must be reached through mediation). Additionally, parties to merger and acquisition transactions are increasingly turning to ADR to resolve post-acquisition disputes.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rising popularity of ADR can be explained by the increasing caseload of traditional courts, the perception that ADR imposes fewer costs than litigation, a preference for confidentiality, and the desire of some parties to have greater control over the selection of the individual or individuals who will decide their dispute.[3] Some of the senior judiciary in certain jurisdictions (of which England and Wales is one) are strongly in favour of this (ADR) use of mediation to settle disputes.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternative dispute resolution (ADR) is generally classified into at least four types: negotiation, mediation, collaborative law, and arbitration. Sometimes, conciliation is included as a fifth category, but for simplicity may be regarded as a form of mediation. ADR can be used alongside existing legal systems such as Sharia courts within common law jurisdictions, such as the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nADR traditions vary somewhat by country and culture.  There are significant common elements which justify a main topic, and each country or region's difference should be delegated to sub-pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nADR is of two historic types.  First, methods for resolving disputes outside of the official judicial mechanisms.  Second, informal methods attached to or pendant to official judicial mechanisms. There are in addition free-standing and or independent methods, such as mediation programs and ombuds offices within organizations.  The methods are similar, whether or not they are pendant, and generally use similar tool or skill sets, which are basically sub-sets of the skills of negotiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nADR includes informal tribunals, informal mediative processes, formal tribunals and formal mediative processes.  The classic formal tribunal forms of ADR are arbitration (both binding and advisory or non-binding) and private judges (either sitting alone, on panels or over summary jury trials). The classic formal mediative process is referral for mediation before a court-appointed mediator or mediation panel. Structured transformative mediation as used by the U.S. Postal Service is a formal process. Classic informal methods include social processes, referrals to non-formal authorities (such as a respected member of a trade or social group) and intercession.  The major differences between formal and informal processes are (a) pendency to a court procedure and (b) the possession or lack of a formal structure for the application of the procedure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, freeform negotiation is merely the use of the tools without any process.  Negotiation within a labor arbitration setting is the use of the tools within a highly formalized and controlled setting.\\r\\n\\r\\nCalling upon an organizational ombudsman's office is never, by itself, a formal procedure. (Calling upon an organizational ombudsman is always voluntary; by the International Ombudsman Association Standards of Practice, no one can be compelled to use an ombuds office.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizational ombuds offices refer people to all conflict management options in the organization: formal and informal, rights-based and interest-based. But, in addition, in part because they have no decision-making authority, ombuds offices can, themselves, offer a wide spectrum of informal options.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis spectrum is often overlooked in contemporary discussions of \\"ADR\\". \\"ADR\\" often refers to external conflict management options that are important, but used only occasionally. An organizational ombuds office typically offers many internal options that are used in hundreds of cases a year. These options include:\\r\\n\\r\\nInformal referral to a co-worker known to help people work out issues is an informal procedure. Co-worker interventions are usually informal.\\r\\n\\r\\nConceptualizing ADR in this way makes it easy to avoid confusing tools and methods (does negotiation once a lawsuit is filed cease to be ADR?  If it is a tool, then the question is the wrong question) (is mediation ADR unless a court orders it?  If you look at court orders and similar things as formalism, then the answer is clear: court annexed mediation is merely a formal ADR process).\\r\\n\\r\\nDividing lines in ADR processes are often provider driven rather than consumer driven. Educated consumers will often choose to use many different options depending on the needs and circumstances that they face.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, it is important to realize that conflict resolution is one major goal of all the ADR processes.  If a process leads to resolution, it is a dispute resolution process.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salient features of each type are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the basic types of alternative dispute resolutions there are other different forms of ADR:\\r\\n\\r\\nAn organizational ombudsman works within the institution to look into complaints independently and impartially.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Alternative\\" dispute resolution is usually considered to be alternative to litigation. It also can be used as a colloquialism for allowing a dispute to drop or as an alternative to violence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years there has been more discussion about taking a systems approach in order to offer different kinds of options to people who are in conflict, and to foster \\"appropriate\\" dispute resolution.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is, some cases and some complaints in fact ought to go to formal grievance or to court or to the police or to a compliance officer or to a government IG. Other conflicts could be settled by the parties if they had enough support and coaching, and yet other cases need mediation or arbitration. Thus \\"alternative\\" dispute resolution usually means a method that is not the courts. \\"Appropriate\\" dispute resolution considers all the possible responsible options for conflict resolution that are relevant for a given issue.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nADR can increasingly be conducted online, which is known as online dispute resolution (ODR, which is mostly a buzzword and an attempt to create a distinctive product). It should be noted, however, that ODR services can be provided by government entities, and as such may form part of the litigation process. Moreover, they can be provided on a global scale, where no effective domestic remedies are available to disputing parties, as in the case of the UDRP and domain name disputes. In this respect, ODR might not satisfy the \\"alternative\\" element of ADR.\\r\\n\\r\\nADR has several advantages over litigation:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, ADR less suitable than litigation when there is:\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional people's mediation has always involved the parties remaining in contact for most or all of the mediation session. The innovation of separating the parties after (or sometimes before) a joint session and conducting the rest of the process without the parties in the same area was a major innovation and one that dramatically improved mediation's success rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditional arbitration involved heads of trade guilds or other dominant authorities settling disputes. The modern innovation was to have commercial vendors of arbitrators, often ones with little or no social or political dominance over the parties. The advantage was that such persons are much more readily available. The disadvantage is that it does not involve the community of the parties. When wool contract arbitration was conducted by senior guild officials, the arbitrator combined a seasoned expert on the subject matter with a socially dominant individual whose patronage, good will and opinion were important.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate judges and summary jury trials are cost- and time-saving processes that have had limited penetration due to the alternatives becoming more robust and accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomalia-----\\r\\n\\r\\nSomalia has cultural and historic mediation and justice system known as ADR Alternative Dispute Resolution  which is informal justice system.\\r\\nis a kind of justice system which the arbiter makes to listen both side of dispute and them concludes the solution and both side will accept that decision of the mediator person.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhmed Mohamed Abdullahi.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin has a number of terms for mediator that predate the Roman Empire. Any time there are formal adjudicative processes it appears that there are informal ones as well. It is probably fruitless to attempt to determine which group had mediation first.\\r\\n\\r\\nNjls saga is an Icelandic story of a mediator who was so successful that he eventually threatened the local power structure. It ends in tragedy with the unlawful burning of Njal alive in his home, the escape of a friend of the family, a mini-war and the eventual ending of the dispute by the intermarriage of the two strongest survivors. It illustrates that mediation was a powerful process in Iceland.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternative dispute resolution in India is not new and it was in existence even under the previous Arbitration Act, 1940. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has been enacted to accommodate the harmonisation mandates of UNCITRAL Model. To streamline the Indian legal system the traditional civil law known as Code of Civil Procedure, (CPC) 1908 has also been amended and section 89 has been introduced. Section 89 (1) of CPC provides an option for the settlement of disputes outside the court. It provides that where it appears to the court that there exist elements, which may be acceptable to the parties, the court may formulate the terms of a possible settlement and refer the same for arbitration, conciliation, mediation or judicial settlement.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to extremely slow judicial process, there has been a big thrust on Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanisms in India. While Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a fairly standard western approach towards ADR, the Lok Adalat system constituted under National Legal Services Authority Act, 1987 is a uniquely Indian approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study on commercial dispute resolution in south India has been done by a think tank organization based in Kochi, Centre for Public Policy Research. The study reveals that the Court-annexed Mediation Centre in Bangalore has a success rate of 64%, and its counterpart in Kerala has an average success rate of 27.7%. Further, amongst the three southern states (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala), Tamil Nadu is said to have the highest adoption of dispute resolution, Kerala the least.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPart I of this act formalizes the process of Arbitration and Part III formalizes the process of Conciliation. (Part II is about Enforcement of Foreign Awards under New York and Geneva Conventions.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process of arbitration can start only if there exists a valid Arbitration Agreement between the parties prior to the emergence of the dispute. As per Section 7, such an agreement must be in writing. The contract regarding which the dispute exists, must either contain an arbitration clause or must refer to a separate document signed by the parties containing the arbitration agreement. The existence of an arbitration agreement can also be inferred by written correspondence such as letters, telex, or telegrams which provide a record of the agreement. An exchange of statement of claim and defense in which existence of an arbitration agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by other is also considered as valid written arbitration agreement.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny party to the dispute can start the process of appointing arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator. There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment of an arbitrator ÿ reasonable doubt in the impartiality of the arbitrator and the lack of proper qualification of the arbitrator as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.\\r\\n\\r\\nExcept for some interim measures, there is very little scope for judicial intervention in the arbitration process. The arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over its own jurisdiction. Thus, if a party wants to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitration tribunal, it can do so only before the tribunal itself. If the tribunal rejects the request, there is little the party can do except to approach a court after the tribunal makes an award. Section 34 provides certain grounds upon which a party can appeal to the principal civil court of original jurisdiction for setting aside the award.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe period for filing an appeal for setting aside an award is over, or if such an appeal is rejected, the award is binding on the parties and is considered as a decree of the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nConciliation is a less formal form of arbitration. This process does not require an existence of any prior agreement. Any party can request the other party to appoint a conciliator. One conciliator is preferred but two or three are also allowed. In case of multiple conciliators, all must act jointly. If a party rejects an offer to conciliate, there can be no conciliation.\\r\\n\\r\\nParties may submit statements to the conciliator describing the general nature of the dispute and the points at issue. Each party sends a copy of the statement to the other. The conciliator may request further details, may ask to meet the parties, or communicate with the parties orally or in writing. Parties may even submit suggestions for the settlement of the dispute to the conciliator.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen it appears to the conciliator that elements of settlement exist, he may draw up the terms of settlement and send it to the parties for their acceptance. If both the parties sign the settlement document, it shall be final and binding on both.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that in the US, this process is similar to mediation. However, in India, mediation is different from conciliation and is a completely informal type of ADR mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\nEtymologically, Lok Adalat means \\"people's court\\". India has had a long history of resolving disputes through the mediation of village elders. The current system of Lok Adalats is an improvement on that and is based on Gandhian principles. This is a non-adversarial system, whereby mock courts (called Lok Adalats) are held by the State Authority, District Authority, Supreme Court Legal Services Committee, High Court Legal Services Committee, or Taluk Legal Services Committee, periodically for exercising such jurisdiction as they thinks fit. These are usually presided by retired judge, social activists, or members of legal profession. It does not have jurisdiction on matters related to non-compoundable offences.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile in regular suits, the plaintiff is required to pay the prescribed court fee, in Lok Adalat, there is no court fee and no rigid procedural requirement (i.e. no need to follow process given by [Indian] Civil Procedure Code or Indian Evidence Act), which makes the process very fast. Parties can directly interact with the judge, which is not possible in regular courts.\\r\\n\\r\\nCases that are pending in regular courts can be transferred to a Lok Adalat if both the parties agree. A case can also be transferred to a Lok Adalat if one party applies to the court and the court sees some chance of settlement after giving an opportunity of being heard to the other party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe focus in Lok Adalats is on compromise. When no compromise is reached, the matter goes back to the court. However, if a compromise is reached, an award is made and is binding on the parties. It is enforced as a decree of a civil court. An important aspect is that the award is final and cannot be appealed, not even under Article 226 of the Constitution of India [which empowers the litigants to file Writ Petition before High Courts] because it is a judgement by consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll proceedings of a Lok Adalat are deemed to be judicial proceedings and every Lok Adalat is deemed to be a Civil Court.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to get over the major drawback in the existing scheme of organisation of Lok Adalats under Chapter VI of the Legal Services Authorities Act 1987, in which if the parties do not arrive at any compromise or settlement, the unsettled case is either returned to the back to the court or the parties are advised to seek remedy in a court of law, which causes unnecessary delay in dispensation of justice, Chapter VI A was introduced in the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, by Act No.37/2002 with effect from 11-06-2002 providing for a Permanent Lok Adalat to deal with pre-litigation, conciliation and settlement of disputes relating to Public Utility Services, as defined u/sec.22 A of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, at pre-litigation stage itself, which would result in reducing the work load of the regular courts to a great extent. Permanent Lok Adalat for Public Utility Services, Hyderabad, India\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lok Adalat is presided over by a sitting or retired judicial officer as the chairman, with two other members, usually a lawyer and a social worker. There is no court fee. If the case is already filed in the regular court, the fee paid will be refunded if the dispute is settled at the Lok Adalat. The procedural laws, and the Evidence Act are not strictly followed while assessing the merits of the claim by the Lok Adalat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMain condition of the Lok Adalat is that both parties in dispute should agree for settlement. The decision of the Lok Adalat is binding on the parties to the dispute and its order is capable of execution through legal process. No appeal lies against the order of the Lok Adalat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLok Adalat is very effective in settlement of money claims. Disputes like partition suits, damages and matrimonial cases can also be easily settled before Lok Adalat as the scope for compromise through an approach of give and take is high in these cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nLok Adalat is a boon to the litigant public, where they can get their disputes settled fast and free of cost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe relevant laws (or parlour provisions) dealing with the ADR are summarised as under:\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore modern state law was introduced under colonialism, African customary legal systems mainly relied on mediation and conciliation. In many countries, these traditional mechanisms have been integrated into the official legal system. In Benin, specialised tribunaux de conciliation hear cases on a broad range of civil law matters. Results are then transmitted to the court of first instance where either a successful conciliation is confirmed or jurisdiction is assumed by the higher court. Similar tribunals also operate, in varying modes, in other francophone African countries.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, ADR is encouraged as a mean of resolving taxpayers' disputes with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the regulated sectors, finance, telecoms and energy ADR providers exist. Outside of the regulated areas there are schemes in many sectors which provide schemes for voluntary membership. Two sets of regulations, in March and June 2015, were laid in Parliament to implement the European Directive on alternative dispute resolution in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nSECNAVINST 5800.13A established the DON ADR Program Office with the following missions:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ADR Office also serves as the point of contact for questions regarding the use of ADR.

After the pilot was rejected by NBC as being \\"too cerebral\\" (among other complaints),[20] Jeffrey Hunter chose to withdraw from the role of Pike[21] when creator Gene Roddenberry was asked to produce a second pilot episode (\\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\") of which an edited version of the same name aired in 1966.[22][23]\\r\\n\\"The Cage\\" never aired during Star Trek's original run on NBC. It was presented by Roddenberry as a black-and-white workprint at various science fiction conventions over the years after Star Trek's cancellation but was not released on home video until 1986 when Paramount Home Video produced a \\"restored\\" release of \\"The Cage\\" (a combination of the original black-and-white footage and color portions of the Season 1 episode \\"The Menagerie\\") complete with an introduction by Gene Roddenberry.[24]\\r\\nOn October 4, 1988, Paramount Pictures aired a two-hour television special, hosted by Patrick Stewart, called The Star Trek Saga: From One Generation to the Next, which featured, for the first time, a full-color television presentation of \\"The Cage\\". In some markets, the special did not air until October 15, 1988.[24] In the United States, \\"The Cage\\" was first released to DVD in December 2001.[25] It was later included on the final disc in both the original and \\"remastered\\" Season 3 DVD box sets (listed with the original air date of October 15, 1988).[5][8][26]\\r\\nThe also planned-as-pilot \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" in its original form (production number 02a) had been forwarded to NBC, but only a re-worked, re-edited, re-formatted, cut version was later aired under the same name, not as a pilot but as the third episode of the series (production number 02b). Afterwards, over the years the original \\"alternate\\" version was thought to be lost but later appeared as bootleg VHS tapes at conventions, until a print of it was discovered in 2009 and subsequently released on home video under the title \\"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\\" - The Restored, Unaired Alternate Pilot Episode as part of the TOS season 3 box set on Blu-ray;[27] it has not been released on DVD yet. This version remains unaired.\\r\\nAfter Roddenberry's second pilot episode, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", received a more favorable response from NBC,[22][23] Star Trek finally aired its first episode\\"The Man Trap\\"at 8:30PM on September 8, 1966.[29] \\"Where No Man...\\", which eventually aired in a re-edited format as the series' third episode, retained only Spock as a character from \\"The Cage\\" but introduced William Shatner as Captain Kirk, James Doohan as chief engineer Scotty, and George Takei as physicist (later helmsman) Sulu. Also joining the cast were DeForest Kelley as ship's surgeon and Nichelle Nichols as the communications officer Uhura in \\"The Man Trap\\"; the first aired episode of the series.\\r\\nAlthough her character of Number One was not retained from \\"The Cage\\", Majel Barrett returned to the show as a new character, nurse Christine Chapel, and made her first of many recurring appearances in \\"The Naked Time\\". Grace Lee Whitney appeared in eight episodes as yeoman Janice Rand, beginning with \\"The Man Trap\\". Whitney left the series after \\"The Conscience of the King\\",[22][30][31] but would later make minor appearances in the first, third, fourth, and sixth Trek films as well as one episode of the companion series Star Trek: Voyager.\\r\\nStar Trek's first season comprised 29 episodes, including the two-part episode \\"The Menagerie\\", which includes much of the footage from the original pilot, \\"The Cage\\". Other notable episodes include \\"Balance of Terror\\", which introduces the Romulans; \\"Space Seed\\", which introduces Khan Noonien Singh and serves as the basis for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan; \\"Errand of Mercy\\", in which the Klingons make their first appearance; and the critically acclaimed,[32] Hugo-Award-winning episode[33] \\"The City on the Edge of Forever\\", which features Kirk, Spock, and McCoy traveling into the past through the Guardian of Forever.\\r\\nThe show's 26-episode second season began in September 1967[2] with \\"Amok Time\\", which introduced actor Walter Koenig as Russian navigator Pavel Chekov, and granted viewers the first glimpse of Spock's homeworld, Vulcan. The season also includes such notable episodes as \\"Mirror, Mirror\\", which introduces the evil \\"mirror universe\\"; \\"Journey to Babel\\", featuring the introduction of Spock's parents Sarek and Amanda; and the light-hearted \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", which would later be revisited in a 1973 episode of Star Trek: The Animated Series and a 1996 episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. The season ended with Assignment: Earth, an attempt to launch a spin-off television series set in the (then) present day.\\r\\nAfter Star Trek's second season, NBC was prepared to cancel the show due to low ratings.[34][35] Led by fans Bjo and John Trimble, Trek viewers inundated NBC with letters protesting the show's demise and pleading the network to renew the series for another year.[35][36] After NBC agreed to produce a third season, the network promised Gene Roddenberry that the show would air in a favorable timeslot (Mondays at 7:30 PM),[34][35] but later changed the schedule so that Trek would air in the so-called \\"death slot\\"? Friday nights at 10:00PM.[34][37] In addition to the \\"mismanaged\\"[35] schedule, the show's budget was \\"seriously slashed\\"[34] and Nichelle Nichols described the series' eventual cancellation as \\"a self-fulfilling prophecy\\".[38]\\r\\nStar Trek's final, 24-episode season began in September 1968 with \\"Spock's Brain\\".[2] The third season also includes \\"The Tholian Web\\", where Kirk becomes trapped between universes; this episode would later be revisited by two 2005 episodes of the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise. The last episode of the series, \\"Turnabout Intruder\\", aired on June 3, 1969,[2] but Star Trek would eventually return to television in animated form when the animated Star Trek debuted in September 1973.\\r\\nThe list below details the series' episodes in production order, including the original series pilot, \\"The Cage\\". While the \\"complete season\\" DVD releases (listed above) follow the original broadcast order, the original episodic DVD releases[10] are numbered by production order.[39]\\r\\nStar Trek was first broadcast in the UK on BBC One starting on July 12, 1969 with the episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\". The first episode broadcast in color was \\"Arena\\" on November 15, 1969. The running order was very different from the US original with the episodes being shown in four seasons between 1969 and 1971. The Cage was first transmitted on Sky One in July 1990 and three episodes, \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\", \\"The Empath\\" and \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\" were not broadcast on the BBC until early 1994. Sky One were the first to show them in their run that started in 1990 (though Sky were supplied with the BBC edited versions of the series) and tellingly the three \\"banned\\" episodes were the only ones that had the opening titles in the right place, having never been shown by the BBC although \\"The Empath\\" is listed for transmission on Wednesday December 16, 1970 at 7.20pm in the Radio Times.[40]\\r\\nThe BBC broadcast versions of the episodes differed from the way they had been shown in America. The opening elements of each episode were transposed so that the title sequence was the first thing seen, followed by the teaser, and then into the rest of the episode without a pause. These prints were used up until the 1990s but for their new run the BBC were supplied with NTSC tape transfers instead of new film prints. This resulted in the odd blurry appearance that viewers were getting used to on new US shows at the time. Season one was shown and at least some episodes had edits that matched the syndication cuts of the US episodes \\"The Menagerie\\" Part 1 for instance. Viewers complained and the BBC obtained film prints from season two, although for some reason the old edited version of \\"The Deadly Years\\" was shown in the first '90s repeat.","input":"When did star trek first air in the uk?"},{"output":"Regis Philbin","context":"Live with Kelly and Ryan is an American syndicated morning talk show, hosted by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest. Executive produced by Michael Gelman, the Live with... show formula has aired under various hosts since 1983 locally on WABC-TV in New York City and 1988 nationwide. As of 2016, it is produced by WABC.[1]\\r\\nWith roots in A.M. Los Angeles and A.M. New York, Live began as The Morning Show, hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey; the show rose to national prominence as Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, when Philbin was joined by Kathie Lee Gifford. That incarnation of the program ran for 12 years and continuing as Live with Regis and Kelly for another decade before Ripa, after hosting with guest co-hosts for nearly a year, was paired with former NFL star Michael Strahan. The franchise has had longstanding success and has won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show and Outstanding Talk Show Hosts.[2] On January 19, 2016, the show was renewed through the 2019ÿ20 season. On February 12, 2016, a special episode focused on Ripa's 15 years as part of the program. On April 18, 2016, Strahan and ABC announced that he was leaving the show to join ABC's Good Morning America full-time. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest will join Ripa as her new permanent co-host, succeeding Strahan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive producer Michael Gelman said in 1993, \\"The real concept of the show, in a symbolic sense, is that they are husband and wife. They have their coffee mugs and they're chit-chatting about what's going on.\\" That is the basis of the show's signature \\"Host Chat\\", an unscripted on-air conversation between the co-hosts that opens each show. Then, a home viewer is called to answer a trivia question about the show, with the opportunity to win a vacation. The show then continues with interviews with celebrity guests, musical performances, and other recurring segments, including regular features showcasing fashion, food, health, and lifestyle topics.[3]\\r\\nThe format of Live! has been emulated by other successful talk shows such as the British programmes Richard & Judy and Today with Des and Mel. However, it has also proven to be resilient against similarly-formatted talk shows from other syndicators or networks, seeing programs such as Mike and Maty, George & Alana, Caryl & Marilyn: Real Friends, Donny & Marie, Living It Up! With Ali & Jack, The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet, and Anderson Live all launch and end in short periods of time throughout its entire run, and fail to make any headway in the traditional 9 a.m. local time slot Live! has been traditionally slotted in for most markets.\\r\\nThe show is broadcast live from New York City, on weekdays at 9?a.m. for stations in the Eastern Time Zone, and is tape-delayed for the rest of the country. Although the program is generally associated with the ABC network and airs on all ABC owned-and-operated stations, in many markets the program is syndicated to stations affiliated with other networks.[4] Live did not air in a morning timeslot on all ABC-owned stations until September 2013, as WLS Chicago programmed the 9?a.m. timeslot with The Oprah Winfrey Show as the originating station for the program in the 1980s, then Windy City Live after the end of Oprah, while the New York-based Live had aired on The CW affiliate WGN since 2002 (although WLS had carried the show in an overnight timeslot earlier in its run).[5][6]\\r\\nGuinness World Record Breaker Week, New York Auto Show Week, Broadway Week, and Top Teacher Week are examples of features frequently visited on the show, highlighting a different aspect of the theme everyday that week. Live will also invite \\"whiz kids\\" to oppose the co-hosts at spelling, athletics, mathematics, sport stacking, and technology, among other tasks. A recurring gag with Philbin as co-host was him challenging seniorspreferably over the age of 100at tennis, basketball, ping-pong, and bowling, for example. Also, regular contributors to the show include toy enthusiast Chris Byrne, style maven Lawrence Zarian, animal expert Peter Gros, automotive expert Alan Taylor, pediatrician Greg Yapalater, home and gardening show host Katie Brown, technology specialist Leo Laporte, entrepreneur Carley Roney, Science Bob, veterinarian Jennifer Jellison, and nutrition expert Wendy Bazilian.[7]\\r\\nEvery year at Halloween, the co-hosts wear dozens of costumes and portray some of the most famous and infamous names in pop culture.[8] The 2013 special, entitled the \\"Best Halloween Show Ever,\\" had the most costume changes to date with over 50 in one hour.\\r\\nIn February, Live throws a wedding for a couple who writes in with reasons why they should be married on the show.[9] Viewer submissions are also accepted for their \\"Moms Dream Come True Special,\\" where the co-hosts pay tribute to a select group of mothers.[10]\\r\\nLive from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, the show airs its Post-Oscar Special the day after the awards ceremony.[11] The co-hosts interview winners and presenters as well as other attendees on the red carpet, backstage and live on the show. Also, a panel recaps the best and worst of fashions worn at the event.\\r\\nLive has been to eight countries and nearly 25 states, logging 200,000 miles (320,000?km).[12] The list of remotes includes: Tampa, Hawaii, Monaco, Banff, San Antonio, Aspen, Walt Disney World, New Orleans, Disneyland, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Paris, Detroit, Chicago, The Bronx, Los Angeles, the USS Intrepid, MinneapolisÿSaint Paul, Maui, Prince Edward Island, London, Scottsdale, the White House, Charlotte, Churchill Downs, Niagara Falls, Puerto Rico, Marina del Rey, Philadelphia, Branson, Mount Rushmore, The Bahamas, and the Dolby Theatre's set for the 85th Academy Awards. While on location, the co-hosts transplant the franchise's own brand of entertainment-oriented talk with the beauty of the particular location providing a colorful backdrop to the show's segments.\\r\\nThe show has part of its origins in A.M. Los Angeles, a local show that was broadcast on KABC-TV in Los Angeles from 1971 to 1981 that was originally created and hosted by Ralph Story, with Stephanie Edwards as co-host.[13] When the format went national as AM America in 1975 (taking Edwards along with it), Regis Philbin assumed hosting duties of the Los Angeles version, with Sarah Purcell as his original co-host. Purcell departed the show in 1978 and was replaced by Cyndy Garvey. Philbin and Garvey hosted A.M. Los Angeles until 1981.\\r\\nMeanwhile, there were also two different morning-show predecessors on WABC-TV in New York City. The first was A.M. New York which debuted on May 18, 1970 as a local answer to NBC's Today show,[14] and was originally hosted by John Bartholomew Tucker. After he left in 1972, a succession of hosts came and went, until Stanley Siegel took over in late 1975. Under Siegel's stint, the show went from last to first in the ratings for a brief period, and from 1977 until his departure in 1978 it was known as The Stanley Siegel Show.[15] Following Siegel's departure for rival WCBS-TV, the show reverted to the A.M. New York name until its cancellation in 1980, by which point it had been hosted by Janet Langhart and Clay Cole. A few weeks later, WABC tried again with Good Morning New York, hosted originally by Spencer Christian and Andrea Kirby; Kirby would eventually be replaced by Judy Licht, and Christian was followed by the likes of Dick Wolfsie and longtime Eyewitness News reporter and anchor Doug Johnson. Like its predecessor for much of its run, Good Morning New York failed to make a dent in the ratings against Donahue on WNBC, and was cancelled in early 1983, with The Morning Show as its replacement.[16]\\r\\nThe Morning Show, co-hosted by Regis Philbin and Cyndy Garvey, premiered locally on WABC-TV in New York on April 4, 1983. In 1984, Garvey left the show and Philbin hired Ann Abernathy, whom he remembered from his time at KABC-Television for her engaging personality, to assume the co-host duties.[17] After Abernathy got married and decided to return to Los Angeles, Kathie Lee Johnson (later Gifford) joined Philbin officially on June 24, 1985. Their chemistry proved to be successful as The Morning Show soon became number 1 in the market[18] and went on to debut in national syndication on September 5, 1988, when the title was changed to Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. \\r\\nEarly on, Live matched its local success with impressive national ratings and established itself as a dominant fixture in American television.[19] Entertainment Weekly described Regis Philbin and Kathie Lee Gifford as \\"an agreeable mismatch\\" and their famous banter as \\"playful, edgy, and amusing.\\"[20] Gifford's positivity throughout public scandals such as the 1996 accusation that her clothing line was being run under sweatshop conditions and her husband Frank Gifford's 1997 affair with a flight attendant resonated with the female demographic of the show, but ultimately made her a media target prompting her emotional departure on July 28, 2000. \\"Over a third of my life has been [at Live],\\" she said. \\"This is family. It is been an amazing journey.\\"[17] Gifford appeared on Live! with Regis and Kelly on three occasions, for the show is 20th Anniversary special on September 14, 2007, to promote her book Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg: Life and Other Calamities on April 14, 2009, and again as a guest to bid farewell to Philbin on his second to last show, November 17, 2011. Gifford is now host of the live fourth hour of Today with Hoda Kotb; that show mainly airs an hour after Live! in most markets, though a few markets where both shows air at 10:00 a.m. against each other do exist.\\r\\nWhen looking for Gifford's replacement, Philbin and executive producer Michael Gelman teamed Philbin with a handful of potential co-hosts, including Joy Philbin, Kathleen Murphy, Rosie O'Donnell, Jann Carl, Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Fountain, Gloria Estefan, Jillian Reynolds, Caroline Rhea and Suzanne Sena. This met with positive fan response and a 26 percent ratings increase.[21] Philbin won his first Daytime Emmy Award for Live during the six-month period, which he would go on to win twice with co-host Kelly Ripa. Ripa had auditioned four months into the search, on November 1, 2000.[22] Ripa was announced as the official replacement on February 5, 2001.[citation needed]\\r\\nLive! with Regis and Kelly's young-audience demographics increased by 80 percent, with Ripa credited[by whom?] for bringing \\"a new life to the show.\\" Seven months into Philbin and Ripa's run, the September 11 attacks on New York occurred, with coverage beginning twelve minutes before that day is episode would have started. The show was pre-empted for a week following the attacks and returned September 18, 2001, with Philbin opening the episode saying:\\r\\nThe last time we saw you was a week ago this morning when our lives seemed normal... then the unthinkable happened. Just then, our worst nightmare occurred, a second plane slammed into the South Tower. Now it was clear. This was a terrible act of terrorism. Then came the news that the Pentagon was hit and another hijacked plane crashed in Pennsylvania killing everybody on board. Today, the heroic effort continues and the death toll rises. But amid the despair, we continue to hope for signs of life beneath the debris. Exhausted rescue workers refuse to give up. Our nation has never been more united. Across the country, Americans are pulling together and everywhere you look, there are tremendous shows of support, patriotism, and faith. Terrorists tried to tear us apart but they failed. Instead, we as a nation have become stronger and have only been brought closer together.[23]\\r\\nShortly after celebrating his and Ripa's 10th anniversary together, Philbin announced on January 18, 2011 that he would leave Live!.[24] The show then held a \\"Regis Farewell Celebration Season\\", showcasing Philbin's top moments from 28 years on the program.[25] His final show aired November 18, 2011.[26]\\r\\nAfter Philbin's departure, the show was renamed Live! with Kelly. Joining Ripa were various co-hosts from broadcasting and entertainment. On November 21, 2011, Jerry Seinfeld was the first of 60[27] men and women to join Ripa at the co-host desk, including: Reggie Bush, Kyle MacLachlan, Russell Brand, Howie Mandel, Carl Edwards, Chris Harrison, Daniel Radcliffe, Michael Buckley, Michael Catherwood, Rob Lowe, Martin Short, Neil Patrick Harris, Peter Facinelli, Boomer Esiason, Ben Mulroney, Dan Abrams, Rob Thomas, David Duchovny, Pat Kiernan, Derek Hough, D.

Reid, Bryant Gumbel, Daniel Dae Kim and Sam Champion.[28]\\r\\nIn April 2012, Live! debuted a new set described as a \\"contemporary downtown-style loft, spacious and yet maintaining the studio's warmth and intimacy.\\"[29] It was the first major set re-design since the start of the show's 10th season in national syndication (1997ÿ98).\\r\\nIn July 2012, People magazine reported that Meyers, Groban and Strahan were the top three contenders in the running to replace Philbin.[30]\\r\\nOn the September 4, 2012 episode, Michael Strahan made his 16th appearance on the show and was introduced as Ripas permanent co-host. The former New York Giants defensive end had begun his TV career on Fox NFL Sunday, a job he said he would keep even though it shoots in Los Angeles. The Ripa-Strahan chemistry proved to be successful. Live With Kelly & Michael had been the No. 2 syndicated talk show averaging a 2.8 national rating over Strahans entire tenure while Live With Regis & Kelly averaged a 2.6. Live With Kelly & Michael brought in 268,000 more audience members daily, on average, than the show attracted during the end of the Regis run.[31] On January 19, 2016, the show was renewed through at least the 2019ÿ2020 season.[32]\\r\\nOn April 19, 2016, it was announced that Strahan would leave Live to join Good Morning America full-time.[33] The decision was revealed to the program's production staff just after that day's broadcast of Live, and officially announced on the program by Strahan the following day. Ripa, however, was absent from that day's episode, and ABC announced later in the day that Live would have guest co-hosts through April 25, 2016. Although speculated to have been a reaction to Strahan's abrupt exit, an ABC staff member stated to Variety that Ripa's sudden absence was a \\"pre-scheduled vacation\\".[34]\\r\\nRipa returned on April 26, 2016, using the opening of the episode to address the reception to Strahan's exit, and ABC's continued commitment to Live as a series.[35] Strahan's final episode on Live occurred on May 13, 2016 and featured several flashback moments from the four years that he co-hosted the show.\\r\\nOn Monday, May 16, 2016, Ripa began the second era of her Live career as a single co-host. Jimmy Kimmel joined her as her first guest co-host. A total of 67 men and women joined Ripa in the search, including, Jussie Smollett, Cedric the Entertainer, David Muir, Daniel Dae Kim,[36][37] Fred Savage, Seal, Andy Cohen, Common, Anderson Cooper, Mark Consuelos, D.L.

[38]\\r\\nOn May 1, 2017, it was announced that Ryan Seacrest would succeed Strahan as the new permanent co-host, after a year long syndicated co-host search. Seacrest will also join as an executive producer to the show.[39][40]\\r\\nOn September 5, 2017, Live with Kelly and Ryan updated the show is look, with a new, modern logo, modifications to the studio, and a brand new show open.\\r\\nThe New York Daily News gave the program a positive review, \\"  When it comes to the amount and playfulness of morning talk, nothing beats Live\\".[41] In 2001, 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2016 the show won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Hosts and in its 24th year, after twenty-one nominations, it won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show. In addition, its co-hosts have received two TV Guide Award nominations for Favorite Daytime Talk Show and multiple People's Choice nominations for Favorite Talk Show Host.\\r\\nAccording to daytime television ratings, viewership averages 5 million per episode,[42] ranking number 1 in all big markets, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Miami, West Palm Beach, and many others.

A detailed assessment of the issues has, however, convinced us that the arguments in favour of a contribution to tuition costs from graduates in work are strong, if not widely appreciated. They relate to equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part-time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income that can be ring-fenced for higher education.\\r\\n\\r\\n20.41 We have, therefore, analysed the implications of a range of options against the criteria set out in paragraph 20.2. There is a wide array of options from which to choose, ranging from asking graduates to contribute only to their living costs through to asking all graduates to contribute to their tuition costs. We have chosen to examine four options in depth\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the findings, the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998 was published on 26 November 1997, and enacted on 16 July 1998, part of which introduced tuition fees in all the countries of the United Kingdom.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe act introduced a means-tested method of payment for students based on the amount of money their families earned.[8] Starting with 1999ÿ2000, maintenance grants for living expenses would also be replaced with loans and paid back at a rate of 9% of a graduate's income above S10,000.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing devolution in 1999, the newly devolved governments in Scotland and Wales brought in their own acts on tuition fees. The Scottish Parliament established, and later abolished a graduate endowment to replace the fees.[9] Wales introduced maintenance grants of up to S1,500 in 2002, a value which has since risen to over S5000.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, tuition fee caps rose with the Higher Education Act 2004. Under the Act, universities in England could begin to charge variable fees of up to S3,000 a year for students enrolling on courses as from the academic year of 2006ÿ07 or later. This was also introduced in Northern Ireland in 2006ÿ07 and introduced in Wales in 2007ÿ08. In 2009ÿ10 the cap rose to S3,225 a year to take account of inflation.[11] Following the Browne Review in 2010, the cap was controversially raised to S9,000 a year, sparking large student protests in London.\\r\\n\\r\\nA judicial review against the raised fees failed in 2012, and so the new fee system came into use that September.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents pay interest on loans. In 2012 this rate was set at the retail price index (RPI) plus 3%. Students who started university between 1998 and 2011 pay Bank of England base rate plus 1%. Students who started university before 1998 pay interest set at the RPI rate. As a consequence of the 2012 change, students who graduate in 2017 will pay 6.1% interest, despite the Bank of England base rate being 0.25%.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther adjustments were put forth in the 2015 budget, with a proposed fee increase in line with inflation from the 2017ÿ18 academic year onwards, and the planned scrapping of maintenance grants from September 2016.[14] The changes were debated by the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in January 2016, rather than in the Commons. The lack of a vote on the matter has drawn criticism, as by circumventing the Commons the measures \\"automatically become law\\".[15] Tuition fees and perceptions about them are directly linked to satisfaction.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, tuition fees are capped at S9,250 a year for UK and EU students, with around 76% of all institutions charging the full amount in 2015ÿ16.[19] A loan of the same size is available for most universities, although students of private institutions are only eligible for S6,000 a year loans.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2017ÿ18 onwards, the S9,000 fee cap will rise with inflation. Maintenance grants are also available to current students in England, although these are scheduled to cease with the 2016ÿ17 academic year.[15] Maintenance loans are available for living costs, and these are means tested. These loans are scheduled to increase in size for 2016ÿ17, when the maintenance grant system is phased out.[20] There will be a vote in the autumn to consider a further increase effective with the 2017ÿ18 year. Several universities have already advertised fees of S9,250 for the year in anticipation of such a vote passing.[21]In October 2017, the Prime Minister Theresa May announced that tuition fees would be temporarily frozen at S9,250[22]. In 2018, this temporary freeze remains in place and it is likely to be extended as a university funding review is carried out[23]. The latter, which was launched by Theresa May, is being chaired by Philip Augar[24]. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2015 spending review, the government also proposed a freeze in the repayment threshold for tuition fee loans at S21,000; a figure which was previously set to rise with average earnings. The changes, if passed, will affect all Plan 2 tuition fee loans, backdated to cover loans taken out from 2012.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany commentators suggested that the 2012 rise in tuition fees in England would put poorer students off applying to university.[27] However, the gap between rich and poor students has slightly narrowed (from 30.5% in 2010 to 29.8% in 2013) since the introduction of the higher fees.[28] This may be because universities have used tuition fees to invest in bursaries and outreach schemes.[29] In 2016, The Guardian noted that the number of disadvantaged students applying to university had increased by 72% from 2006 to 2015, a bigger rise than in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.[30] It wrote that most of the gap between richer and poorer students tends to open up between Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 4 (i.e. at secondary school), rather than when applying for university, and so the money raised from tuition fees should be spent there instead.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nA study by Murphy, Scott-Clayton, and Wyness found that the introduction of tuition fees had \\"increased funding per head, rising enrolments, and a narrowing of the participation gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students\\".[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nTuition fees are currently capped at S4,030 in Northern Ireland, with loans of the same size available from Student Finance NI.[32] Loan repayments are made when income rises above S17,335 a year, with graduates paying back a percentage of their earnings above this threshold.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nTuition is handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which does not charge fees to what it defines as \\"Young Students\\". Young Students are defined as those under 25, without children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees exist for those outside the young student definition, typically from S1,200 to S1,800 for undergraduate courses, dependent on year of application and type of qualification. Postgraduate fees can be up to S3,400.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system has been in place since 2007 when graduate endowments were abolished.[35] Labour's education spokesperson Rhona Brankin criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty.[36] Scotland has fewer disadvantaged students than England, Wales or Northern Ireland and disadvantaged students receive around S560 a year less in financial support than their counterparts in England do.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike their English counterparts, Welsh universities are able to charge up to S9,000 a year in tuition fees. However, Welsh students can apply for fee grants of up to S5,190, in addition to a S3,810 loan to cover these costs.[37] This system also applies to Welsh students who study elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been two main proposed alternative ways of funding university studies: from general taxation or by a graduate tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nTuition is paid for by general taxation in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%.[38] Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut for the rich and a tax rise for the poor' because people would be taxed to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nJeremy Corbyn, current Labour leader, has stated that he would remove tuition fees and instead fund higher education by increasing National Insurance and Corporation Tax.[40] In the long term this has been expected to cost the government about S8 billion a year.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2017 Lord Adonis, former Number 10 Policy Unit staffer and education minister largely responsible for introducing tuition fees, said that the system had become a \\"Frankenstein's monster\\" putting many students over S50,000 in debt. He argued the system should either be scrapped or fees reverted to between S1,000 and S3,000 per the initial scheme.[42][43]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 2015 Labour leadership election, Andy Burnham said that he would introduce a graduate tax to replace fees. He was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for leadership. A graduate tax has been criticised because there would be no way to recover the money from students who move to a different country, or foreign students who return home.[44]","input":"When were university fees introduced in the uk?"},{"output":"electric currents in the conductive material of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's magnetic field, also known as the geomagnetic field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65?microteslas (0.25 to 0.65?gauss).[3] Approximately, it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle at the center of the Earth. The North geomagnetic pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South geomagnetic pole is the north pole. The magnetic field is generated by electric currents due to the motion of convection currents of molten iron in the Earth's outer core driven by heat escaping from the core, a natural process called a geodynamo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the North and South magnetic poles are usually located near the geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the geomagnetic poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating geomagnetic fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors in the process of plate tectonics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe magnetosphere is the region above the ionosphere that is defined by the extent of the Earth's magnetic field in space. It extends several tens of thousands of kilometers into space, protecting the Earth from the charged particles of the solar wind and cosmic rays that would otherwise strip away the upper atmosphere, including the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field serves to deflect most of the solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.[4] One stripping mechanism is for gas to be caught in bubbles of magnetic field, which are ripped off by solar winds.[5] Calculations of the loss of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study of past magnetic field of the Earth is known as paleomagnetism.[8] The polarity of the Earth's magnetic field is recorded in igneous rocks, and reversals of the field are thus detectable as \\"stripes\\" centered on mid-ocean ridges where the sea floor is spreading, while the stability of the geomagnetic poles between reversals has allowed paleomagnetists to track the past motion of continents. Reversals also provide the basis for magnetostratigraphy, a way of dating rocks and sediments.[9] The field also magnetizes the crust, and magnetic anomalies can be used to search for deposits of metal ores.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nHumans have used compasses for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for navigation since the 12th century.[11] Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for navigation. Using magnetoreception various other organisms, ranging from some types of bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and navigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any location, the Earth's magnetic field can be represented by a three-dimensional vector. A typical procedure for measuring its direction is to use a compass to determine the direction of magnetic North. Its angle relative to true North is the declination (D) or variation. Facing magnetic North, the angle the field makes with the horizontal is the inclination (I) or magnetic dip. The intensity (F) of the field is proportional to the force it exerts on a magnet. Another common representation is in X (North), Y (East) and Z (Down) coordinates.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intensity of the field is often measured in gauss (G), but is generally reported in nanoteslas (nT), with 1?G = 100,000?nT. A nanotesla is also referred to as a gamma ().[13]   The tesla is the SI unit of the magnetic field, B.  The Earth's field ranges between approximately 25,000 and 65,000?nT (0.25ÿ0.65?G). By comparison, a strong refrigerator magnet has a field of about 10,000,000 nanoteslas (100?G).[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nA map of intensity contours is called an isodynamic chart. As the World Magnetic Model shows, the intensity tends to decrease from the poles to the equator. A minimum intensity occurs in the South Atlantic Anomaly over South America while there are maxima over northern Canada, Siberia, and the coast of Antarctica south of Australia.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inclination is given by an angle that can assume values between -90 (up) to 90 (down). In the northern hemisphere, the field points downwards. It is straight down at the North Magnetic Pole and rotates upwards as the latitude decreases until it is horizontal (0) at the magnetic equator. It continues to rotate upwards until it is straight up at the South Magnetic Pole. Inclination can be measured with a dip circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn isoclinic chart (map of inclination contours) for the Earth's magnetic field is shown below.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeclination is positive for an eastward deviation of the field relative to true north. It can be estimated by comparing the magnetic north/south heading on a compass with the direction of a celestial pole. Maps typically include information on the declination as an angle or a small diagram showing the relationship between magnetic north and true north. Information on declination for a region can be represented by a chart with isogonic lines (contour lines with each line representing a fixed declination).\\r\\n\\r\\nComponents of the Earth's magnetic field at the surface from the World Magnetic Model for 2015.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntensity\\r\\n\\r\\nInclination\\r\\n\\r\\nDeclination\\r\\n\\r\\nNear the surface of the Earth, its magnetic field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned at the center of the Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11 with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth.[13] The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole.[16] This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80ÿ90% of the field in most locations.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorically, the north and south poles of a magnet were first defined by the Earth's magnetic field, not vice versa, since one of the first uses for a magnet was as a compass needle. Its North pole was defined as the pole that would be attracted by the Earth's North Magnetic Pole when the magnet was suspended so it could turn freely. Since opposite poles attract, the North Magnetic Pole of the Earth is really the south pole of its magnetic field (the place where the field is directed downward into the Earth).[17][18][19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe positions of the magnetic poles can be defined in at least two ways: locally or globally.[21] The local definition is the point where the magnetic field is vertical.[22] This can be determined by measuring the inclination. The inclination of the Earth's field is 90 (downwards) at the North Magnetic Pole and -90 (upwards) at the South Magnetic Pole. The two poles wander independently of each other and are not directly opposite each other on the globe. They can migrate rapidly: movements of up to 40 kilometres (25?mi) per year have been observed for the North Magnetic Pole. Over the last 180 years, the North Magnetic Pole has been migrating northwestward, from Cape Adelaide in the Boothia Peninsula in 1831 to 600 kilometres (370?mi) from Resolute Bay in 2001.[23] The magnetic equator is the line where the inclination is zero (the magnetic field is horizontal).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe global definition of the Earth's field is based on a mathematical model. If a line is drawn through the center of the Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarth's magnetic field, predominantly dipolar at its surface, is distorted further out by the solar wind. This is a stream of charged particles leaving the Sun's corona and accelerating to a speed of 200 to 1000?kilometres per second. They carry with them a magnetic field, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF).[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solar wind exerts a pressure, and if it could reach Earth's atmosphere it would erode it. However, it is kept away by the pressure of the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetopause, the area where the pressures balance, is the boundary of the magnetosphere. Despite its name, the magnetosphere is asymmetric, with the sunward side being about 10?Earth radii out but the other side stretching out in a magnetotail that extends beyond 200?Earth radii.[25]\\r\\nSunward of the magnetopause is the bow shock, the area where the solar wind slows abruptly.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nInside the magnetosphere is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region begins at a height of 60?km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates with the Earth.[25] There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10?million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1ÿ2?Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4ÿ7?Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as deflecting the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field deflects cosmic rays, high-energy charged particles that are mostly from outside the Solar system. (Many cosmic rays are kept out of the Solar system by the Sun's magnetosphere, or heliosphere.[27]) By contrast, astronauts on the Moon risk exposure to radiation. Anyone who had been on the Moon's surface during a particularly violent solar eruption in 2005 would have received a lethal dose.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the charged particles do get into the magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing back and forth between the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving rise to a ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface.[24] Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe varying conditions in the magnetosphere, known as space weather, are largely driven by solar activity. If the solar wind is weak, the magnetosphere expands; while if it is strong, it compresses the magnetosphere and more of it gets in. Periods of particularly intense activity, called geomagnetic storms, can occur when a coronal mass ejection erupts above the Sun and sends a shock wave through the Solar System. Such a wave can take just two days to reach the Earth. Geomagnetic storms can cause a lot of disruption; the \\"Halloween\\" storm of 2003 damaged more than a third of NASA's satellites. The largest documented storm occurred in 1859. It induced currents strong enough to short out telegraph lines, and aurorae were reported as far south as Hawaii.[24][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe geomagnetic field changes on time scales from milliseconds to millions of years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes can be traced to geomagnetic storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrequently, the Earth's magnetosphere is hit by solar flares causing geomagnetic storms, provoking displays of aurorae. The short-term instability of the magnetic field is measured with the K-index.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nData from THEMIS show that the magnetic field, which interacts with the solar wind, is reduced when the magnetic orientation is aligned between Sun and Earth ÿ opposite to the previous hypothesis. During forthcoming solar storms, this could result in blackouts and disruptions in artificial satellites.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in Earth's magnetic field on a time scale of a year or more are referred to as secular variation. Over hundreds of years, magnetic declination is observed to vary over tens of degrees.[12] A movie on the right shows how global declinations have changed over the last few centuries.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direction and intensity of the dipole change over time. Over the last two centuries the dipole strength has been decreasing at a rate of about 6.3% per century.[12] At this rate of decrease, the field would be negligible in about 1600 years.[32] However, this strength is about average for the last 7 thousand years, and the current rate of change is not unusual.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nA prominent feature in the non-dipolar part of the secular variation is a westward drift at a rate of about 0.2 degrees per year.[32] This drift is not the same everywhere and has varied over time. The globally averaged drift has been westward since about 1400 AD but eastward between about 1000 AD and 1400 AD.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges that predate magnetic observatories are recorded in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes are referred to as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough generally Earth's field is approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly aligned with the rotational axis, occasionally the North and South geomagnetic poles trade places. Evidence for these geomagnetic reversals can be found in basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies.[36] Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent geomagnetic reversal, called the BrunhesÿMatuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago.[23][37] A related phenomenon, a geomagnetic excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity.[38][39] The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe past magnetic field is recorded mostly by strongly magnetic minerals, particularly iron oxides such as magnetite, that can carry a permanent magnetic moment. This remanent magnetization, or remanence, can be acquired in more than one way. In lava flows, the direction of the field is \\"frozen\\" in small minerals as they cool, giving rise to a thermoremanent magnetization. In sediments, the orientation of magnetic particles acquires a slight bias towards the magnetic field as they are deposited on an ocean floor or lake bottom. This is called detrital remanent magnetization.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThermoremanent magnetization is the main source of the magnetic anomalies around mid-ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust on both sides of the ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has spread in the past.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nRadiometric dating of lava flows has been used to establish a geomagnetic polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique that can be used to date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies of lava flows on Steens Mountain, Oregon, indicate that the magnetic field could have shifted at a rate of up to 6 degrees per day at some time in Earth's history, which significantly challenges the popular understanding of how the Earth's magnetic field works.[40] This finding was later attributed to unusual rock magnetic properties of the lava flow under study, not rapid field change, by one of the original authors of the 1995 study.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nTemporary dipole tilt variations that take the dipole axis across the equator and then back to the original polarity are known as excursions.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaleomagnetic studies of Paleoarchean lava in Australia and conglomerate in South Africa have concluded that the magnetic field has been present since at least about 3,450?million years ago.[42][43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt present, the overall geomagnetic field is becoming weaker; the present strong deterioration corresponds to a 10ÿ15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated in the past several years; geomagnetic intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nature of Earth's magnetic field is one of heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone up and down in the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic north pole is drifting from northern Canada towards Siberia with a presently accelerating rate10 kilometres (6.2?mi) per year at the beginning of the 20th century, up to 40 kilometres (25?mi) per year in 2003,[23] and since then has only accelerated.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by electric currents in the conductive material of its core, created by convection currents due to heat escaping from the core.  However the process is complex, and computer models that reproduce some of its features have only been developed in the last few decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth and most of the planets in the Solar System, as well as the Sun and other stars, all generate magnetic fields through the motion of electrically conducting fluids.[47] The Earth's field originates in its core. This is a region of iron alloys extending to about 3400?km (the radius of the Earth is 6370?km). It is divided into a solid inner core, with a radius of 1220?km, and a liquid outer core.[48] The motion of the liquid in the outer core is driven by heat flow from the inner core, which is about 6,000?K (5,730?C; 10,340?F), to the core-mantle boundary, which is about 3,800?K (3,530?C; 6,380?F).[49]  The heat is generated by potential energy released by heavier materials sinking toward the core (planetary differentiation, the iron catastrophe) as well as decay of radioactive elements in the interior.  The pattern of flow is organized by the rotation of the Earth and the presence of the solid inner core.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mechanism by which the Earth generates a magnetic field is known as a dynamo.[47] The magnetic field is generated by a feedback loop: current loops generate magnetic fields (Ampre's circuital law); a changing magnetic field generates an electric field (Faraday's law); and the electric and magnetic fields exert a force on the charges that are flowing in currents (the Lorentz force).[51] These effects can be combined in a partial differential equation for the magnetic field called the magnetic induction equation,\\r\\n\\r\\nwhere u is the velocity of the fluid; B is the magnetic B-field; and =1/ is the magnetic diffusivity, which is inversely proportional to the product of the electrical conductivity  and the permeability  .[52]  The term ?B/?t is the time derivative of the field; ?2 is the Laplace operator and ?G is the curl operator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first term on the right hand side of the induction equation is a diffusion term. In a stationary fluid, the magnetic field declines and any concentrations of field spread out. If the Earth's dynamo shut off, the dipole part would disappear in a few tens of thousands of years.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a perfect conductor (\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\sigma =\\\\infty \\\\;}\\r\\n\\r\\n), there would be no diffusion. By Lenz's law, any change in the magnetic field would be immediately opposed by currents, so the flux through a given volume of fluid could not change. As the fluid moved, the magnetic field would go with it. The theorem describing this effect is called the frozen-in-field theorem. Even in a fluid with a finite conductivity, new field is generated by stretching field lines as the fluid moves in ways that deform it. This process could go on generating new field indefinitely, were it not that as the magnetic field increases in strength, it resists fluid motion.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motion of the fluid is sustained by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards the center of the Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of the molten iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.[50][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nA dynamo can amplify a magnetic field, but it needs a \\"seed\\" field to get it started.[52] For the Earth, this could have been an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had a magnetic field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind.[53] However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias that are part of the boundary conditions for the geodynamo.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe average magnetic field in the Earth's outer core was calculated to be 25 gausses, 50 times stronger than the field at the surface.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimulating the geodynamo requires numerically solving a set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and the effect on the magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first self-consistent dynamo models, ones that determine both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, were developed by two groups in 1995, one in Japan[57] and one in the United States.[1][58] The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including geomagnetic reversals.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nElectric currents induced in the ionosphere generate magnetic fields (ionospheric dynamo region). Such a field is always generated near where the atmosphere is closest to the Sun, causing daily alterations that can deflect surface magnetic fields by as much as one degree. Typical daily variations of field strength are about 25 nanoteslas (nT) (one part in 2000), with variations over a few seconds of typically around 1 nT (one part in 50,000).[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Earth's magnetic field strength was measured by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1832[60] and has been repeatedly measured since then, showing a relative decay of about 10% over the last 150 years.[61] The Magsat satellite and later satellites have used 3-axis vector magnetometers to probe the 3-D structure of the Earth's magnetic field. The later ?rsted satellite allowed a comparison indicating a dynamic geodynamo in action that appears to be giving rise to an alternate pole under the Atlantic Ocean west of South Africa.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nGovernments sometimes operate units that specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are geomagnetic observatories, typically part of a national Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network, with over 100 interlinked geomagnetic observatories around the world, has been recording the Earth's magnetic field since 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe military determines local geomagnetic field characteristics, in order to detect anomalies in the natural background that might be caused by a significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommercially, geophysical prospecting companies also use magnetic detectors to identify naturally occurring anomalies from ore bodies, such as the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMagnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines,[64] the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt  the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor[65]  contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century.[66] More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach measurement of the magnetic field is at a particular place and time. If an accurate estimate of the field at some other place and time is needed, the measurements must be converted to a model and the model used to make predictions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common way of analyzing the global variations in the Earth's magnetic field is to fit the measurements to a set of spherical harmonics. This was first done by Carl Friedrich Gauss.[67] Spherical harmonics are functions that oscillate over the surface of a sphere. They are the product of two functions, one that depends on latitude and one on longitude. The function of longitude is zero along zero or more great circles passing through the North and South Poles; the number of such nodal lines is the absolute value of the order m. The function of latitude is zero along zero or more latitude circles; this plus the order is equal to the degree ?. Each harmonic is equivalent to a particular arrangement of magnetic charges at the center of the Earth. A monopole is an isolated magnetic charge, which has never been observed. A dipole is equivalent to two opposing charges brought close together and a quadrupole to two dipoles brought together. A quadrupole field is shown in the lower figure on the right.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpherical harmonics can represent any scalar field (function of position) that satisfies certain properties. A magnetic field is a vector field, but if it is expressed in Cartesian components X, Y, Z, each component is the derivative of the same scalar function called the magnetic potential. Analyses of the Earth's magnetic field use a modified version of the usual spherical harmonics that differ by a multiplicative factor. A least-squares fit to the magnetic field measurements gives the Earth's field as the sum of spherical harmonics, each multiplied by the best-fitting  Gauss coefficient gm? or hm?.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lowest-degree Gauss coefficient, g00, gives the contribution of an isolated magnetic charge, so it is zero. The next three coefficients ÿ g10, g11, and h11 ÿ determine the direction and magnitude of the dipole contribution. The best fitting dipole is tilted at an angle of about 10 with respect to the rotational axis, as described earlier.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nSpherical harmonic analysis can be used to distinguish internal from external sources if measurements are available at more than one height (for example, ground observatories and satellites). In that case, each term with coefficient gm? or hm? can be split into two terms: one that decreases with radius as 1/r?+1 and one that increases with radius as r?. The increasing terms fit the external sources (currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere). However, averaged over a few years the external contributions average to zero.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remaining terms predict that the potential of a dipole source (?=1) drops off as 1/r2. The magnetic field, being a derivative of the potential, drops off as 1/r3. Quadrupole terms drop off as 1/r4, and higher order terms drop off increasingly rapidly with the radius. The radius of the outer core is about half of the radius of the Earth. If the field at the core-mantle boundary is fit to spherical harmonics, the dipole part is smaller by a factor of about 8 at the surface, the quadrupole part by a factor of 16, and so on. Thus, only the components with large wavelengths can be noticeable at the surface. From a variety of arguments, it is usually assumed that only terms up to degree 14 or less have their origin in the core. These have wavelengths of about 2,000 kilometres (1,200?mi) or less. Smaller features are attributed to crustal anomalies.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy maintains a standard global field model called the International Geomagnetic Reference Field. It is updated every five years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed using data from satellites (?rsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of geomagnetic observatories.[68] The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother global field model, called the World Magnetic Model, is produced jointly by the United States National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Geophysical Data Center) and the British Geological Survey. This model truncates at degree 12 (168 coefficients) with an approximate spatial resolution of 3,000 kilometers. It is the model used by the United States Department of Defense, the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom), the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the International Hydrographic Office as well as in many civilian navigation systems.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nA third model, produced by the Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA and GSFC) and the Danish Space Research Institute, uses a \\"comprehensive modeling\\" approach that attempts to reconcile data with greatly varying temporal and spatial resolution from ground and satellite sources.[71]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor users with higher accuracy needs, the United States National Centers for Environmental Information developed  the Enhanced Magnetic Model (EMM), which extends to degree and order 790 and resolves magnetic anomalies down to a wavelength of 56 kilometers. It was compiled from satellite, marine, aeromagnetic and ground magnetic surveys. As of  2018[update], the latest version, EMM2017, includes data from The European Space Agency's Swarm satellite mission.[72]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth's magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration.[73] Some researchers have found that cows and wild deer tend to align their bodies north-south while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high-voltage power lines, suggesting that magnetism is responsible.[74][75] Other researchers reported in 2011 that they could not replicate those findings using different Google Earth images.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers found out that very weak electromagnetic fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals are to blame for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds;[77] instead, the culprits have frequencies between 2?kHz and 5?MHz. These include AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.[78]","input":"What is earth's magnetic field generated by?"},{"output":"Don Messick","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo is an American animated cartoon franchise, comprising many animated television series produced from 1969 to the present day. Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears  created the original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, for Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured four teenagersFred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville \\"Shaggy\\" Rogersand their talking brown Great Dane[1] named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the success of the original series, Hanna-Barbera and its successor Warner Bros. Animation have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.ÿproduced theatrical feature films. Some versions of Scooby-Doo feature different variations on the show's supernatural theme, and include characters such as Scooby's cousin Scooby-Dum and nephew Scrappy-Doo in addition to or instead of some of the original characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo was originally broadcast on CBS from 1969 to 1975, when it moved to ABC. ABC aired the show until canceling it in 1986, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, from 1988 until 1991. New Scooby-Doo series aired as part of Kids' WB on The WB Network and its successor, The CW Network, from 2002 until 2008. Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated aired on Cartoon Network from 2010 to 2013,[3] and Be Cool, Scooby-Doo! debuted on Cartoon Network in 2015.[4] Repeats of the various Scooby-Doo series are broadcast frequently on Cartoon Network and its sister channel Boomerang in the United States as well as other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked Scooby-Doo the fifth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1968, parent-run organizations, particularly Action for Children's Television (ACT), began to protest about what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday morning cartoons.[6]  Most of these shows were Hanna-Barbera action cartoons such as Space Ghost, The Herculoids and Birdman and the Galaxy Trio, and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups.[7] Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that their new programs would be safe for children.\\r\\n\\r\\nFred Silverman, executive in charge of daytime programming for the CBS network at the time, was looking for a show that would revitalize his Saturday morning line and simultaneously please the watch groups. The result was The Archie Show, based upon Bob Montana's teenage humor comic book Archie. Also successful were the musical numbers The Archies performed during each program (one of which, \\"Sugar, Sugar\\", was the most successful Billboard number-one hit of 1969). Silverman was eager to build upon this success, and contacted producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera about possibly creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this one featuring teens who solved mysteries in between gigs. Silverman envisaged the show as a cross between the popular I Love a Mystery radio serials of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter attempting to develop his own version of the proposed show called House of Mystery,[1] Barbera, who handled the development and sale of Hanna-Barbera shows while Hanna handled production,[1] passed the task along to story writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears and artist/character designer Iwao Takamoto. Their original treatment, based in part on The Archie Show, was titled Mysteries Five and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, Linda's brother W.W. and their bongo-playing dog, Too Much, who were all members of the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, zombies, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty dog.[1] When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a Great Dane but revised the dog character to a large sheepdog (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, Hot Dog) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character Marmaduke.[1] Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.[1][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the design phase, lead character designer Takamoto consulted a studio colleague who was a breeder of Great Danes. After learning the characteristics of a prize-winning Great Dane from her, Takamoto proceeded to break most of the rules and designed Too Much with overly bowed legs, a double chin, and a sloped back, among other abnormalities.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nRuby and Spears' second pass at the show used Dobie Gillis as the template for the teenagers rather than Archie. The treatment retained the dog Too Much, while reducing the number of teenagers to four, removing the Mike character and retaining Geoff, Kelly, Linda, and W.W.[9] As their personalities were modified, so were the characters' names: Geoff became \\"Ronnie\\"[12] ÿ later renamed \\"Fred\\" (at Silverman's behest),[13] Kelly became \\"Daphne\\", Linda \\"Velma\\", and W.W. \\"Shaggy\\". The teens were now based on four teenage characters from The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis: Dobie Gillis, Thalia Menninger, Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs, respectively.[1][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revised show was re-pitched to Silverman, who liked the material but, disliking the title Mysteries Five, decided to call the show Who's S-S-Scared?[16] Silverman presented Who's S-S-Scared? to the CBS executives as the centerpiece for the upcoming 1969ÿ70 season's Saturday morning cartoon block. CBS president Frank Stanton felt that the presentation artwork was too scary for young viewers and, thinking the show would be the same, decided to pass on it.[9][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow without a centerpiece for the upcoming season's programming, Silverman had Ruby, Spears, and the Hanna-Barbera staff revise the treatments and presentation materials to tone down the show and better reflect its comedy elements. The rock band element was dropped, and more attention was focused upon Shaggy and Too Much. According to Ruby and Spears, Silverman was inspired by Frank Sinatra's scat \\"doo-be-doo-be-doo\\" at the end of his recording of \\"Strangers in the Night\\" on a flight to one of the development meetings, and decided to rename the dog \\"Scooby-Doo\\" and re-rechristen the show Scooby-Doo, Where Are You![9] The revised show was re-presented to CBS executives, who approved it for production.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! \\"What a Night for a Knight\\" debuted on the CBS network Saturday, September 13, 1969. The original voice cast featured veteran voice actor Don Messick as Scooby-Doo, radio DJ Casey Kasem (later host of radio's syndicated American Top 40) as Shaggy, actor Frank Welker (later a veteran voice actor in his own right) as Fred, actress Nicole Jaffe as Velma, and musician Indira Stefanianna Christopherson as Daphne.[17] Scooby's speech patterns closely resembled an earlier cartoon dog, Astro from The Jetsons (1962ÿ63), also voiced by Messick.[2] Seventeen episodes of Scooby-Doo Where are You! were produced in 1969ÿ70. The series theme song was written by David Mook and Ben Raleigh, and performed by Larry Marks.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these episodes features Scooby and the four teenage members of Mystery, Inc., Fred, Shaggy, Daphne and Velma, arriving at a location in the Mystery Machine, a van painted with psychedelic colors and flower power imagery. Encountering a ghost, monster, or other ostensibly supernatural creature terrorizing the local populace, they decide to investigate. The kids split up to look for clues and suspects while being chased at turns by the monster. Eventually, the kids come to realize the ghost and other paranormal activity is actually an elaborate hoax, andoften with the help of a Rube Goldberg-like trap designed by Fredthey capture the villain and unmask him. Revealed as a flesh and blood crook trying to cover up crimes by using the ghost story and costume, the criminal is arrested and taken to jail, often repeating something nearly identical to \\"... and I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nScheduled opposite another teenage mystery-solving show, ABC's The Hardy Boys, Scooby-Doo became a ratings success, with Nielsen ratings reporting that as many as 65% of Saturday morning audiences were tuned in to CBS when Scooby-Doo was being broadcast.[1][9] The show was renewed for a second season in 1970, for which eight episodes were produced. Seven of the second-season episodes featured chase sequences set to bubblegum pop songs recorded by Austin Roberts,[18] who also re-recorded the theme song for this season. With Stefanianna Christopherson having married and retired from voice acting, Heather North assumed the role of Daphne, and would continue to voice the character until 1997.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV influences of I Love a Mystery and Dobie Gillis were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the Scooby-Doo teens and the Dobie Gillis teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same beatnik-style goatee, similar hairstyles, and demeanors.[1] The core premise of Scooby-Doo, Where are You! was also similar to Enid Blyton's Famous Five books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories would often revolve around a mystery which would invariably turn out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to disguise the villain's true intent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a Bob Hope-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery.[9] Later versions of the show would make slight changes to the characters' established roles, most notably in the character of Daphne, shown in 1990s and 2000s Scooby-Doo productions as knowing many forms of karate and having the ability to defend herself, and less of a tendency towards getting kidnapped.\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo itself would be an influence on many other Saturday morning cartoons of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its competitors produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including Josie and the Pussycats (1970ÿ71), The Funky Phantom (1971ÿ72), The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan (1972ÿ73), Speed Buggy (1973ÿ74), Goober and the Ghost Chasers (1973ÿ74), Jabberjaw (1976ÿ78), Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels (1977ÿ80), among others.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title The New Scooby-Doo Movies were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as Harlem Globetrotters, Josie and the Pussycats and Speed Buggy, the comic book characters Batman and Robin (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, Super Friends, a year later), and celebrities such as Sandy Duncan, The Addams Family, Cass Elliot, Phyllis Diller, Don Knotts and The Three Stooges. Hanna-Barbera musical director Hoyt Curtin composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme would remain in use for much of Scooby-Doo's original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the New Movies format from 1972 to 1974, CBS began airing reruns of the original Scooby-Doo, Where are You! series until its option on the series ran out in 1976.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nNow president of ABC, Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of Scooby-Doo to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976ÿ77 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, Dynomutt, Dog Wonder, to create The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour (the show became The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show when a bonus Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original Scooby-Doo, Where are You! format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin Scooby-Dum, voiced by Daws Butler, as a recurring character.[1] The voice cast was held over from The New Scooby-Doo Movies save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. Pat Stevens took over her role as the voice of Velma.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the 1977ÿ78 season, The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show became the two-hour programming block Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics (1977ÿ78) with the addition of Laff-a-Lympics and Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels. In addition to eight new episodes of Scooby-Doo and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the All-Star block's Laff-a-Lympics series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in Battle of the Network Stars-esque parodies of Olympic sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the Laff-a-Lympics \\"Scooby Doobies\\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics was retitled Scooby's All Stars for the 1978ÿ79 season, reduced to 90 minutes when Dynomutt was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. Scooby's All-Stars continued broadcasting reruns of Scooby-Doo from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of Scooby-Doo aired during a separate half-hour under the Scooby-Doo, Where are You! banner. After nine weeks, the separate Where are You! broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the Scooby's All-Stars block.[21] The 40 total Scooby-Doo episodes produced from 1976 to 1978 were later packaged together for syndication as The Scooby-Doo Show, under which title they continue to air.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scooby-Doo characters first appeared outside of their regular Saturday morning format in Scooby Goes Hollywood, an hour-long ABC television special aired in prime time on December 13, 1979. The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as Happy Days, Superman: The Movie, Laverne & Shirley and Charlie's Angels.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew Scrappy-Doo was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost Scooby-Doo's slipping ratings.[22] The 1979ÿ80 episodes, aired under the new title Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. Lennie Weinrib voiced Scrappy in the 1979ÿ80 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter.[22] Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the new Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo format now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute Scooby and Scrappy cartoons, who in previous Scooby series had been revealed to be human criminals in costume, were now real within the context of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show, an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new Richie Rich cartoon, adapted from the Harvey Comics character. From 1982 to 1983, Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo were part of The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour, a co-production with Ruby-Spears Productions which featured two Scooby and Scrappy shorts, a Scrappy and Yabba-Doo short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his Western deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and The Puppy's New Adventures, based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of Scooby-Doo were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles Scooby-Doo Classics, Scary Scooby Funnies, The Best of Scooby-Doo, and Scooby's Mystery Funhouse, the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries. The 1984ÿ85 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n1985 saw the debut of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by Susan Blu)[24] and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by Vincent Price) traveling the globe to capture \\"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\\" The final first-run episode of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new Scooby series aired on the network for the next two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nHanna-Barbera reincarnated the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! cast as junior high school students for a new series titled A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, which debuted on ABC in 1988. A Pup Named Scooby-Doo was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of Tex Avery and Bob Clampett, and eschewed the quasi-reality of the original Scooby series for a more Looney Tunes-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \\"Scoobert\\". The series also established \\"Coolsville\\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later Scooby productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Pup Named Scooby-Doo was developed and produced by Tom Ruegger, who had been the head story editor on Scooby-Doo since 1983. Following the first season of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to Warner Bros. Animation to develop Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures and later Animaniacs, Pinky and the Brain, and Freakazoid!.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10, a series of syndicated TV movie featuring their most popular characters, including Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, The Flintstones and The Jetsons. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers (1987), Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School (1988), and Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie Arabian Nights, originally broadcast by TBS in 1994, Don Messick's final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\\r\\n\\r\\nReruns of Scooby-Doo have been in syndication since 1980, and have also been shown on cable television networks such as TBS Superstation (until 1989) and USA Network (as part of the USA Cartoon Express from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With Turner Broadcasting purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the Scooby-Doo franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and TNT.[25] Canadian network Teletoon began airing Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! in 1997, with the other Scooby series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, Scooby-Doo became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station Boomerang.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Scooby-Doo's restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network,[25] Warner Bros. Animation and Hanna-Barbera (by then a subsidiary of Warner Bros. following the merger of Time Warner and Turner Entertainment in 1996) began producing one new Scooby-Doo direct-to-video movie a year beginning in 1998.[25] These movies featured a slightly older version of the original five-character cast from the Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! days. The first four DTV entries were Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island (1998), Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost (1999), Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders (2000), and Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 Burger King commercial.[26] Therefore, Scott Innes took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy (Billy West voiced Shaggy in Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island). B.J. Ward took over as Velma, and Mary Kay Bergman voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by Grey DeLisle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting voodoo-worshiping cat creatures in the Louisiana bayou. Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost featured an author (voice of Tim Curry) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. The Witch's Ghost introduced a goth rock band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the Scooby-Doo franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company Warner Bros. Animation following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation would continue production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new Scooby-Doo series for television.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire and Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of What's New, Scooby-Doo, using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature Matthew Lillard as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical Scooby-Doo films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood and Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, a live-action TV movie, Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins, was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut.[27] The film starred Nick Palatas as Shaggy, Robbie Amell as Fred, Kate Melton as Daphne, Hayley Kiyoko as Velma, and Frank Welker as the voice of Scooby-Doo. A second live-action TV movie, Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster, retained the same cast and aired on October 16, 2010 and a  direct-to-video spin-off Daphne & Velma in 2018. The three films are served as prequels taking place before the events of the 2002 film.\\r\\n\\r\\nA feature-length live-action film version of Scooby-Doo was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 14, 2002. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the film starred Freddie Prinze, Jr., as Fred, Sarah Michelle Gellar as Daphne, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy, and Linda Cardellini as Velma. Scooby-Doo, voiced by Neil Fanning, was created on-screen by computer-generated special effects. Scooby-Doo was a financially successful release, with a domestic box office gross of over US$130 million.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nA sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, followed in March 2004 with the same cast and director. Scooby-Doo 2 earned US$84 (?55,98) million at the U.S. box office.[29] A third film was planned, but later scrapped following Warner Bros.' disappointment at the returns from Scooby-Doo 2.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 26, 2013, it was announced that Warner Bros. Pictures is developing an animated Scooby-Doo feature film with Atlas Entertainment. Charles Roven and Richard Suckle, who produced the first two live-action films, are producing the animated film, and Matt Lieberman will be writing the film.[32] On June 17, 2014, Warner Brothers studio announced that they will restart the film series with Randall Green writing a new movie.[33][34] On August 17, 2015, Warner Bros announced that Tony Cervone will direct the animated film, with Allison Abbate as producer and  Dan Povenmire as executive producer. The film was planned for a September 21, 2018 release.[35] On April 13, 2016, it was announced that it would be titled S.C.O.O.B. and would be the first film in a Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe.[36] In May 2017, the film was pushed back to May 15, 2020.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, following the successes of the Cartoon Network reruns, the direct to video franchise, and the first feature film, Scooby-Doo returned to Saturday morning for the first time in 17 years with What's New, Scooby-Doo?, which aired on Kids' WB from 2002 until 2006. Produced by Warner Bros. Animation, the show follows the format of the original series but places it in the 21st century, featuring a heavy promotion of modern technology (computers, DVD, the Internet, cell phones) and culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning with this series, Frank Welker took over as Scooby's voice actor, while continuing to provide the voice of Fred as well. Casey Kasem returned as Shaggy, on the condition that the character be depicted as a vegetarian like Kasem himself.[26] Grey DeLisle continued to voice Daphne, and former Facts of Life star Mindy Cohn voiced Velma. The series was produced by Chuck Sheetz, who had worked on The Simpsons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter three seasons, What's New, Scooby-Doo was replaced in September 2006 with Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!, a major revamping of the series which debuted on The CW's Kids' WB Saturday morning programming block. In the new premise, Shaggy inherits money and a mansion from an uncle, an inventor who has gone into hiding from villains trying to steal his secret invention. The villains, led by \\"Dr. Phibes\\" (based primarily upon Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers series, and named after Vincent Price's character from The Abominable Dr. Phibes), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone. Fred, Daphne, and Velma are normally absent, but do make appearances at times to help. The characters were redesigned and the art style revised for the new series. Scott Menville voiced Shaggy in the series, with Casey Kasem appearing as the voice of Shaggy's Uncle Albert. Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue! ran for two seasons on The CW.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Scooby series, Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010.[3] The first Scooby series produced for cable television, Mystery Incorporated is a reboot of the franchise, re-establishing the characters' relationships, personalities, and locations, and expanding their world to feature their parents, high school, and neighbors. The series also borrowed pieces from many parts of Scooby-Doo's long history, as well as characters and elements of other Hanna-Barbera shows to form its back story and the bases of some of its episodes. Matthew Lillard was brought over from the direct-to-video series as the new voice of Shaggy, while Welker, Cohn, and DeLisle continued in their respective roles. Patrick Warburton, Linda Cardellini, Lewis Black, Vivica A. Fox, Gary Cole, Udo Kier, Tim Matheson, Tia Carrere, and Kate Higgins were added as new semi-regular cast members. Casey Kasem appeared in a recurring role as Shaggy's father, one of his last roles before retiring due to declining health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series, while still following the basic mystery-solving format of its predecessors, was broadcast as a 52-chapter animated televised novel and included elements similar to live-action mystery/adventure shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer[38] and Lost.[39] An overarching mystery surrounding the gang's hometown of Crystal Cove, California became the series' main story arc, with pieces to the mystery unfolding episode by episode. Also featured were romantic entanglements and interpersonal conflict between the lead characters. The series ran for 52 episodes over two seasons, with a three-part finale airing across April 4 and 5, 2013 ÿ exactly three years from the debut.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 10, 2014, Cartoon Network announced several new series based on classic cartoons, including a new Scooby-Doo animated series titled Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!.[40] The show features the gang \\"living it up\\" the summer after the gang's senior year of high school. Along the way, they run into monsters and mayhem.[41] The series premiered October 5, 2015 on Cartoon Network.[42] The series premiered on October 5, 2015 and concluded on March 18, 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginning in 2012, Warner Bros. Animation began producing direct-to-video special episodes in the style of the concurrently produced films for inclusion on Scooby-Doo compilation DVD sets otherwise including episodes from previous Scooby series. These include Scooby-Doo! Spooky Games, included on the July 2012 release Scooby-Doo! Laff-A-Lympics: Spooky Games,[43][44] Scooby-Doo! Haunted Holidays, from the October 2012 release Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Holiday Chills and Thrills, and Scooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow and Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace, from the September 2013 DVD releases Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Run for Your 'Rife![45] and Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Ruh-Roh Robot!.[46] On May 13, 2014, another episode, Scooby-Doo! Ghastly Goals was released on the Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Field of Screams DVD.[47] On May 5, 2015, Scooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie, the sixth direct-to-video special, was released on the Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales: Surf's Up Scooby-Doo DVD.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring its four decade broadcast history, Scooby-Doo has received two Emmy nominations: a 1989 Daytime Emmy nomination for A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, and a 2003 Daytime Emmy nomination for What's New, Scooby-Doo's Mindy Cohn in the \\"Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program\\" category.[51] Science advocate Carl Sagan favorably compared the predominantly skeptic oriented formula to that of most television dealing with paranormal themes, and considered that an adult analogue to Scooby-Doo would be a great public service.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo has maintained a significant fan base, which has grown steadily since the 1990s due to the show's popularity among both young children and nostalgic adults who grew up with the series.[53] Several television critics have stated that the show's mix of the comedy-adventure and horror genres was the reason for its widespread success.[54] As Fred Silverman and the Hanna-Barbera staff had planned when they first began producing the series, Scooby-Doo's ghosts, monsters and spooky locales tend more towards humor than horror, making them easily accessible to younger children. \\"Overall, [Scooby-Doo is] just not a show that is going to overstimulate kids' emotions and tensions,\\" offered American Center for Children and Media executive director David Kleeman in a 2002 interview. \\"It creates just enough fun to make it fun without getting them worried or giving them nightmares.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nOlder teenagers and adults have admitted to enjoying Scooby-Doo because of presumed subversive themes which involve theories of drug use and sexuality, in particular that Shaggy is assumed to be a user of cannabis and Velma is assumed to be a lesbian.[56][57][58] Such themes were pervasive enough in popular culture to find their way into Warner Bros.' initial Scooby-Doo feature film in 2002,[58][59] though several of the scenes were edited before release to secure a family-friendly \\"PG\\" rating.[59] Series creators Joe Ruby and Ken Spears reported that they \\"took umbrage\\" to the inclusion of such themes in the Scooby-Doo feature and other places, and denied intending their characters to be drug users in any way.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many Hanna-Barbera shows, the early Scooby-Doo series have been criticized at times for their production values and storytelling.[60] In 2002, Jamie Malanowski of the New York Times commented that \\"[Scooby-Doo's] mysteries are not very mysterious, and the humor is hardly humorous. As for the animationwell, the drawings on your refrigerator may give it competition.\\"[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 2000s, Scooby-Doo had received recognition for its popularity by placing in a number of top cartoon or top cartoon character polls. The August 3, 2002, issue of TV Guide featured its list of the 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time, in which Scooby-Doo placed twenty-second[62] Scooby also ranked thirteenth in Animal Planet's list of the 50 Greatest TV Animals.[63]  For one year from 2004 to 2005, Scooby-Doo held the Guinness World Record for having the most episodes of any animated television series ever produced, a record previously held by and later returned to The Simpsons. Scooby-Doo was published as holding this record in the 2006 edition of the Guinness Book of Records.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2009, entertainment website IGN named Scooby-Doo #24 on its list of the Top 100 Best Animated TV Shows.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nGold Key Comics began publication of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! comic books in December 1969. The comics initially contained adaptations of episodes of the television show drawn by Phil DeLara, Jack Manning and Warren Tufts. The comic books later moved to all-original stories until ending with issue #30 in 1974. Several of these issues were written by Mark Evanier and drawn by Dan Spiegle.[22][66] Charlton published Scooby comics, many drawn by Bill Williams, for 11 issues in 1975. From 1977 to 1979, Marvel Comics published nine issues of Scooby-Doo, all written by Evanier and drawn by Spiegel. Harvey Comics published reprints of the Charlton comics, as well as a handful of special issues, between 1993 and 1994.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, Archie Comics began publishing a monthly Scooby-Doo comic book, the first year of which featured Scrappy-Doo among its cast. Evanier and Spiegel worked on three issues of the series, which ended after 21 issues in 1997 when Warner Bros.' DC Comics acquired the rights to publish comics based on Hanna-Barbera characters. DC's Scooby-Doo series continues publication to this day. In 2013, DC began a digital bi-monthly comic book titled Scooby-Doo Team-Up, crossing over Mystery Inc. with other DC and Hanna-Barbera characters. Since then, the series has become a monthly comic book available in print.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, a limited series of a 100 comic books called Scooby-Doo! World of Mystery was released. In each issue, Mystery Inc. go from country to country solving mysteries. Each issue came with a pack of exclusive cards, with 350 in total able to be collected.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, DC launched a new monthly comic book entitled Scooby Apocalypse, with the characters being reinvented in a story set in a post-apocalyptic world, where monsters roam the streets and Scooby and the gang must find a way to survive at all costs, while also trying to find a way to reverse the apocalypse.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Scooby-Doo merchandise included a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, decorated lunch boxes, iron-on transfers, coloring books, story books, records, underwear, and other such goods.[68] When Scrappy-Doo was introduced to the series in 1979, he, Scooby, and Shaggy became the sole foci of much of the merchandising, including a 1983 Milton-Bradley Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo board game. The first Scooby-Doo video game appeared in arcades in 1986, and has been followed by a number of games for both home consoles and personal computers. Scooby-Doo multivitamins also debuted at this time, and have been manufactured by Bayer since 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nScooby-Doo merchandising tapered off during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but increased after the series' revival on Cartoon Network in 1995. Today, all manner of Scooby-Doo-branded products are available for purchase, including Scooby-Doo breakfast cereal, plush toys, action figures, car decorations, and much more. Real \\"Scooby Snacks\\" dog treats are produced by Del Monte Pet Products. Hasbro has created a number of Scooby board games, including a Scooby-themed edition of the popular mystery board game Clue. In 2007, the Pressman Toy Corporation released the board game Scooby-Doo! Haunted House. Beginning in 2001, a Scooby-Doo children's book series was authorized and published by Scholastic. These books, written by Suzanne Weyn, include original stories and adaptations of Scooby theatrical and direct-to-video features.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1990 to 2002, Shaggy and Scooby-Doo appeared as characters in the Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera simulator ride at Universal Studios Florida.[69] The ride was replaced in the early 2000s with a Jimmy Neutron attraction, and The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera instead became an attraction at several properties operated by Paramount Parks. Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are currently costumed characters at Universal Studios Florida, and can be seen driving the Mystery Machine around the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, Scooby-Doo in Stagefright, a live stage play based upon the series, began touring across the world. A follow-up, Scooby-Doo and the Pirate Ghost, followed in 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the various Scooby-Doo merchandise has generated over one billion dollars in profit for Warner Brothers.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with most popular franchises, Scooby-Doo has been parodied and has done parodies.","input":"Who was the original voice of scooby doo?"},{"output":"as early as the middle Harappan Phase (2600-1900 BCE)","context":"Indian Ocean Trade has been a key factor in EastÿWest exchanges throughout history. Long distance trade in dhows and sailboats made it a dynamic zone of interaction between peoples, cultures, and civilizations stretching from Java in the East to Zanzibar and Mombasa in the West. Cities and states on the Indian Ocean rim were Janus-faced. They looked outward to the sea as much as they looked inward to the hinterland.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an extensive maritime trade network operating between the Harappan and Mesopotamian civilizations as early as the middle Harappan Phase (2600-1900 BCE), with much commerce being handled by \\"middlemen merchants from Dilmun\\" (modern Bahrain and Failaka located in the Persian Gulf).[1] Such long-distance sea trade became feasible with the development of plank-built watercraft, equipped with a single central mast supporting a sail of woven rushes or cloth.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral coastal settlements like Sotkagen-dor (astride Dasht River, north of Jiwani), Sokhta Koh (astride Shadi River, north of Pasni), and Balakot (near Sonmiani) in Pakistan along with Lothal in western India, testify to their role as Harappan trading outposts. Shallow harbours located at the estuaries of rivers opening into the sea allowed brisk maritime trade with Mesopotamian cities.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to Roman expansion, the various peoples of the subcontinent had established strong maritime trade with other countries. The dramatic increase in South Asian ports, however, did not occur until the opening of the Red Sea by the Greeks and the Romans and the attainment of geographical knowledge concerning the regions seasonal monsoons. In fact, the first two centuries of the Common Era indicate this increase in trade between present-day western India and Rome. This expansion of trade was due to the comparative peace established by the Roman Empire during the time of Augustus (23 September 63 BC ÿ 19 August AD 14), which allowed for new explorations. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe replacement of Greece by the Roman empire as the administrator of the Mediterranean basin led to the strengthening of direct maritime trade with the east and the elimination of the taxes extracted previously by the middlemen of various land-based trading routes.[2] Strabo's mention of the vast increase in trade following the Roman annexation of Egypt indicates that monsoon was known and manipulated for trade in his time.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe trade started by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 130 BCE kept increasing, and according to Strabo (II.5.12.), writing some 150 years later:[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any rate, when Gallus was prefect of Egypt, I accompanied him and ascended the Nile as far as Syene and the frontiers of Kingdom of Aksum (Ethiopia), and I learned that as many as one hundred and twenty vessels were sailing from Myos Hormos to the subcontinent, whereas formerly, under the Ptolemies, only a very few ventured to undertake the voyage and to carry on traffic in Indian merchandise.\\r\\nBy the time of Augustus up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from Myos Hormos to India.[4] So much gold was used for this trade, and apparently recycled by the Kushan Empire (Kushans) for their own coinage, that Pliny the Elder (NH VI.101) complained about the drain of specie to India:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three main Roman ports involved with eastern trade were Arsinoe, Berenice and Myos Hormos. Arsinoe was one of the early trading centers but was soon overshadowed by the more easily accessible Myos Hormos and Berenice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ptolemaic dynasty exploited the strategic position of Alexandria to secure trade with the subcontinent.[6] The course of trade with the east then seems to have been first through the harbor of Arsinoe, the present day Suez.[6] The goods from the East African trade were landed at one of the three main Roman ports, Arsinoe, Berenice or Myos Hormos.[7] The Romans repaired and cleared out the silted up canal from the Nile to harbor center of Arsinoe on the Red Sea.[8]  This was one of the many efforts the Roman administration had to undertake to divert as much of the trade to the maritime routes as possible.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nArsinoe was eventually overshadowed by the rising prominence of Myos Hormos.[8] The navigation to the northern ports, such as Arsinoe-Clysma, became difficult in comparison to Myos Hormos due to the northern winds in the Gulf of Suez.[9] Venturing to these northern ports presented additional difficulties such as shoals, reefs and treacherous currents.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMyos Hormos and Berenice appear to have been important ancient trading ports, possibly used by the Pharaonic traders of ancient Egypt and the Ptolemaic dynasty before falling into Roman control.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe site of Berenice, since its discovery by Belzoni (1818), has been equated  with the ruins near Ras Banas in Southern Egypt.[10] However, the precise location of Myos Hormos is disputed with the latitude and longitude given in Ptolemy's Geography favoring Abu Sha'ar and the accounts given in classical literature and satellite images indicating a probable identification with Quseir el-Quadim at the end of a fortified road from Koptos on the Nile.[10] The Quseir el-Quadim site has further been associated with Myos Hormos following the excavations at el-Zerqa, halfway along the route, which have revealed ostraca leading to the conclusion that the port at the end of this road may have been Myos Hormos.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regional ports of Barbaricum (modern Karachi), Sounagoura (central Bangladesh) Barygaza, Muziris in Kerala,  Korkai, Kaveripattinam and Arikamedu on the southern tip of present-day India were the main centers of this trade, along with Kodumanal, an inland city. The Periplus Maris Erythraei describes Greco-Roman merchants selling in Barbaricum \\"thin clothing, figured linens, topaz, coral, storax, frankincense, vessels of glass, silver and gold plate, and a little wine\\" in exchange for \\"costus, bdellium, lycium, nard, turquoise, lapis lazuli, Seric skins, cotton cloth, silk yarn, and indigo\\".[11] In Barygaza, they would buy wheat, rice, sesame oil, cotton and cloth.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nTrade with Barigaza, under the control of the Indo-Scythian Western Satrap Nahapana (\\"Nambanus\\"), was especially flourishing:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are imported into this market-town (Barigaza), wine, Italian preferred, also Laodicean and Arabian; copper, tin, and lead; coral and topaz; thin clothing and inferior sorts of all kinds; bright-colored girdles a cubit wide; storax, sweet clover, flint glass, realgar, antimony, gold and silver coin, on which there is a profit when exchanged for the money of the country; and ointment, but not very costly and not much. And for the King there are brought into those places very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments. There are exported from these places spikenard, costus, bdellium, ivory, agate and carnelian, lycium, cotton cloth of all kinds, silk cloth, mallow cloth, yarn, long pepper and such other things as are brought here from the various market-towns. Those bound for this market-town from Egypt make the voyage favorably about the month of July, that is Epiphi.\\r\\nMuziris is a lost port city on the south-western coast of India which was a major center of trade in the ancient Tamil land between the Chera kingdom and the Roman Empire.[12] Its location is generally identified with modern-day Cranganore (central Kerala).[13][14] Large hoards of coins and innumerable shards of amphorae found at the town of Pattanam (near Cranganore) have elicited recent archeological interest in finding a probable location of this port city.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Periplus, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThen come Naura and Tyndis, the first markets of Damirica (Limyrike), and then Muziris and Nelcynda, which are now of leading importance. Tyndis is of the Kingdom of Cerobothra; it is a village in plain sight by the sea. Muziris, of the same Kingdom, abounds in ships sent there with cargoes from Arabia, and by the Greeks; it is located on a river, distant from Tyndis by river and sea five hundred stadia, and up the river from the shore twenty stadia\\"\\r\\nThe Periplus Maris Erythraei mentions a marketplace named Poduke (ch. 60), which G.W.B. Huntingford identified as possibly being Arikamedu in Tamil Nadu, a centre of early Chola trade (now part of Ariyankuppam), about 3 kilometres (1.9?mi) from the modern Pondicherry.[15] Huntingford further notes that Roman pottery was found at Arikamedu in 1937, and archeological excavations between 1944 and 1949 showed that it was \\"a trading station to which goods of Roman manufacture were imported during the first half of the 1st century AD\\".[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the Roman-Persian Wars, the areas under the Roman Byzantine Empire were captured by Khosrow II of the Persian Sassanian Dynasty,[16] but the Byzantine emperor Heraclius reconquered them (628). The Arabs, led by 'Amr ibn al-'As, crossed into Egypt in late 639 or early 640 CE.[17] This advance marked the beginning of the Islamic conquest of Egypt[17] and the fall of ports such as Alexandria,[18] used to secure trade with the subcontinent by the Roman world since the Ptolemaic dynasty.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decline in trade saw the ancient Tamil country turn to Southeast Asia for international trade, where it influenced the native culture to a greater degree than the impressions made on Rome.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Satavahanas developed shipping ventures in Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 8th century depiction of a wooden double outrigger and sailed Borobudur ship in ancient Java suggests that there were ancient trading links across the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and Madagascar and East Africa sometimes referred to as the 'Cinnamon Route.' The single or double outrigger is a typical feature of vessels of the seafaring Austronesians and the most likely vessel used for their voyages and exploration across Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Indian Ocean.[20] During this period, between 7th to 13th century in Indonesian archipelago flourished the Srivijaya thalassocracy empire that rule the maritime trade network in maritime Southeast Asia and connecting India and China.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Muslim period, in which the Muslims had dominated the trade across the Indian Ocean, the Gujaratis were bringing spices from the Moluccas as well as silk from China, in exchange for manufactured items such as textiles, and then selling them to the Egyptians and Arabs.[21] Calicut was the center of Indian pepper exports to the Red Sea and Europe at this time[21] with Egyptian and Arab traders being particularly active.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Madagascar, merchants and slave traders from the Middle East (Shirazi Persians, Omani Arabs, Arabized Jews, accompanied by Bantus from southeast Africa) and from Asia (Gujarat Indians, Malays, Javanese, Bugis) were sometimes integrated within the indigenous Malagasy clans [22][23]  New waves of Austronesian migrants arrived in Madagascar at this time leaving behind a lasting cultural and genetic legacy.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese fleets under Zheng He criscrossed the Indian Ocean during the early part of the 15th century. The missions were diplomatic rather than commercial, but many exchanges of gift and produces were made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Portuguese under Vasco da Gama discovered a naval route to the Indian Ocean through the southern tip of Africa in 1497ÿ98. Initially, the Portuguese were mainly active in Calicut, but the northern region of Gujarat was even more important for trade, and an essential intermediary in east-west trade.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nVenetian interests were directly threatened as the traditional trade patterns were eliminated and the Portuguese became able to undersell the Venetians in the spice trade in Europe. Venice broke diplomatic relations with Portugal and started to look at ways to counter its intervention in the Indian Ocean, sending an ambassador to the Egyptian court.[25] Venice negotiated for Egyptian tariffs to be lowered to facilitate competition with the Portuguese, and suggested that \\"rapid and secret remedies\\" be taken against the Portuguese.[25] The Mamluks sent a fleet in 1507 under Amir Husain Al-Kurdi, which would fight in the Battle of Chaul.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ottomans tried to challenge Portugal's hegemony in the Persian Gulf region by sending an armada against the Portuguese under Ali Bey in 1581. They were supported in this endeavor by the chiefs of several local principalities and port towns such as Muscat, Gwadar, and Pasni. However, the Portuguese successfully intercepted and destroyed the Ottoman Armada. Subsequently, the Portuguese attacked Gwadar and Pasni on the Mekran Coast and sacked them in retaliation for providing aid and comfort to the enemy.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 16th century the Portuguese had established bases in the Persian Gulf. In 1602, the Iranian army under the command of Imam-Quli Khan Undiladze managed to expel the Portuguese from Bahrain. In 1622, with the help of four English ships, Abbas retook Hormuz from the Portuguese in the capture of Ormuz. He replaced it as a trading centre with a new port, Bandar Abbas, nearby on the mainland, but it never became as successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, Japanese ships also made forays into Indian Ocean trade through the Red Seal ship \\r\\nsystem.","input":"When did the indian ocean trade route began?"},{"output":"Fort Lee, New Jersey","context":"The cinema of the United States, often metonymously referred to as Hollywood, has had a profound effect on the film industry in general since the early 20th century. The dominant style of American cinema is classical Hollywood cinema, which developed from 1917 to 1960 and characterizes most films made there to this day. While Frenchmen Auguste and Louis Lumire are generally credited with the birth of modern cinema,[7] American cinema quickly came to be the most dominant force in the industry as it emerged. Since the 1920s, the film industry of the United States has had higher annual grosses than any other country's.[citation needed] It produces the largest number of films of any single-language national cinema, with more than 800 English-language films released on average every year.[8] While the national cinemas of the United Kingdom (299), Canada (206), and Australia and New Zealand also produce films in the same language, they are not considered part of the Hollywood system. Hollywood has also been considered a transnational cinema.[9] Classical Hollywood produced multiple language versions of some titles, often in Spanish or French.

It produced the worlds first sound as well as musical film The Jazz Singer.[11]\\r\\nIn 1878, Eadweard Muybridge demonstrated the power of photography to capture motion. In 1894, the world's first commercial motion-picture exhibition was given in New York City, using Thomas Edison's kinetoscope. The United States produced the worlds first sync-sound musical film, The Jazz Singer, in 1927,[12] and was at the forefront of sound-film development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the US film industry has largely been based in and around the 30 Mile Zone in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Director D. W. Griffith was central to the development of a film grammar. Orson Welles's Citizen Kane (1941) is frequently cited in critics' polls as the greatest film of all time.[13]\\r\\nThe major film studios of Hollywood are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket selling movies in the world, such as The Birth of a Nation (1915), Gone with the Wind (1939), The Ten Commandments (1956), The Sound of Music (1965), Jaws (1975), Star Wars (1977), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Jurassic Park (1993), Titanic (1997), The Dark Knight (2008), Avatar (2009), The Avengers (2012) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Moreover, many of Hollywood's highest-grossing movies have generated more box-office revenue and ticket sales outside the United States than films made elsewhere. Today, American film studios collectively generate several hundred movies every year, making the United States one of the most prolific producers of films in the world and a leading pioneer in motion picture engineering and technology.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first recorded instance of photographs capturing and reproducing motion was a series of photographs of a running horse by Eadweard Muybridge, which he took in Palo Alto, California using a set of still cameras placed in a row. Muybridge's accomplishment led inventors everywhere to attempt to make similar devices. In the United States, Thomas Edison was among the first to produce such a device, the kinetoscope.\\r\\nThe history of cinema in the United States can trace its roots to the East Coast where, at one time, Fort Lee, New Jersey was the motion-picture capital of America. The industry got its start at the end of the 19th century with the construction of Thomas Edison's \\"Black Maria\\", the first motion-picture studio in West Orange, New Jersey. The cities and towns on the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades offered land at costs considerably less than New York City across the river and benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the 20th century.[14][15][16]\\r\\nThe industry began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce, and when the Kalem Company began using Fort Lee in 1907 as a location for filming in the area, other filmmakers quickly followed. In 1909, a forerunner of Universal Studios, the Champion Film Company, built the first studio.[17] They were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in Fort Lee. In the 1910s and 1920s, film companies such as the Independent Moving Pictures Company, Peerless Studios, The Solax Company, clair Studios, Goldwyn Picture Corporation, American Mlis (Star Films), World Film Company, Biograph Studios, Fox Film Corporation, Path Frres, Metro Pictures Corporation, Victor Film Company, and Selznick Pictures Corporation were all making pictures in Fort Lee. Such notables as Mary Pickford got their start at Biograph Studios.[18][19][20]\\r\\nIn New York, the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, was built during the silent film era, was used by the Marx Brothers and W.C. Fields. The Edison Studios were located in the Bronx. Chelsea, Manhattan was also frequently used. Picture City, Florida was also a planned site for a movie picture production center in the 1920s, but due to the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, the idea collapsed and Picture City returned to its original name of Hobe Sound. Other major centers of film production also included Chicago, Texas, California, and Cuba.\\r\\nThe film patents wars of the early 20th century led to the spread of film companies across the US Many worked with equipment for which they did not own the rights and thus filming in New York could be dangerous; it was close to Edison's Company headquarters, and to agents the company set out to seize cameras. By 1912, most major film companies had set up production facilities in Southern California near or in Los Angeles because of the region's favorable year-round weather.[21]\\r\\nIn early 1910, director D. W. Griffith was sent by the Biograph Company to the west coast with his acting troupe, consisting of actors Blanche Sweet, Lillian Gish, Mary Pickford, Lionel Barrymore and others. They started filming on a vacant lot near Georgia Street in downtown Los Angeles. While there, the company decided to explore new territories, traveling several miles north to Hollywood, a little village that was friendly and enjoyed the movie company filming there. Griffith then filmed the first movie ever shot in Hollywood, In Old California, a Biograph melodrama about California in the 19th century, when it belonged to Mexico. Griffith stayed there for months and made several films before returning to New York. After hearing about Griffith's success in Hollywood, in 1913, many movie-makers headed west to avoid the fees imposed by Thomas Edison, who owned patents on the movie-making process.[22] Nestor Studios of Bayonne, New Jersey, built the first studio in Hollywood in 1911.[23] Nestor Studios, owned by David and William Horsley, later merged with Universal Studios; and William Horsley's other company, Hollywood Film Laboratory, is now the oldest existing company in Hollywood, now called the Hollywood Digital Laboratory. California's more hospitable and cost-effective climate led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the West Coast by the 1930s. At the time, Thomas Edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production and movie producers on the East Coast acting independently of Edison's Motion Picture Patents Company were often sued or enjoined by Edison and his agents while movie makers working on the West Coast could work independently of Edison's control.[24]\\r\\nIn Los Angeles, the studios and Hollywood grew. Before World War I, movies were made in several US cities, but filmmakers tended to gravitate towards southern California as the industry developed. They were attracted by the warm climate and reliable sunlight, which made it possible to film movies outdoors year-round and by the varied scenery that was available. There are several starting points for cinema (particularly American cinema), but it was Griffith's controversial 1915 epic Birth of a Nation that pioneered the worldwide filming vocabulary that still dominates celluloid to this day.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, when the medium was new, many Jewish immigrants found employment in the US film industry. They were able to make their mark in a brand-new business: the exhibition of short films in storefront theaters called nickelodeons, after their admission price of a nickel (five cents). Within a few years, ambitious men like Samuel Goldwyn, William Fox, Carl Laemmle, Adolph Zukor, Louis B. Mayer, and the Warner Brothers (Harry, Albert, Samuel, and Jack) had switched to the production side of the business. Soon they were the heads of a new kind of enterprise: the movie studio. (It is worth noting that the US had at least one female director, producer and studio head in these early years: French-born director Alice Guy-Blach.) They also set the stage for the industry's internationalism; the industry is often accused of Amero-centric provincialism.\\r\\nOther moviemakers arrived from Europe after World War I: directors like Ernst Lubitsch, Alfred Hitchcock, Fritz Lang and Jean Renoir; and actors like Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich, Ronald Colman, and Charles Boyer. They joined a homegrown supply of actors? lured west from the New York City stage after the introduction of sound films? to form one of the 20th century's most remarkable growth industries. At motion pictures' height of popularity in the mid-1940s, the studios were cranking out a total of about 400 movies a year, seen by an audience of 90 million Americans per week.[25]\\r\\nSound also became widely used in Hollywood in the late 1920s.[26] After The Jazz Singer, the first film with synchronized voices was successfully released as a Vitaphone talkie in 1927, Hollywood film companies would respond to Warner Bros. and begin to use Vitaphone sound? which Warner Bros. owned until 1928 ÿ in future films. By May 1928, Electrical Research Product Incorporated (ERPI), a subsidiary of the Western Electric company, gained a monopoly over film sound distribution.[25]\\r\\nA side effect of the \\"talkies\\" was that many actors who had made their careers in silent films suddenly found themselves out of work, as they often had bad voices or could not remember their lines. Meanwhile, in 1922, US politician Will H. Hays left politics and formed the movie studio boss organization known as the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (MPPDA).[27] The organization became the Motion Picture Association of America after Hays retired in 1945.\\r\\nIn the early times of talkies, American studios found that their sound productions were rejected in foreign-language markets and even among speakers of other dialects of English. The synchronization technology was still too primitive for dubbing. One of the solutions was creating parallel foreign-language versions of Hollywood films. Around 1930, the American companies[which?] opened a studio in Joinville-le-Pont, France, where the same sets and wardrobe and even mass scenes were used for different time-sharing crews.\\r\\nAlso, foreign unemployed actors, playwrights, and winners of photogenia contests were chosen and brought to Hollywood, where they shot parallel versions of the English-language films. These parallel versions had a lower budget, were shot at night and were directed by second-line American directors who did not speak the foreign language. The Spanish-language crews included people like Luis Bu?uel, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Xavier Cugat, and Edgar Neville. The productions were not very successful in their intended markets, due to the following reasons:\\r\\nIn spite of this, some productions like the Spanish version of Dracula compare favorably with the original. By the mid-1930s, synchronization had advanced enough for dubbing to become usual.\\r\\nClassical Hollywood cinema is defined as a technical and narrative style characteristic of film from 1917 to 1960. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, which lasted from the end of the silent era in American cinema in the late 1920s to the early 1960s, thousands of movies were issued from the Hollywood studios. The start of the Golden Age was arguably when The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, ending the silent era and increasing box-office profits for films as sound was introduced to feature films.\\r\\nMost Hollywood pictures adhered closely to a formula?ÿ Western, slapstick comedy, musical, animated cartoon, biographical film (biographical picture)?ÿ and the same creative teams often worked on films made by the same studio. For example, Cedric Gibbons and Herbert Stothart always worked on MGM films, Alfred Newman worked at 20th Century Fox for twenty years, Cecil B. De Mille's films were almost all made at Paramount, and director Henry King's films were mostly made for 20th Century Fox.\\r\\nAt the same time, one could usually guess which studio made which film, largely because of the actors who appeared in it; MGM, for example, claimed it had contracted \\"more stars than there are in heaven.\\" Each studio had its own style and characteristic touches which made it possible to know this?ÿ a trait that does not exist today.\\r\\nFor example, To Have and Have Not (1944) is famous not only for the first pairing of actors Humphrey Bogart (1899ÿ1957) and Lauren Bacall (1924ÿ2014), but also for being written by two future winners of the Nobel Prize in Literature: Ernest Hemingway (1899ÿ1961), the author of the novel on which the script was nominally based, and William Faulkner (1897ÿ1962), who worked on the screen adaptation.\\r\\nAfter The Jazz Singer was released in 1927, Warner Bros. gained huge success and were able to acquire their own string of movie theaters, after purchasing Stanley Theaters and First National Productions in 1928. MGM had also owned the Loews string of theaters since forming in 1924, and the Fox Film Corporation owned the Fox Theatre strings as well. Also, RKO (a 1928 merger between Keith-Orpheum Theaters and the Radio Corporation of America[28]) responded to the Western Electric/ERPI monopoly over sound in films, and developed their own method, known as Photophone, to put sound in films.[25]\\r\\nParamount, which already acquired Balaban and Katz in 1926, would answer to the success of Warner Bros. and RKO, and buy a number of theaters in the late 1920s as well, and would hold a monopoly on theaters in Detroit, Michigan.[29] By the 1930s, almost all of the first-run metropolitan theaters in the United States were owned by the Big Five studios ÿ MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, Warner Bros., and 20th Century Fox.[30]\\r\\nMovie-making was still a business, however, and motion picture companies made money by operating under the studio system. The major studios kept thousands of people on salary? actors, producers, directors, writers, stunt men, craftspersons, and technicians. They owned or leased Movie Ranches in rural Southern California for location shooting of westerns and other large-scale genre films. And they owned hundreds of theaters in cities and towns across the nation in 1920 film theaters that showed their films and that were always in need of fresh material.\\r\\nIn 1930, MPPDA President Will Hays created the Hays (Production) Code, which followed censorship guidelines and went into effect after government threats of censorship expanded by 1930.[31] However, the code was never enforced until 1934, after the Catholic watchdog organization The Legion of Decency ÿ appalled by some of the provocative films and lurid advertising of the era later classified Pre-Code Hollywood- threatened a boycott of motion pictures if it didn't go into effect.[32] Those films that didn't obtain a seal of approval from the Production Code Administration had to pay a $25,000 fine and could not profit in the theaters, as the MPPDA controlled every theater in the country through the Big Five studios.\\r\\nThroughout the 1930s, as well as most of the golden age, MGM dominated the film screen and had the top stars in Hollywood, and was also credited for creating the Hollywood star system altogether.[33] Some MGM stars included \\"King of Hollywood\\" Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Jeanette MacDonald and husband Gene Raymond, Spencer Tracy, Judy Garland, and Gene Kelly.[33] But MGM did not stand alone. Another great achievement of US cinema during this era came through Walt Disney's animation company. In 1937, Disney created the most successful film of its time, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[34] This distinction was promptly topped in 1939 when Selznick International created what is still when adjusted for inflation, the most successful film of all time, Gone with the Wind.[35]\\r\\nMany film historians have remarked upon the many great works of cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was possible is that, with so many movies being made, not everyone had to be a big hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: Citizen Kane, directed by Orson Welles (1915ÿ1985) and often regarded as the greatest film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like Howard Hawks (1896ÿ1977), Alfred Hitchcock (1899ÿ1980), and Frank Capra (1897ÿ1991) battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions.\\r\\nThe apogee of the studio system may have been the year 1939, which saw the release of such classics as The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, Stagecoach, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Only Angels Have Wings, Ninotchka and Midnight. Among the other films from the Golden Age period that are now considered to be classics: Casablanca, It's a Wonderful Life, It Happened One Night, the original King Kong, Mutiny on the Bounty, Top Hat, City Lights, Red River, The Lady from Shanghai, Rear Window, On the Waterfront, Rebel Without a Cause, Some Like It Hot, and The Manchurian Candidate.\\r\\nThe studio system and the Golden Age of Hollywood succumbed to two forces that developed in the late 1940s:\\r\\nIn 1938, Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was released during a run of lackluster films from the major studios, and quickly became the highest grossing film released to that point. Embarrassingly for the studios, it was an independently produced animated film that did not feature any studio-employed stars.[36] This stoked already widespread frustration at the practice of block-booking, in which studios would only sell an entire year's schedule of films at a time to theaters and use the lock-in to cover for releases of mediocre quality.\\r\\nAssistant Attorney General Thurman Arnolda noted \\"trust buster\\" of the Roosevelt administration? took this opportunity to initiate proceedings against the eight largest Hollywood studios in July 1938 for violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.[37][38] The federal suit resulted in five of the eight studios (the \\"Big Five\\": Warner Bros., MGM, Fox, RKO and Paramount) reaching a compromise with Arnold in October 1940 and signing a consent decree agreeing to, within three years:\\r\\nThe \\"Little Three\\" (Universal Studios, United Artists, and Columbia Pictures), who did not own any theaters, refused to participate in the consent decree.[37][38] A number of independent film producers were also unhappy with the compromise and formed a union known as the Society of Independent Motion Picture Producers and sued Paramount for the monopoly they still had over the Detroit Theaters? as Paramount was also gaining dominance through actors like Bob Hope, Paulette Goddard, Veronica Lake, Betty Hutton, crooner Bing Crosby, Alan Ladd, and longtime actor for studio Gary Cooper too- by 1942. The Big Five studios didn't meet the requirements of the Consent of Decree during WWII, without major consequence, but after the war ended they joined Paramount as defendants in the Hollywood anti-trust case, as did the Little Three studios.[39]\\r\\nThe Supreme Court eventually ruled that the major studios ownership of theaters and film distribution was a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. As a result, the studios began to release actors and technical staff from their contracts with the studios. This changed the paradigm of film making by the major Hollywood studios, as each could have an entirely different cast and creative team.\\r\\nThe decision resulted in the gradual loss of the characteristics which made Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures, RKO Pictures, and 20th Century Fox films immediately identifiable. Certain movie people, such as Cecil B. DeMille, either remained contract artists till the end of their careers or used the same creative teams on their films so that a DeMille film still looked like one whether it was made in 1932 or 1956.\\r\\nAlso, the number of movies being produced annually dropped as the average budget soared, marking a major change in strategy for the industry. Studios now aimed to produce entertainment that could not be offered by television: spectacular, larger-than-life productions. Studios also began to sell portions of their theatrical film libraries to other companies to sell to television. By 1949, all major film studios had given up ownership of their theaters.\\r\\nTelevision was also instrumental in the decline of Hollywood's Golden Age as it broke the movie industry's hegemony in American entertainment. Despite this, the film industry was also able to gain some leverage for future films as longtime government censorship faded in the 1950s. After the Paramount anti-trust case ended, Hollywood movie studios no longer owned theaters and thus made it so foreign films could be released in American theaters without censorship.\\r\\nThis was complemented with the 1952 Miracle Decision in the Joseph Burstyn Inc. v Wilson case, in which the Supreme Court of the United States reversed its earlier position, from 1915's Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio case, and stated that motion pictures were a form of art and were entitled to the protection of the First amendment; US laws could no longer censor films. By 1968, with film studios becoming increasingly defiant to its censorship function, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) had replaced the Hays Codeÿwhich was now greatly violated after the government threat of censorship that justified the origin of the code had endedwith the film rating system.\\r\\nPost-classical cinema is the term used to describe the changing methods of storytelling in the New Hollywood. It has been argued that new approaches to drama and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired in the classical period: chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature \\"twist endings\\", and lines between the antagonist and protagonist may be blurred. The roots of post-classical storytelling may be seen in film noir, in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and in Hitchcock's storyline-shattering Psycho.\\r\\nThe New Hollywood describes the emergence of a new generation of film school-trained directors who had absorbed the techniques developed in Europe in the 1960s; The 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde marked the beginning of American cinema rebounding as well, as a new generation of films would afterwards gain success at the box offices as well.[40] Filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Brian De Palma, Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, and William Friedkin came to produce fare that paid homage to the history of film and developed upon existing genres and techniques. Inaugurated by the 1969 release of Andy Warhol's Blue Movie, the phenomenon of adult erotic films being publicly discussed by celebrities (like Johnny Carson and Bob Hope),[41] and taken seriously by critics (like Roger Ebert),[42][43] a development referred to, by Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times, as \\"porno chic\\", and later known as the Golden Age of Porn, began, for the first time, in modern American culture.[41][44][45] According to award-winning author Toni Bentley, Radley Metzger's 1976 film The Opening of Misty Beethoven, based on the play Pygmalion by George Bernard Shaw (and its derivative, My Fair Lady), and due to attaining a mainstream level in storyline and sets,[46] is considered the \\"crown jewel\\" of this 'Golden Age'.[47][48]\\r\\nIn the 1970s, the films of New Hollywood filmmakers were often both critically acclaimed and commercially successful. While the early New Hollywood films like Bonnie and Clyde and Easy Rider had been relatively low-budget affairs with amoral heroes and increased sexuality and violence, the enormous success enjoyed by Friedkin with The Exorcist, Spielberg with Jaws and Jurassic Park, Coppola with The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, Scorsese with Taxi Driver, Kubrick with 2001: A Space Odyssey, Polanski with Chinatown, and Lucas with American Graffiti and Star Wars, respectively helped to give rise to the modern \\"blockbuster\\", and induced studios to focus ever more heavily on trying to produce enormous hits.[49]\\r\\nThe increasing indulgence of these young directors did not help.[citation needed] Often, they'd go overschedule, and overbudget, thus bankrupting themselves or the studio.[citation needed] The three most famous examples of this are Coppola's Apocalypse Now and One From The Heart and particularly Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate, which single-handedly bankrupted United Artists. However, Apocalypse Now eventually made its money back and gained widespread recognition as a masterpiece, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes.[50]\\r\\nThe 1980s and 1990s saw another significant development. The full acceptance of home video by studios opened a vast new business to exploit. Films such as Showgirls, The Secret of NIMH, and The Shawshank Redemption, which may have performed poorly in their theatrical run, were now able to find success in the video market. It also saw the first generation of filmmakers with access to videotapes emerge. Directors such as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson had been able to view thousands of films and produced films with vast numbers of references and connections to previous works. Tarantino has had a number of collaborations with director Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez directed the 1992 action film El Mariachi, which was a commercial success after grossing $2 million against a budget of $7,000.\\r\\nThis, along with the explosion of independent film and ever-decreasing costs for filmmaking, changed the landscape of American movie-making once again and led a renaissance of filmmaking among Hollywood's lower and middle-classesthose without access to studio financial resources. With the rise of the DVD in the 21st century, DVDs have quickly become even more profitable to studios and have led to an explosion of packaging extra scenes, extended versions, and commentary tracks with the films.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe drive to produce a spectacle on the movie screen has largely shaped American cinema ever since.[citation needed] Spectacular epics which took advantage of new widescreen processes had been increasingly popular from the 1950s onwards. Since then, American films have become increasingly divided into two categories: Blockbusters and independent films.\\r\\nStudios have focused on relying on a handful of extremely expensive releases every year in order to remain profitable. Such blockbusters emphasize spectacle, star power, and high production value, all of which entail an enormous budget. Blockbusters typically rely upon star power and massive advertising to attract a huge audience.[citation needed] A successful blockbuster will attract an audience large enough to offset production costs and reap considerable profits.\\r\\nSuch productions carry a substantial risk of failure, and most studios release blockbusters that both over- and underperform in a year.[citation needed] Classic blockbusters from this period include Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Blade Runner, Scarface, Ghostbusters, The Terminator, The Goonies, Back to the Future, Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, Aliens, Lethal Weapon, Fatal Attraction, Wall Street, Rain Man, Die Hard, Driving Miss Daisy, Dances with Wolves, Goodfellas, Thelma & Louise, The Silence of the Lambs, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Unforgiven, The Bodyguard, The Fugitive, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Braveheart, Austin Powers, Titanic, Saving Private Ryan, American History X, Fight Club, The Matrix, The Green Mile, The Sixth Sense, American Beauty, Star Wars: Episode I ÿ The Phantom Menace, Gladiator, Gangs of New York, The Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Notebook, Million Dollar Baby, Little Miss Sunshine, The Departed and The Bourne Identity.[51]\\r\\nStudios supplement these movies with independent productions, made with small budgets and often independently of the studio corporation. Movies made in this manner typically emphasize high professional quality in terms of acting, directing, screenwriting, and other elements associated with production, and also upon creativity and innovation.[citation needed] These movies usually rely upon critical praise or niche marketing to garner an audience. Because of an independent film's low budget, a successful independent film can have a high profit-to-cost ratio while a failure will incur minimal losses, allowing for studios to sponsor dozens[citation needed] of such productions in addition to their high-stakes releases.\\r\\nAmerican independent cinema was revitalized[citation needed] in the late 1980s and early 1990s when another new generation of moviemakers, including Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino made movies like, respectively: Do the Right Thing, Sex, Lies, and Videotape, Clerks and Reservoir Dogs. In terms of directing, screenwriting, editing, and other elements, these movies were innovative and often irreverent, playing with and contradicting the conventions of Hollywood movies. Furthermore, their considerable financial successes and crossover into popular culture reestablished the commercial viability of independent film. Since then, the independent film industry has become more clearly defined and more influential in American cinema. Many of the major studios have capitalised on this by developing subsidiaries to produce similar films; for example, Fox Searchlight Pictures.\\r\\nTo a lesser degree in the early 21st century, film types that were previously considered[citation needed] to have only a minor presence in the mainstream movie market began to arise as more potent American box office draws. These include foreign-language films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero and documentary films such as Super Size Me, March of the Penguins, and Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine and Fahrenheit 9/11.\\r\\nIn the 1930s, the Democrats and the Republicans saw money in Hollywood. President Franklin Roosevelt saw a huge partnership with Hollywood. He used the first real potential of Hollywood's stars in a national campaign. Melvyn Douglas toured Washington in 1939 and met the key New Dealers.[citation needed]\\r\\nEndorsements letters from leading actors were signed, radio appearances and printed advertising were made. Movie stars were used to draw a large audience into the political view of the party. By the 1960s, John F. Kennedy was a new, young face for Washington, and his strong friendship with Frank Sinatra exemplified this new era of glamor. The last moguls of Hollywood were gone and younger, newer executives and producers began generating more liberal ideas.\\r\\nCelebrities and money attracted politicians into the high-class, glittering Hollywood lifestyle. As Ronald Brownstein wrote in his book \\"The Power and the Glitter\\", television in the 1970s and 1980s was an enormously important new media in politics and Hollywood helped in that media with actors making speeches on their political beliefs, like Jane Fonda against the Vietnam War.[53] This era saw former actor Ronald Reagan become Governor of California and subsequently become the 40th President of the United States. It continued with Arnold Schwarzenegger as California's Governor in 2003, and former reality star Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States.\\r\\nToday, Washington's interest is in Hollywood donations.[54] On February 20, 2007, for example, Barack Obama had a $2300-a-plate Hollywood gala, being hosted by DreamWorks founders David Geffen, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg at the Beverly Hilton.[54]\\r\\nIn 1912, American film companies were largely immersed in the competition for the domestic market. It was difficult to satisfy the huge demand for films created by the nickelodeon boom. Motion Picture Patents Company members such as Edison Studios, also sought to limit competition from French, Italian, and other imported films. Exporting films, then, became lucrative to these companies. Vitagraph Studios was the first American company to open its own distribution offices in Europe, establishing a branch in London in 1906, and a second branch in Paris shortly after.[55]\\r\\nOther American companies were moving into foreign markets as well, and American distribution abroad continued to expand until the mid-1920s. Originally, a majority of companies sold their films indirectly. However, since they were inexperienced in overseas trading, they simply sold the foreign rights to their films to foreign distribution firms or export agents. Gradually, London became a center for the international circulation of US films.[56]\\r\\nMany British companies made a profit by acting as the agents for this business, and by doing so, they weakened British production by turning over a large share of the UK market to American films. By 1911, approximately 60 to 70 percent of films imported into Great Britain were American. The United States was also doing well in Germany, Australia, and New Zealand.[57]\\r\\nMore recently, as globalization has started to intensify, and the United States government has been actively promoting free trade agendas and trade on cultural products, Hollywood has become a worldwide cultural source. The success on Hollywood export markets can be known not only from the boom of American multinational media corporations across the globe but also from the unique ability to make big-budget films that appeal powerfully to popular tastes in many different cultures.[58]\\r\\nWith globalization, movie production has been clustered in Hollywood for several reasons: the United States has the largest single home market in dollar terms, entertaining and highly visible Hollywood movies have global appeal, and the role of English as a universal language contributes to compensating for higher fixed costs of production.\\r\\nIn the meantime, Hollywood has moved more deeply into Chinese markets, although influenced by China's censorship. Films made in China are censored, strictly avoiding themes like \\"ghosts, violence, murder, horror, and demons.\\" Such plot elements risk being cut. Hollywood has had to make \\"approved\\" films, corresponding to official Chinese standards, but with aesthetic standards sacrificed to box office profits.

The island is part of the Commonwealth of Australia. Together with two neighbouring islands, it forms one of Australia's external territories. At the 2016 Australian census, it has 1,748 inhabitants living on a total area of about 35?km2 (14?sq?mi).[6] Its capital is Kingston.\\r\\nNorfolk Island was first settled by East Polynesians but was long unpopulated when it was eventually also settled by Great Britain as part of its settlement of Australia from 1788. The island served as a convict penal settlement from 6 March 1788 until 5 May 1855, except for an 11-year hiatus between 15 February 1814 and 6 June 1825,[8][9] when it lay abandoned. On 8 June 1856, permanent civilian residence on the island began when it was settled from Pitcairn Island. In 1914 the UK handed Norfolk Island over to Australia to administer as an external territory.[10]\\r\\nThe evergreen Norfolk Island pine is a symbol of the island and thus pictured on its flag. Native to the island, the pine is a key export for Norfolk Island, being a popular ornamental tree on mainland Australia, where two related species grow, and also worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNorfolk Island was settled by East Polynesian seafarers either from the Kermadec Islands north of New Zealand or from the North Island of New Zealand. They arrived in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and survived for several generations before disappearing.[11]\\r\\nThe first European known to have sighted and landed on the island was Captain James Cook, on 10 October 1774,[8][9] on his second voyage to the South Pacific on HMS Resolution. He named it after Mary Howard, Duchess of Norfolk (c. 1712ÿ1773).[12]\\r\\nSir John Call argued the advantages of Norfolk Island in that it was uninhabited and that New Zealand flax grew there. In 1786 the British government included Norfolk Island as an auxiliary settlement, as proposed by John Call, in its plan for colonisation of New South Wales. The decision to settle Norfolk Island was taken due to Empress Catherine II of Russia's decision to restrict sales of hemp. Practically all the hemp and flax required by the Royal Navy for cordage and sailcloth was imported from Russia.\\r\\nWhen the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in January 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of 15 convicts and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island and prepare for its commercial development. They arrived on 6 March 1788.\\r\\nDuring the first year of the settlement, which was also called \\"Sydney\\" like its parent, more convicts and soldiers were sent to the island from New South Wales.\\r\\nRobert Watson (1756-1819), harbourmaster, arrived with the First Fleet as quartermaster of H.M.S. Sirius, and was still serving in that capacity when the ship was wrecked at Norfolk Island in 1790. Next year he obtained and cultivated a grant of sixty acres (24 ha) on the island.[13]\\r\\nAs early as 1794, Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales Francis Grose suggested its closure as a penal settlement, as it was too remote and difficult for shipping and too costly to maintain.[14] The first group of people left in February 1805, and by 1808 only about 200 remained, forming a small settlement until the remnants were removed in 1813. A small party remained to slaughter stock and destroy all buildings, so that there would be no inducement for anyone, especially from other European powers, to visit and lay claim to the place. From 15 February 1814 to 6 June 1825 the island was abandoned.\\r\\nIn 1824 the British government instructed the Governor of New South Wales, Thomas Brisbane, to occupy Norfolk Island as a place to send \\"the worst description of convicts\\". Its remoteness, previously seen as a disadvantage, was now viewed as an asset for the detention of recalcitrant male prisoners. The convicts detained have long been assumed to be a hardcore of recidivists, or 'doubly-convicted capital respites' ÿ that is, men transported to Australia who committed fresh colonial crimes for which they were sentenced to death, but were spared the gallows on condition of life at Norfolk Island. However, a recent study, utilising a database of 6,458 Norfolk Island convicts, has demonstrated that the reality was somewhat different: more than half were detained at Norfolk Island without ever receiving a colonial conviction, and only 15% had been reprieved from a death sentence. Furthermore, the overwhelming majority of convicts sent to Norfolk Island had committed non-violent property offences, and the average length of detention there was three years.[15]\\r\\nThe second penal settlement began to be wound down by the British government after 1847, and the last convicts were removed to Tasmania in May 1855. The island was abandoned because transportation from the United Kingdom to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) had ceased in 1853, to be replaced by penal servitude in the UK.\\r\\nOn 8 June 1856, the next settlement began on Norfolk Island. These were the descendants of Tahitians and the HMS Bounty mutineers, including those of Fletcher Christian. They were resettled from the Pitcairn Islands, which had become too small for their growing population. On 3 May 1856, 193 people left Pitcairn Islands aboard the Morayshire.[16] On 8 June, 194 persons arrived, a baby having been born in transit.[17] The Pitcairners occupied many of the buildings remaining from the penal settlements, and gradually established traditional farming and whaling industries on the island. Although some families decided to return to Pitcairn in 1858 and 1863, the island's population continued to grow. They accepted additional settlers, who often arrived with whaling fleets.\\r\\nIn 1867, the headquarters of the Melanesian Mission of the Church of England was established on the island. In 1920 the Mission was relocated from Norfolk Island to the Solomon Islands to be closer to the population of focus.\\r\\nNorfolk Island was the subject of several experiments in administration during the century. It began the nineteenth century as part of the Colony of New South Wales. On 29 September 1844, Norfolk Island was transferred from of the Colony of New South Wales to the Colony of Van Diemen's Land.[18] On 1 November 1856 Norfolk Island was separated from the Colony of Tasmania (formerly Van Diemen's Land) and constituted as a \\"distinct and separate Settlement, the affairs of which should until further Order in that behalf by Her Majesty be administered by a Governor to be for that purpose appointed\\".[19][20] The Governor of New South Wales was constituted as the Governor of Norfolk Island.[21] On 19 March 1897 the office of the Governor of Norfolk Island was abolished and responsibility for the administration of Norfolk Island was vested in the Governor of the Colony of New South Wales. Yet, the island was not made a part of New South Wales and remained separate. The Colony of New South Wales ceased to exist upon the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901, and from that date responsibility for the administration of Norfolk Island was vested in the Governor of the State of New South Wales.[22]\\r\\nThe Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia accepted the territory by the Norfolk Island Act 1913 (Cth),[23][24] subject to British agreement; the Act received the assent on 19 December 1913. In preparation for the handover, a proclamation by the Governor of New South Wales on 23 December 1913 (in force when gazetted on 24 December) repealed \\"all laws heretofore in force in Norfolk Island\\" and replaced them by re-enacting a list of such laws.[25] Among those laws was the Administration Law 1913 (NSW), which provided for appointment of an Administrator of Norfolk Island and of magistrates, and contained a code of criminal law.[26]\\r\\nBritish agreement was expressed on 30 March 1914, in a UK Order in Council[27] made pursuant to the Australian Waste Lands Act 1855 (UK).[28][24] A proclamation by the Governor-General of Australia on 17 June 1914 gave effect to the Act and the Order as from 1 July 1914.[29][30]\\r\\nDuring World War II, the island became a key airbase and refuelling depot between Australia and New Zealand, and New Zealand and the Solomon Islands. The airstrip was constructed by Australian, New Zealand and United States servicemen during 1942.[31] Since Norfolk Island fell within New Zealand's area of responsibility, it was garrisoned by a New Zealand Army unit known as N Force at a large Army camp which had the capacity to house a 1,500 strong force. N Force relieved a company of the Second Australian Imperial Force. The island proved too remote to come under attack during the war and N Force left the island in February 1944.\\r\\nIn 1979, Norfolk Island was granted limited self-government by Australia, under which the island elected a government that ran most of the island's affairs.[32]\\r\\nIn 2006, a formal review process took place, in which the Australian government considered revising this model of government. The review was completed on 20 December 2006, when it was decided that there would be no changes in the governance of Norfolk Island.[33]\\r\\nFinancial problems and a reduction in tourism led to Norfolk Island's administration appealing to the Australian federal government for assistance in 2010. In return, the islanders were to pay income tax for the first time but would be eligible for greater welfare benefits.[34] However, by May 2013 agreement had not been reached and islanders were having to leave to find work and welfare.[35] An agreement was finally signed in Canberra on 12 March 2015 to replace self-government with a local council but against the wishes of the Norfolk Island government.[36][37] A majority of Norfolk Islanders objected to the Australian plan to make changes to Norfolk Island without first consulting them and allowing their say, with 68% of voters against forced changes.[38]\\r\\nOn 4 October 2015, Norfolk Island changed its time zone from UTC+11:30 to UTC+11:00.[39]\\r\\nIn March 2015, the Australian Government announced comprehensive reforms for Norfolk Island.[40] The action was justified on the grounds it was necessary \\"to address issues of sustainability which have arisen from the model of self-government requiring Norfolk Island to deliver local, state and federal functions since 1979\\".[40] On 17 June 2015, the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly was abolished, with the territory becoming run by an Administrator and an advisory council. Elections for a new Regional Council were held on 28 May 2016, with the new council taking office on 1 July 2016.[41]\\r\\nFrom that date, most Australian Commonwealth laws extend to Norfolk Island. This means that taxation, social security, immigration, customs and health arrangements apply on the same basis as in mainland Australia.[42] Travel between Norfolk Island and mainland Australia became domestic travel on 1 July 2016.[43] Norfolk Island residents also became eligible to vote in the ACT electorate of Canberra.\\r\\nSignificant opposition to the reforms has arisen in the territory led by Norfolk Island People for Democracy Inc., an association appealing to the United Nations to include the island on its list of \\"non-self governing territories\\".[44][45] There has also been movement to join New Zealand since the autonomy reforms.[46]\\r\\nThe Territory of Norfolk Island is located in the South Pacific Ocean, east of the Australian mainland. Norfolk Island itself is the main island of the island group that the territory encompasses and is located at 2902S 16757E? / ?29.033S 167.950E? / -29.033; 167.950. It has an area of 34.6 square kilometres (13.4?sq?mi), with no large-scale internal bodies of water and 32?km (20?mi) of coastline.\\r\\nThe island's highest point is Mount Bates (319 metres (1,047 feet) above sea level), located in the northwest quadrant of the island. The majority of the terrain is suitable for farming and other agricultural uses. Phillip Island, the second largest island of the territory, is located at 2907S 16757E? / ?29.117S 167.950E? / -29.117; 167.950, seven kilometres (4.3 miles) south of the main island.\\r\\nThe coastline of Norfolk Island consists, to varying degrees, of cliff faces. A downward slope exists towards Slaughter Bay and Emily Bay, the site of the original colonial settlement of Kingston. There are no safe harbour facilities on Norfolk Island, with loading jetties existing at Kingston and Cascade Bay. All goods not domestically produced are brought in by ship, usually to Cascade Bay. Emily Bay, protected from the Pacific Ocean by a small coral reef, is the only safe area for recreational swimming, although surfing waves can be found at Anson and Ball Bays.\\r\\nThe climate is subtropical and mild, with little seasonal differentiation. The island is the eroded remnant of a basaltic volcano active around 2.3 to 3?million years ago,[47] with inland areas now consisting mainly of rolling plains. It forms the highest point on the Norfolk Ridge, part of the submerged continent Zealandia.\\r\\nThe area surrounding Mount Bates is preserved as the Norfolk Island National Park. The park, covering around 10% of the land of the island, contains remnants of the forests which originally covered the island, including stands of subtropical rainforest.\\r\\nThe park also includes the two smaller islands to the south of Norfolk Island, Nepean Island and Phillip Island. The vegetation of Phillip Island was devastated due to the introduction during the penal era of pest animals such as pigs and rabbits, giving it a red-brown colour as viewed from Norfolk; however, pest control and remediation work by park staff has recently brought some improvement to the Phillip Island environment.\\r\\nThe major settlement on Norfolk Island is Burnt Pine, located predominantly along Taylors Road, where the shopping centre, post office, bottle shop, telephone exchange and community hall are located. Settlement also exists over much of the island, consisting largely of widely separated homesteads.\\r\\nGovernment House, the official residence of the Administrator, is located on Quality Row in what was the penal settlement of Kingston. Other government buildings, including the court, Legislative Assembly and Administration, are also located there. Kingston's role is largely a ceremonial one, however, with most of the economic impetus coming from Burnt Pine.\\r\\nAnson Bay on Norfolk Island.\\r\\nCaptain Cook lookout within the Norfolk Island National Park.\\r\\nAnson Bay, an attractive tourist spot\\r\\nSt Barnabas Chapel\\r\\nNorfolk Island has a marine subtropical climate (K?ppen climate classification: Cfa), which is best characterised as mild. The temperature almost never falls below 10?C (50?F) or rises above 26?C (79?F). The absolute maximum recorded temperature is 28.4?C (83.1?F), while the absolute minimum is 6.2?C (43.2?F).[48] Average annual precipitation is 1,328 millimetres (52.3?in),[31] with most rain falling from April to August. Other months receive significant amounts of precipitation as well.\\r\\nNorfolk Island has 174 native plants; 51 of them are endemic. At least 18 of the endemic species are rare or threatened.[49] The Norfolk Island palm (Rhopalostylis baueri) and the smooth tree-fern (Cyathea brownii), the tallest tree-fern in the world,[49] are common in the Norfolk Island National Park but rare elsewhere on the island. Before European colonization, most of Norfolk Island was covered with subtropical rain forest, the canopy of which was made of Araucaria heterophylla (Norfolk Island pine) in exposed areas, and the palm Rhopalostylis baueri and tree ferns Cyathea brownii and C. australis in moister protected areas. The understory was thick with lianas and ferns covering the forest floor. Only one small tract (5?km2) of rainforest remains, which was declared as the Norfolk Island National Park in 1986.[49]\\r\\nThis forest has been infested with several introduced plants. The cliffs and steep slopes of Mount Pitt supported a community of shrubs, herbaceous plants, and climbers. A few tracts of cliff top and seashore vegetation have been preserved. The rest of the island has been cleared for pasture and housing. Grazing and introduced weeds currently threaten the native flora, displacing it in some areas. In fact, there are more weed species than native species on Norfolk Island.[49]\\r\\nAs a relatively small and isolated oceanic island, Norfolk has few land birds but a high degree of endemicity among them. Many of the endemic species and subspecies have become extinct as a result of massive clearance of the island's native vegetation of subtropical rainforest for agriculture, hunting and persecution as agricultural pests. The birds have also suffered from the introduction of mammals such as rats, cats, pigs and goats, as well as from introduced competitors such as common blackbirds and crimson rosellas.[50]\\r\\nExtinctions include that of the endemic Norfolk kk and Norfolk ground dove along with endemic subspecies of pigeon, starling, triller, thrush and boobook owl, though the latter's genes persist in a hybrid population descended from the last female. Other endemic birds are the white-chested white-eye, which may be extinct, the Norfolk parakeet, the Norfolk gerygone, the slender-billed white-eye and endemic subspecies of the Pacific robin and golden whistler.[50]\\r\\nThe Norfolk Island Group Nepean Island is also home to breeding seabirds. The providence petrel was hunted to local extinction by the beginning of the 19th century, but has shown signs of returning to breed on Phillip Island. Other seabirds breeding there include the white-necked petrel, Kermadec petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Australasian gannet, red-tailed tropicbird and grey ternlet. The sooty tern (known locally as the whale bird) has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting by Norfolk Islanders.[51]\\r\\nNorfolk Island, with neighbouring Nepean Island, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of white-chested and slender-billed white-eyes, Norfolk parakeets and Norfolk gerygones, as well as over 1% of the world populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds. Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA.[50]\\r\\nNorfolk Island also has a botanical garden, which is home to a sizeable variety of plant species.[51] However, the island has only one native mammal, Gould's wattled bat (Chalinolobus gouldii). It is very rare, and may already be extinct on the island.\\r\\nThe Norfolk swallowtail (Papilio amynthor) is a species of butterfly that is found on Norfolk Island and the Loyalty Islands.[52]\\r\\nCetaceans were historically abundant around the island as commercial hunts on the island was operating until 1956. Today, numbers of larger whales have disappeared, but even today many species such humpback whale, minke whale, sei whale, and dolphins can be observed close to shore, and scientific surveys have been conducted regularly. Southern right whales were once regular migrants to Norfolk,[53] but were severely depleted by historical hunts, and further by recent illegal Soviet and Japanese whaling,[54] resulting in none or very few, if remnants still live, right whales in these regions along with Lord Howe Island.\\r\\nWhale sharks can be encountered off the island, too.\\r\\nGannet\\r\\nMasked boobies\\r\\nWhite tern\\r\\nEmily Bay\\r\\nNorfolk Island pines\\r\\nCaptain Cook Lookout\\r\\nBird Rock (off the north coast)\\r\\nCathedral Rock (off the north coast)\\r\\nThe population of Norfolk Island in the 2016 census was 1,748,[6] which had declined from a high of 2,601 in 2001.\\r\\nIn 2011, residents were 78 percent of the census count, with the remaining 22 percent being visitors. Sixteen percent of the population were 14?years and under, 54 percent were 15 to 64?years and 24 percent were 65?years and over. The figures showed an ageing population, with many people aged 20ÿ34 having moved away from the island.[55]\\r\\nMost islanders are of either European-only (mostly British) or combined European-Tahitian ancestry, being descendants of the Bounty mutineers as well as more recent arrivals from Australia and New Zealand. About half of the islanders can trace their roots back to Pitcairn Island.[56]\\r\\nThis common heritage has led to a limited number of surnames among the islanders  a limit constraining enough that the island's telephone directory also includes nicknames for many subscribers, such as Cane Toad, Dar Bizziebee, Lettuce Leaf, Goof, Paw Paw, Diddles, Rubber Duck, Carrots and Tarzan.[56][57]\\r\\nPopulation\\r\\nPopulation growth rate\\r\\nNationality\\r\\nEthnic groups\\r\\nSixty-two percent of islanders are Christians. After the death of the first chaplain Rev G. H. Nobbs in 1884, a Methodist church was formed and in 1891 a Seventh-day Adventist congregation led by one of Nobbs' sons. Some unhappiness with G. H. Nobbs, the more organised and formal ritual of the Church of England service arising from the influence of the Melanesian Mission, decline in spirituality, the influence of visiting American whalers, literature sent by Christians overseas impressed by the Pitcairn story, and the adoption of Seventh-day Adventism by the descendants of the mutineers still on Pitcairn, all contributed to these developments. The Roman Catholic Church began work in 1957 and in the late 1990s a group left the former Methodist (then Uniting Church) and formed a charismatic fellowship. In 2011, 34 percent of the ordinary residents identified as Anglican, 13 percent as Uniting Church, 12 percent as Roman Catholic and three percent as Seventh-day Adventist. Nine percent were from other religions. Twenty four percent had no religion, and seven percent did not indicate a religion.[55] Typical ordinary congregations in any church do not exceed 30 local residents as of 2010[update]. The three older denominations have good facilities. Ministers are usually short-term visitors.\\r\\nReligions[58]\\r\\nIslanders speak both English and a creole language known as Norfuk, a blend of 18th-century English and Tahitian. The Norfuk language is decreasing in popularity as more tourists travel to the island and more young people leave for work and study reasons; however, there are efforts to keep it alive via dictionaries and the renaming of some tourist attractions to their Norfuk equivalents. In 2004 an act of the Norfolk Island Assembly made it a co-official language of the island.[3][59][60] The act is long-titled: \\"An Act to recognise the Norfolk Island Language (Norf'k) as an official language of Norfolk Island\\". The \\"language known as 'Norf'k'\\" is described as the language \\"that is spoken by descendants of the first free settlers of Norfolk Island who were descendants of the settlers of Pitcairn Island\\". The act recognises and protects use of the language but does not require it; in official use, it must be accompanied by an accurate translation into English.[61][62] 32% of the total population reported speaking a language other than English in the 2011 census, and just under three-quarters of the ordinarily resident population could speak Norfuk.[55]\\r\\nLanguages[58]\\r\\nThe sole school on the island, Norfolk Island Central School, provides education from kindergarten through to Year 12. The school has a contractual arrangement referred to as a Memorandum of Understanding with the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities regarding the teaching staff of the school, the latest of which took effect in January 2015.[63] In 2015 enrolment at the Norfolk Island Central School was 282 students.[64]\\r\\nNo public tertiary education infrastructure exist on the Island. The Norfolk Island Central School works in partnership with Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) and local employers to support students accessing Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses.[65]\\r\\nLiteracy is not recorded officially, but can be assumed to be roughly at a par with Australia's literacy rate, as islanders attend a school which uses a New South Wales curriculum, before traditionally moving to the mainland for further study.\\r\\nWhile there was no \\"indigenous\\" culture on the island at the time of settlement, the Tahitian influence of the Pitcairn settlers has resulted in some aspects of Polynesian culture being adapted to that of Norfolk, including the hula dance. Local cuisine also shows influences from the same region.\\r\\nIslanders traditionally spend a lot of time outdoors, with fishing and other aquatic pursuits being common pastimes, an aspect which has become more noticeable as the island becomes more accessible to tourism. Most island families have at least one member involved in primary production in some form.\\r\\nDrivers on the island sometimes give the \\"Norfolk Wave\\", a wave to each other as they pass as a form of greeting.[66]\\r\\nReligious observance remains an important part of life for some islanders, particularly the older generations, but actual attendance is about 8% of the resident population plus some tourists. In the 2006 census 19.9% had no religion[67] compared with 13.2% in 1996.[68] Businesses are closed on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons and Sundays.[31]\\r\\nOne of the island's residents was the novelist Colleen McCullough, whose works include The Thorn Birds and the Masters of Rome series as well as Morgan's Run, set, in large part, on Norfolk Island.\\r\\nHelen Reddy also moved to the island for a period, and still maintains a house there.\\r\\nAmerican novelist James A. Michener, who served in the United States Navy during World War II, set one of the chapters of his episodic novel Tales of the South Pacific on Norfolk Island.\\r\\nThe island is one of the few locations outside North America to celebrate the holiday of Thanksgiving.[69]\\r\\nNorfolk Island is the only non-mainland Australian territory to have had self-governance. The Norfolk Island Act 1979, passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1979, is the Act under which the island was governed until the passing of the Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Act 2015. The Australian government maintains authority on the island through an Administrator, currently Eric Hutchinson.[70] From 1979 to 2015, a Legislative Assembly was elected by popular vote for terms of not more than three years, although legislation passed by the Australian Parliament could extend its laws to the territory at will, including the power to override any laws made by the assembly.\\r\\nThe Assembly consisted of nine seats, with electors casting nine equal votes, of which no more than two could be given to any individual candidate. It is a method of voting called a \\"weighted first past the post system\\". Four of the members of the Assembly formed the Executive Council, which devised policy and acted as an advisory body to the Administrator. The last Chief Minister of Norfolk Island was Lisle Snell. Other ministers included: Minister for Tourism, Industry and Development; Minister for Finance; Minister for Cultural Heritage and Community Services; and Minister for Environment.\\r\\nAll seats were held by independent candidates. Norfolk Island did not embrace party politics. In 2007 a branch of the Australian Labor Party was formed on Norfolk Island, with the aim of reforming the system of government.\\r\\nSince July 2016 after the loss of self-government, residents of Norfolk Island have been required to enrol in the Division of Canberra. As is the case for all Australian citizens, enrolment and voting for Norfolk Islanders is compulsory.[71]\\r\\nDisagreements over the island's relationship with Australia were put in sharper relief by a 2006 review undertaken by the Australian government.[33] Under the more radical of two models proposed in the review, the island's legislative assembly would have been reduced to the status of a local council.[56] However, in December 2006, citing the \\"significant disruption\\" that changes to the governance would impose on the island's economy, the Australian government ended the review leaving the existing governance arrangements unaltered.[72]\\r\\nIn a move that apparently surprised many islanders, the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its self-government status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts.[73]\\r\\nIt was announced on 19 March 2015 that self-governance for the island would be revoked by the Commonwealth and replaced by a local council with the state of New South Wales providing services to the island. A reason given was that the island had never gained self-sufficiency and was being heavily subsidised by the Commonwealth, by $12.5 million in 2015 alone. It meant that residents would have to start paying Australian income tax, but they would also be covered by Australian welfare schemes such as Centrelink and Medicare.[74]\\r\\nThe Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly decided to hold a referendum on the proposal. On 8 May 2015, voters were asked if Norfolk Islanders should freely determine their political status and their economic, social and cultural development, and to \\"be consulted at referendum or plebiscite on the future model of governance for Norfolk Island before such changes are acted upon by the Australian parliament\\".[75] 68% out of 912 voters voted in favour. The Norfolk Island Chief Minister, Lisle Snell, said that \\"the referendum results blow a hole in Canberra's assertion that the reforms introduced before the Australian Parliament that propose abolishing the Legislative Assembly and Norfolk Island Parliament were overwhelmingly supported by the people of Norfolk Island\\".[38]\\r\\nThe Norfolk Island Legislation Amendment Bill 2015 passed the Australian Parliament on 14 May 2015 (assented on 26 May 2015), abolishing self-government on Norfolk Island and transferring Norfolk Island into a council as part of New South Wales law.[76] From 1 July 2016 Norfolk Island legislation will be transferred to New South Wales and subject to NSW legislation.[77]\\r\\nThe island's official capital is Kingston; it is, however, more a centre of government than a sizeable settlement. The largest settlement is at Burnt Pine.\\r\\nThe most important local holiday is Bounty Day, celebrated on 8 June, in memory of the arrival of the Pitcairn Islanders in 1856.\\r\\nLocal ordinances and acts apply on the island, where most laws are based on the Australian legal system. Australian common law applies when not covered by either Australian or Norfolk Island law. Suffrage is universal at age eighteen.\\r\\nAs a territory of Australia, Norfolk Island does not have diplomatic representation abroad, or within the territory, and is also not a participant in any international organisations, other than sporting organisations.\\r\\nThe flag is three vertical bands of green, white, and green with a large green Norfolk Island pine tree centred in the slightly wider white band.\\r\\nNorfolk Island was originally a colony acquired by settlement but was never within the British Settlements Act.[78][79] It was accepted as a territory of Australia, separate from any state, by the Norfolk Island Act 1913 (Cth),[80] passed under the territories power (Constitution section 122) and made effective in 1914.[81] In 1976 the High Court of Australia held unanimously that Norfolk Island is a part of the Commonwealth.[82] Again, in 2007 the High Court of Australia affirmed the validity of legislation that made Australian citizenship a necessary qualification for voting for, and standing for election to, the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island.[83]\\r\\nThe Government of Australia thus holds that:\\r\\nNorfolk Island has had a limited form of self-government, established by the Norfolk Island Act 1979 (Cth).[85] This limited form of self-government has since been replaced by the Norfolk Island Advisory Council.[85]\\r\\nMuch of the self-government under the 1979 legislation was repealed with effect from 2016.[86] The reforms included, to the chagrin of some of the locals of Norfolk Island, a repeal of the preambular sections of the Act which originally were 3ÿ4 pages recognising the particular circumstances in the history of Norfolk Island.[87]\\r\\nConsistent with the Australian position, the United Nations Decolonization Committee[88] does not include Norfolk Island on its list of Non-Self-Governing Territories.\\r\\nThis legal position is disputed by some residents on the island. Some islanders claim that Norfolk Island was actually granted independence at the time Queen Victoria granted permission to Pitcairn Islanders to re-settle on the island.[89]\\r\\nFollowing reforms to the status of Norfolk Island there were mass protests by the local population.[90] In 2015 it was reported that Norfolk Island was taking its argument for self-governance to the United Nations.[91][92] A campaign to preserve the island's autonomy was formed, named Norfolk's Choice.[93] A formal petition was lodged with the United Nations by Geoffrey Robertson on behalf of the local population on 25 April 2016.[94]\\r\\nVarious suggestions for retaining the island's self-government have been proposed. In 2006 a UK MP, Andrew Rosindell, raised the possibility of the island becoming a self-governing British Overseas Territory.[95] In 2013 the island's last chief minister, Lisle Snell, suggested independence, to be supported by income from fishing, offshore banking and foreign aid.[96]\\r\\nThe island is subject to separate immigration controls from the remainder of Australia. Until recently immigration to Norfolk Island even by other Australian citizens was heavily restricted. In 2012, immigration controls were relaxed with the introduction of an Unrestricted Entry Permit[97] for all Australian and New Zealand citizens upon arrival and the option to apply for residency; the only criteria are to pass a police check and be able to pay into the local health scheme.[98] From 1 July 2016, the Australian migration system replaced the immigration arrangements previously maintained by the Norfolk Island Government.[99]\\r\\nAustralian citizens and residents from other parts of the nation now have automatic right of residence on the island after meeting these criteria (Immigration (Amendment No. 2) Act 2012). Australian citizens can carry either a passport or a form of photo identification to travel to Norfolk Island. The Document of Identity, which is no longer issued, is also acceptable within its validity period. Citizens of all other nations must carry a passport to travel to Norfolk Island even if arriving from other parts of Australia. Holders of Australian visas who travel to Norfolk Island have departed the Australian Migration Zone. Unless they hold a multiple-entry visa, the visa will have ceased; in which case they will require another visa to re-enter mainland Australia.[97][100]\\r\\nNon-Australian citizens who are permanent residents of Norfolk Island may apply for Australian citizenship after meeting normal residence requirements and are eligible to take up residence in mainland Australia at any time through the use of a Confirmatory (Residence) visa (subclass 808).[101] Children born on Norfolk Island are Australian citizens as specified by Australian nationality law.\\r\\nNon-Australian citizens who are Australian permanent residents should be aware that during their stay on Norfolk Island they are \\"outside of Australia\\" for the purposes of the Migration Act. This means that not only will they need a still-valid migrant visa or Resident return visa to return from Norfolk Island to the mainland, but also the time spent in Norfolk Island will not be counted for satisfying the residence requirement for obtaining a Resident return visa in the future.[97] On the other hand, as far as Australian nationality law is concerned, Norfolk Island is a part of Australia, and any time spent by an Australian permanent resident on Norfolk Island will count as time spent in Australia for the purpose of applying for Australian citizenship.[102]\\r\\nNorfolk Island Hospital is the only medical centre on the island. From 1 July 2016, medical treatment on Norfolk Island is covered by Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as it is on mainland Australia. Emergency medical treatment is covered by Medicare or a private health insurer.[103] Although the hospital can perform minor surgery, serious medical conditions are not permitted to be treated on the island and patients are flown back to mainland Australia. Air charter transport can cost in the order of A$30,000, which is covered by the Australian Government. For serious emergencies, medical evacuations are provided by the Royal Australian Air Force. The island has one ambulance, staffed by St John Ambulance Australia volunteers.\\r\\nThe lack of medical facilities available in most remote communities has a major impact on the health care of Norfolk Islanders.[citation needed] As is consistent with other extremely remote regions many older residents find it impossible to remain on the island when their health falters, many have to leave their homes and live in New Zealand or Australia to get medical care.\\r\\nDefence is the responsibility of the Australian Defence Force. There are no active military installations or defence personnel on Norfolk Island. The Administrator may request the assistance of the Australian Defence Force if required.\\r\\nCivilian law enforcement and community policing is provided by the Australian Federal Police. The normal deployment to the island is one sergeant and two constables. These are augmented by five local Special Members who have police powers but are not AFP employees.\\r\\nThe Norfolk Island Court of Petty Sessions is the equivalent of a Magistrates Court and deals with minor criminal, civil or regulatory matters. The Chief Magistrate of Norfolk Island is usually the current Chief Magistrate of the Australian Capital Territory. Three local Justices of the Peace have the powers of a Magistrate to deal with minor matters.\\r\\nThe Supreme Court of Norfolk Island deals with more serious criminal offences, more complex civil matters, administration of deceased estates and federal laws as they apply to the Territory. The Judges of the Supreme Court of Norfolk Island are generally appointed from among Justices of the Federal Court of Australia and may sit on the Australian mainland or convene a circuit court. Appeals are to the Federal Court of Australia.\\r\\nUntil 2016, Norfolk Island took its own censuses, separate from those taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the remainder of Australia.[104]\\r\\nAustralia Post sends and receives mail from Norfolk Island with the postcode 2899. With the merger of Norfolk Island as a regional council, the Norfolk Island Postal Service has ceased to exist and all postage is now handled by Australia Post.[105]\\r\\nTourism, the primary economic activity, has steadily increased over the years. As Norfolk Island prohibits the importation of fresh fruit and vegetables, most produce is grown locally. Beef is both produced locally and imported. The island has one winery, Two Chimneys Wines.[106]\\r\\nThe Australian government controls the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and revenue from it extending 200 nautical miles (370?km) around Norfolk Island (roughly 428,000km2) and territorial sea claims to three nautical miles (6?km) from the island. There is a strong belief on the island that some of the revenue generated from Norfolk's EEZ should be available to providing services such as health and infrastructure on the island, which the island has been responsible for, similar to how the Northern Territory is able to access revenue from their mineral resources.[107] The exclusive economic zone provides the islanders with fish, its only major natural resource. Norfolk Island has no direct control over any marine areas but has an agreement with the Commonwealth through the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) to fish \\"recreationally\\" in a small section of the EEZ known locally as \\"the Box\\". While there is speculation that the zone may include oil and gas deposits, this is not proven.[56] There are no major arable lands or permanent farmlands, though about 25 per cent of the island is a permanent pasture. There is no irrigated land. The island uses the Australian dollar as its currency.\\r\\nIn 2015 a company in Norfolk Island was granted a licence to export medicinal cannabis.[108] The medicinal cannabis industry has been viewed by some as a means of reinvigorating the economy of Norfolk Island. The Commonwealth stepped in to overturn the decision, with the island's administrator, former Liberal MP Gary Hardgrave revoking the local licence to grow the crop.[109] Legislation to allow the cultivation of cannabis in Australia for medical or scientific purposes passed Federal Parliament in February. The Victorian Government will be undertaking a small-scale, strictly controlled cannabis cultivation trial at a Victorian research facility.[110]\\r\\nFormerly, residents of Norfolk Island did not pay Australian federal taxes,[111] which created a tax haven for locals and visitors alike. There was no income tax so the island's legislative assembly raised money through an import duty, fuel levy, medicare levy, goods and services tax of 12%, and local/international phone calls.[56][111] The Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. The introduction of income taxation came into effect on 1 July 2016. There is a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool in order for the island to have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health, education, medicare, and infrastructure. Prior to these reforms residents of Norfolk Island were not entitled to social services.[112] It appears that the reforms do extend to companies and trustees and not only individuals.[113][114]\\r\\nAs of 2004[update], 2532 telephone main lines are in use, a mix of analog (2500) and digital (32) circuits.[4] Satellite communications services are planned.[citation needed] There is one locally based radio station (Radio Norfolk 89.9FM), broadcasting on both AM and FM frequencies. There is also one TV station, Norfolk TV, featuring local programming, plus transmitters for Australian channels ABC, SBS, Imparja Television and Southern Cross Television. The Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) is .nf.\\r\\nThere are no railways, waterways, ports or harbours on the island.[115] Loading jetties are located at Kingston and Cascade, but ships cannot get close to either of them. When a supply ship arrives, it is emptied by whaleboats towed by launches, five tonnes at a time. Which jetty is used depends on the prevailing weather of the day; the jetty on the leeward side of the island is often used. If the wind changes significantly during unloading/loading, the ship will move around to the other side. Visitors often gather to watch the activity when a supply ship arrives.[citation needed]\\r\\nThere is one airport, Norfolk Island Airport.[4] There are 80 kilometres (50?mi) of roads on the island (53?km (33?mi) paved, 27?km (17?mi) unpaved); however, local law gives cows the right of way.[56] Speed limits are low: 50?km/h (31?mph) maximum in the territory, 40?km/h (25?mph) in town and 30?km/h (19?mph) near schools.[116]\\r\\nSee main articles\\r\\nCoordinates: 2920S 167570E? / ?29.03333S 167.95000E? / -29.03333; 167.95000\\r\\nGovernment\\r\\nGeneral information\\r\\nTravel\\r\\nArchaeology and Polynesian settlement in prehistory\\r\\nOthers","input":"When did norfolk island became part of australia?"},{"output":"singer","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Lance Bass (/b?s/; born May 4, 1979)[3] is an American singer, dancer, actor, film and television producer, and author. He grew up in Mississippi and rose to fame as the bass singer for the American pop boy band NSYNC. NSYNC's success led Bass to work in film and television. He starred in the 2001 film On the Line, which his company, Bacon & Eggs, also produced.[4] Bass later formed a second production company, Lance Bass Productions,[5] as well as a now-defunct music management company, Free Lance Entertainment, a joint venture with Mercury Records.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completion of NSYNC's PopOdyssey Tour, Bass moved to Star City, Russia, in much publicized pursuit of a seat on a Soyuz space capsule.[5] Bass was certified by both NASA and the Russian Space Program after several months of cosmonaut training,[5] and planned to join the TMA-1 mission to the International Space Station.[7] However, after his financial sponsors backed out, Bass was denied a seat on the mission.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn July 2006, Bass revealed that he is gay in a cover story for People magazine.[9] He was awarded the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award in October 2006,[10] and released an autobiography, Out of Sync, in October 2007, which debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nJames Lance Bass was born in Laurel, Mississippi, to James Irvin Bass, Jr., a medical technologist, and Diane (ne Pulliam), a middle school mathematics, English, and career discovery teacher.[1][12] Along with his older sister, Stacy, Bass grew up in adjacent Ellisville, Mississippi, and was raised as a Southern Baptist.[13][14] Bass has described his family as devoutly Christian and conservative[15] and has said that his childhood was \\"extremely happy\\".[1] As a young boy, Bass developed an interest in space, and at age 9 traveled to Cape Canaveral, Florida, with his father to watch his first live space shuttle launch. Of this experience Bass said, \\"I was certain from then on that my future was to be involved with space.\\"[16] Shortly after, Bass attended space camp in Titusville, Florida,[17] and aspired to attend college and study engineering, with the hope that he would one day work for NASA.[18][19]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Bass was 11 years old, his father was transferred to a different hospital, and the family moved to Clinton, Mississippi[1] Bass began singing in his Baptist church choir, and was encouraged to audition for local performance groups by his childhood best friend, Darren Dale,[20] the youngest child of former longtime Mississippi Insurance Commissioner George Dale. Bass joined the Mississippi Show Stoppers, a statewide music group sponsored by the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, and the Attach Show Choir, a national-award-winning competitive show choir group at Clinton High School. He was also a member of a seven-man vocal group named Seven Card Stud, which competed at state fairs and performed at several social and political events for Senator Trent Lott.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Clinton High School, Bass was elected vice president of his junior class[20] and has said that he performed well in math and science.[13][21] However, Bass later stated that his primary focus during high school was singing, and when looking back, he remembers \\"hardly anything\\" about academia.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass's music career has consisted primarily of his singing with NSYNC and running a small management company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, during his junior year of high school, Bass received a call from Justin Timberlake and his mother, Lynn Harless, who asked Bass if he would be interested in auditioning for the pop group NSYNC after the group's original bass singer, Jason Galasso, had quit.[22] Timberlake's vocal coach (who had worked with Bass during his time as a Mississippi Show Stopper) recommended Bass as a replacement.[13][18][23] Bass was accepted into the group after auditioning in front of the other bandmembers and Lou Pearlman, and soon left school to move to Orlando, Florida, and rehearse full-time.[24] Bass has said that he did not know how to dance before he joined NSYNC, and therefore found much of the group's choreography difficult to learn.[18] According to an episode of VH1's Driven, Jan Boltz, president of BMG's German division, offered NSYNC a recording contract under the condition that they replace Bass, whose dancing, he felt, \\"wasn't at the same level as all the others.\\"[22] However, the other members of the group refused to accept the contract without Bass, and the group's manager, Johnny Wright, convinced Bolz that Bass's dancing would quickly improve.[22] Bolz conceded, and the group soon moved to Munich, Germany to record their first album with BMG.[24] 'N Sync began extensive touring in Europe, and Bass's mother quit her job to tour with the group as a chaperone, as Bass was still a minor.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter gaining significant notability in Europe, NSYNC was signed to American record label RCA in 1997.[24] The group's first single, \\"I Want You Back\\" began receiving major radio play in the United States, and NSYNC soon found themselves becoming an \\"overnight sensation\\", a period which Bass describes in his autobiography as \\"the death of my own innocence\\".[24] Along with increasing fame and recognition in the United States the band also experienced a highly publicized legal battle with Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part.[25] NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for defrauding the group of more than 50% of their earnings, rather than his original promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits.[25] The group threatened to leave and sign with Jive Records, which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for $150?million US, citing breach of contract.[26] The injunction was thrown out of court[25] and, after winning back their earnings, NSYNC signed with Jive.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 2000, NSYNC released No Strings Attached, which became the fastest-selling record of all time,[28] selling 1.1?million copies in its first day of release.[23] In 2001, the group followed up with their Celebrity album,[29] which scored the second highest first-week album sales ever, trumped only by the group's previous album.[30] NSYNC went on to sell over 56 million records worldwide.[31] In 2002, the group announced that they would be taking a \\"hiatus\\", during which Timberlake began to record solo material.[32] 'N Sync has not recorded new material since, and Bass has stated that he feels the group has officially disbanded.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2007, Bass stated that he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 decision to pursue his solo career instead.[32] Bass has also said that he has little hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has \\"made it clear that he wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon.\\"[33] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: \\"At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I'm really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don't hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us.\\"[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Bass formed a music management company named Free Lance Entertainment, which was a joint venture with Mercury Nashville, a division of Mercury Records.[6] Vowing to keep the company \\"a strictly family-run operation,\\" Bass employed his parents and sister as talent scouts, and recruited childhood friend and aspiring country singer Meredith Edwards for the company's first release.[34] Edwards began touring with NSYNC as an opening act in the fall of 2000,[34] and Bass teamed up with MTV to hold a nationwide talent search for more artists later that year.[35] However, Free Lance soon folded after disappointing sales of Edwards's debut album, Reach.[35][36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass guest-starred on the WB drama series 7th Heaven, playing Rick Palmer, a love interest for Beverley Mitchell's character, Lucy.[37] The following year, while NSYNC was in the midst of recording Celebrity, Bass received his first starring role in the 2001 motion picture On The Line.[38] Bass played Kevin, a man who falls in love with a woman on a Chicago train and begins a search to find her again. The film was produced by Bass's production company, A Happy Place (later renamed Bacon & Eggs), and featured appearances by Jerry Stiller, Al Green, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, former WWE wrestler Chyna, and Bass's bandmates Timberlake, Kirkpatrick and Fatone, the latter in a major role.[38] The film also featured a soundtrack which included previously unreleased songs by NSYNC and Britney Spears. Bass collaborated with Joey Fatone, Mandy Moore, Christian Burns and True Vibe (as the \\"On The Line Allstars\\") for the film's theme song, \\"On The Line\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite heavy marketing towards NSYNC teen fans, the film was a commercial failure, grossing only $4.2?million US domestically despite its $10?million US budget.[40] The film, along with Bass's acting, was also poorly received by critics.[40] Bass later said that he felt the film's success was greatly hindered by its release date, which came one week after the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001. In his 2007 autobiography, Bass wrote, \\"That was it?ÿ our film was finished... once the country went to war, there was no way our film was going to be on anyone's top-priority list.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter On The Line, Bass appeared in Zoolander and Wes Craven's Cursed as himself, and played a wedding singer in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry.[42] Bass has also lent his voice to several animated television programs, such as Robot Chicken and Disney's Kim Possible, Handy Manny and Higglytown Heroes.[43] In the video game realm, Bass voiced the Final Fantasy VII character Sephiroth in Kingdom Hearts.[43] On August 14, 2007, Bass began a six-month stint playing Corny Collins in the Broadway musical Hairspray, coinciding with the play's five-year stage anniversary.[44] He ended his run in Hairspray on January 6, 2008.[44] Bass made an appearance in the 2008 film Tropic Thunder. As a guest star in the 2013 Gravity Falls episode \\"Boyz Crazy\\", Bass plays in the boy band, Sev'ral Timez (which is a parody of NSYNC). In 2014, Bass guest starred on an episode of the Comedy Central series, Review, in which he visited space along with the show's lead character.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, Bass joined season two of The Meredith Vieira Show as a full-time contributing panelist.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass and his mother competed with other duos in the FOX reality cooking series My Kitchen Rules.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass was a contestant on Season 7 of Dancing with the Stars, and was paired with swing dance champ Lacey Schwimmer. Bass and Schwimmer reached the grand finale in competition with Brooke Burke partnering with Derek Hough and Warren Sapp partnering with Kym Johnson. Lance Bass finished in third place[47] with the title going to Burke.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2001, Bass formed his first film production company, A Happy Place, with film producers Rich Hull, Wendy Thorlakson and Joe Anderson.[48] The company was geared towards family-friendly films,[37] and received the Movieguide award for \\"Excellence in Family-Oriented Programming\\" for its first feature film, On the Line.[49] After On The Line, A Happy Place changed its name to Bacon & Eggs[48] and produced its second feature film, Lovewrecked, in 2005. The film debuted on the ABC Family Channel in January 2007, and starred Amanda Bynes, Chris Carmack and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, with Bass in a minor role. This too received mostly negative reviews.\\r\\n\\r\\nBass later formed a separate production company named Lance Bass Productions.[5] On May 14, 2007, Brian Graden announced that Lance Bass Productions would be working with the Logo network in executive producing a reality television show about the music business.[50][51] It was reported that the show will focus on the creation and development of an all-gay boy band.[52] To date no such project has been developed or aired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, Bass co-produced The Grand,[53] and Bass's company is reported to be developing a music docudrama about the life of rock bands on tour.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2011, Bass debuted his own boy band called Heart2Heart.[55] In August 2013, Bass became an executive producer of the documentary film Kidnapped for Christ along with Mike C. Manning. The film sheds light on controversial behavior modification methods used on children, sent there by their parents, at an Evangelical Christian reform school in the Dominican Republic.[56] The film was sold to Showtime, to be released on television July 10, 2014.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass hosted Dirty Pop with Lance Bass, a daily evening drive time radio show focusing on pop culture and entertainment news on OutQ, a LGBT-geared station on Sirius XM.[58] Bass was also the host of the weekly \\"Pop2Kountdown\\" on Pop2K, which counts down the 30 biggest hits from that week from a different year in the 2000s.\\r\\n\\r\\nBass dated actress Danielle Fishel of TV's Boy Meets World throughout 1999 and 2000.[59] Fishel stated that she was heavily invested in the relationship, commenting that she was \\"so in love\\" with Bass.[60] Bass ended the relationship after one year,[14] and continued to exclusively date women until he was 22.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his autobiography, Bass documents two gay relationships that predated media speculation; one with a Miami, Florida, native named Jesse, with whom Bass lived for two years, and another with an Idaho native named Joe.[62] Bass began dating Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl in early 2006, a courtship that garnered tabloid coverage and led to Bass's decision to come out.[9] Bass described his relationship with Lehmkuhl as \\"very stable\\";[9] however, the couple split several months later.[63] Shortly after his split with Lehmkuhl, Bass briefly dated Brazilian model and LXTV host Pedro Andrade.[64] From August 2007 to March 2008, Bass dated New York-based hairdresser Ben Thigpen.[65][66][67] After a year and a half of dating, Bass became engaged to Michael Turchin in September 2013.[68] Bass and Turchin married on December 20, 2014 in Los Angeles.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2006 interview, Bass stated that he has Attention-Deficit Disorder.[70] Bass's favorite music bands are Aerosmith, the Goo Goo Dolls, and Journey,[51] and his favorite actress is Lucille Ball, whom he grew up watching on I Love Lucy re-runs.[71] He is a self-described \\"huge Dr. Seuss fan\\", devoting an entire room in his Jackson, Mississippi estate to Seuss memorabilia.[71][72] Bass has said that he is a Christian and that he regularly attends church,[73][74][75] though he considers himself to be non-denominational.[14] He is the godfather of former bandmate Joey Fatone's daughters, Briahna and Kloey. Bass and Fatone are best friends.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass came out as gay in a cover story for People magazine on July 26, 2006.[9] There had been considerable media speculation about his orientation due to numerous paparazzi snapshots of him at gay bars and nightclubs, most notably during the preceding Independence Day weekend in Provincetown, Massachusetts.[77] Celebrity gossip blogger Perez Hilton had also been posting items on his website about Bass's orientation since September 2005,[78] and New York gossip column Page Six ran a blurb on July 12, 2006, that reported a sighting of Bass at a gay bar with his then-boyfriend, Reichen Lehmkuhl.[77] Bass's publicist, Ken Sunshine, chose to release the story exclusively to People magazine, who bumped actor Johnny Depp off of that week's cover in favor of Bass.[79] In his coming out interview, Bass stated,\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thing is, I'm not ashamed?ÿ that's the one thing I want to say. I don't think it's wrong, I'm not devastated going through this. I'm more liberated and happy than I've been my whole life. I'm just happy.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass's announcement received a large amount of media attention. The American public's reaction was generally positive, with Bass receiving \\"overwhelming support\\" from many teenagers and young adults who grew up listening to 'N Sync.[80] However, Bass received criticism from the LGBT community when he referred to himself and his friends as \\"straight-acting\\" in his People interview, stating, \\"I call them the SAGs?ÿ the straight-acting gays. We're just normal, typical guys. I love to watch football and drink beer.\\"[61] This comment angered some members of the LGBT community, who believed that Bass not only implied that effeminate gay men were not 'normal', but further enforced unneeded stereotypes.[80][81] In a 2007 interview with The Advocate, Bass called his comment a \\"mistake\\" and noted that he was unaware of the negative implications surrounding the term.[79] Bass stated, \\"Every community is hard to please. Our community is very fickle. It's a touchy community because it's the last civil rights movement we have left here in America. So when someone new like myself comes along and says off-the-mark things, yeah, I can see how people would get pissed.\\"[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass found himself in the midst of further controversy later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7, 2006.[10] The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets.[82] The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, \\"Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe some people think HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today.\\"[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass began dating painter and actor Michael Turchin in January 2011 and they became engaged in September 2013. They married on December 20, 2014 at the Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles. Former NSYNC bandmates Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez were in attendance; Justin Timberlake, who was then headlining his The 20/20 Experience World Tour, was not present.[84] The ceremonial event was filmed and televised in a special E! presentation: Lance Loves Michael: The Lance Bass Wedding that aired on February 5, 2015.[85] Bass and Turchin were the first same-sex couple to exchange vows on cable television.[86] After four years of marriage, the couple decided to extend their family and have a child with the help of a surrogate.[87][88]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2002, Lena Banks, a space advocate and founder/producer of Think Tank Ink Productions, contacted Lance Bass to propose his involvement in her Youngest Person in Space project. Banks brought her longtime associate David Krieff of Destiny Productions on board and through a series of events in August 2002, Bass entered cosmonaut training in Star City, Russia.[16] Bass was considered as the US host of a space competition show to be entitled The Big Mission, which had been successful in Denmark, in which several contestants would go through rigorous training in order to win a seat on a Russian Soyuz space capsule. However, the game show concept was reconsidered, as the producers of the show decided it would be a much better idea to shoot a documentary of a celebrity actually training and going into space, and airing it on a major network. Lena Banks came up with the idea of the Youngest Person in Space many years before Dennis Tito had his historical flight. Through a series of events in early 2002 the chance of using Bass was presented when a colleague mentioned her space project to a friend and the friend's daughter shouted out, \\"Lance Bass wants to go into space!\\" The girl, who was an NSYNC fan, learned of Bass' lifelong dream of space travel when she read it online via a MTV forum.[16] Lena Banks spoke to Lance Bass's management who then went to him with the proposal.  \\"At first he thought we were joking,\\" Lena Banks remarks. \\"I assured him it was for real; he accepted and we moved forward with the project.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to be admitted into training, Bass had to go through strenuous physicals that saved his life. It was discovered he had cardiac arrhythmia, and he agreed to undergo heart surgery to correct it. Prior to this, in 1999, he collapsed after a concert because of his condition.[89] After several months of training, Bass received cosmonaut certification and went on to Houston's Johnson Space Center (JSC) to take part in astronaut training.  He was scheduled to fly into space on the Soyuz TMA-1 mission that was to be launched on October 30, 2002. The capsule was scheduled to fly to the International Space Station and land in a desert in Kazakhstan.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral months before Bass was scheduled to fly, the original deal to air the documentary about Bass fell through. Bass's camp turned to MTV, who initially agreed to sponsor the trip but then backed out over \\"payment, insurance, and indemnification issues.\\"[16] Shortly after, all of Bass's other sponsorships fell through, including one sponsor that pulled out because they worried about the image of their brand possibly being tarnished if Bass were to die on the mission.[16] Bass was eventually rejected from the program, and was replaced on the flight by Russian cosmonauts Yury Lonchakov, Sergei Zalyotin and Belgium's Frank De Winne.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003, Bass began serving as World Space Week's Youth Spokesman.[16] Bass has stated that he believes young people becoming more interested in space exploration \\"will help the future of our planet\\".[90] From 2003 to 2005, Bass spent World Space Week traveling to American high schools speaking with students about space exploration and encouraging them to explore careers in the fields of science and mathematics.[19] Bass is a member of the National Space Society, a non-profit educational space advocacy organization founded by Dr. Wernher von Braun.[19] Bass has served on the National Space Society's Board of governors since October 2004, alongside other space advocates such as actor Tom Hanks and author and futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke.[19] In a 2007 interview with GQ magazine, Bass stated that he \\"absolutely\\" still intends on going to space, and that he hopes to work on a space documentary.[64] Bass has also retained fluency in Russian, which he was required to learn during his training.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing public response surrounding his coming out, Bass announced that he was releasing an autobiography. The book, entitled Out of Sync, was published on October 23, 2007.[91] It was co-written by The New York Times best-selling biographer Marc Eliot, who also wrote the book's introduction, and was published by Simon Spotlight Entertainment, a division of Simon & Schuster.[51][92] The 208-page book covers what Bass describes as \\"the first chapter\\" in his life, from his childhood growing up in rural Mississippi, to his efforts to obtain a seat on a Russian space capsule and the proceeding financial issues he had with his sponsors, and culminating with Bass's decision to go public with his sexuality.[91] The book includes details about boyfriends that he kept from family and friends, and recounts NSYNC's 2002 decision to go on an \\"extended hiatus\\". Bass stated that Justin Timberlake was the sole reason NSYNC did not get back together.[51][92] Out of Sync debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list for the week of November 11, 2007.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass has been involved with a number of charities during his career. In 2001, Bass founded The Lance Bass Foundation, a non-profit organization that was designed to meet the health needs of low-income children.[5] In 2003, Bass donated $30,000 US to establish the Amber Pulliam Special Education Endowment at The University of Southern Mississippi.[93] The endowment is in honor of his younger cousin, Amber Pulliam, who has Down syndrome, and was established to financially aid students from Mississippi's Pine Belt who plan a career in special education.[93]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter 2005's Hurricane Katrina, Bass launched \\"uBid For Hurricane Relief\\", a celebrity auction to benefit victims of the hurricane, with uBid.com.[94] Proceeds from the auction were split between the Child Welfare League of America, The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation, and Ashton Kutcher's RockWorks Foundation.[94] Many of Bass's family members in Mississippi were directly affected by the hurricane.[95] That same year, Bass appeared on an episode of Extreme Makeover: Home Edition with a donation to a Russian woman to save a camp for disabled children in Russia.[96]\\r\\n\\r\\nBass is a member of the Environmental Media Association's board of directors.[97] He has also been involved with Animal Avengers, Shannon Elizabeth's animal rescue organization.[98] He has two dogs which he adopted from a rescue shelter, both of whom he posed with in a PETA ad urging people to adopt rather than buy animals.[99] In August 2007, Bass wrote a guest commentary for LOGO's \\"Visible Vote '08\\" blog, in which he expressed support for gay marriage.[100] In September 2007, Bass participated in a series of GLAAD television advertisements promoting tolerance for the LGBT community.[101] Bass has also been involved in fundraising for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\n?This article incorporates?public domain material from websites or documents of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial\\r\\n\\r\\nBiographical or discographical","input":"What does lance bass do for a living?"},{"output":"the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse","context":"Swan Lake (1876)\\r\\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\\r\\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\\r\\nList of all compositions\\r\\n\\r\\nSwan Lake (Russian: ɿҷ Ѿ Lebedinoye ozero), Op. 20, is a ballet composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1875ÿ76.  Despite its initial failure, it is now one of the most popular of all ballets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scenario, initially in two acts, was fashioned from Russian and/or German folk tales[a] and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse. The choreographer of the original production was Julius Reisinger (Vclav Reisinger). The ballet was premiered by the Bolshoi Ballet on 4 March?[O.S. 20 February]?1877[1][2] at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Although it is presented in many different versions, most ballet companies base their stagings both choreographically and musically on the 1895 revival of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, first staged for the Imperial Ballet on 15 January 1895, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. For this revival, Tchaikovsky's score was revised by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's chief conductor and composer Riccardo Drigo.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no evidence to prove who wrote the original libretto, or where the idea for the plot came from.  Russian and German folk tales have been proposed as possible sources, including \\"The White Duck\\" and \\"The Stolen Veil\\" by Johann Karl August Mus?us, but both those tales differ significantly from the ballet.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne theory is that the original choreographer, Julius Reisinger, who was a Bohemian (and therefore likely to be familiar with The Stolen Veil), created the story.  Another theory is that it was written by Vladimir Petrovich Begichev, director of the Moscow Imperial Theatres at the time, possibly with Vasily Geltser, Danseur of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre (a surviving copy of the libretto bears his name). Since the first published libretto does not correspond with Tchaikovsky's music in many places, one theory is that the first published version was written by a journalist after viewing initial rehearsals (new opera and ballet productions were always reported in the newspapers, along with their respective scenarios).\\r\\n\\r\\nSome contemporaries of Tchaikovsky recalled the composer taking great interest in the life story of Bavarian King Ludwig II, whose tragic life had supposedly been marked by the sign of Swan and could have been the prototype of the dreamer Prince Siegfried.[5]  However, Ludwig's tragic death happened 10 years after the first performance of the ballet. \\r\\n\\r\\nBegichev commissioned the score of Swan Lake from Tchaikovsky in May 1875 for 800 rubles. Tchaikovsky worked with only a basic outline from Julius Reisinger of the requirements for each dance.[6] However, unlike the instructions for the scores of The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, no written instruction is known to have survived.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom around the time of the turn of the 19th century until the beginning of the 1890s, scores for ballets were almost always written by composers known as \\"specialists,\\" who were highly skilled at scoring the light, decorative, melodious, and rhythmically clear music that was at that time in vogue for ballet. Tchaikovsky studied the music of \\"specialists\\" such as the Italian Cesare Pugni and the Austrian Ludwig Minkus, before setting to work on Swan Lake. \\r\\n\\r\\nTchaikovsky had a rather negative opinion of the \\"specialist\\" ballet music until he studied it in detail, being impressed by the nearly limitless variety of infectious melodies their scores contained. Tchaikovsky most admired the ballet music of such composers as Lo Delibes, Adolphe Adam, and later, Riccardo Drigo. He would later write to his protg, the composer Sergei Taneyev, \\"I listened to the Delibes ballet 'Sylvia'...what charm, what elegance, what wealth of melody, rhythm, and harmony. I was ashamed, for if I had known of this music then, I would not have written 'Swan Lake.'\\" Tchaikovsky most admired Adam's 1844 score for Giselle, which used the Leitmotif technique: associating certain themes with certain characters or moods, a technique he would use in Swan Lake, and later, The Sleeping Beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\nTchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his Swan Lake score.  According to two of Tchaikovsky's relatives  his nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck-Davydova  the composer had earlier created a little ballet called The Lake of the Swans at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous Leitmotif, the Swan's Theme or Song of the Swans. He also made use of material from The Voyevoda, an opera he had abandoned in 1868. The Grand adage (a.k.a. the Love Duet) from the second scene of Swan Lake was fashioned from an aria from that opera, as was the Valse des fiances from the third scene. Another number which included a theme from The Voyevoda was the Entr'acte of the fourth scene. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy April 1876 the score was complete, and rehearsals began. Soon Reisinger began setting certain numbers aside that he dubbed \\"undanceable.\\" Reisinger even began choreographing dances to other composers' music, but Tchaikovsky protested and his pieces were reinstated.  Although the two artists were required to collaborate, each seemed to prefer working as independently of the other as possible.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nTchaikovsky's excitement with Swan Lake is evident from the speed with which he composed: commissioned in the spring of 1875, the piece was created within one full year. His letters to Sergei Taneyev from August 1875 indicate, however, that it was not only his excitement that compelled him to create it so quickly but his wish to finish it as soon as possible, so as to allow him to start on an opera. Respectively, he created scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then the orchestration in the fall and winter, and was still struggling with the instrumentation in the spring. By April 1876, the work was complete. Tchaikovsky's mention of a draft suggests the presence of some sort of abstract but no such draft has ever been seen. Tchaikovsky wrote various letters to friends expressing his longstanding desire to work with this type of music, and his excitement concerning his current stimulating, albeit laborious task.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nMoscow premire (world premire)\\r\\n\\r\\nSt. Petersburg premire\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable productions\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginal interpreters\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premire on Friday, 4 March 1877, was given as a benefit performance for the ballerina Pelageya Karpakova (also known as Polina Karpakova), who performed the role of Odette, with premire danseur Victor Gillert as Prince Siegfried. Karpakova may also have danced the part Odile, although it is believed the ballet originally called for two different dancers. It is now common practice for the same ballerina to dance both Odette and Odile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya was originally cast as Odette, but was replaced when a governing official in Moscow complained about her, claiming she had accepted jewelry from him, only to then marry a fellow danseur and sell the pieces for cash. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe premire was not well-received. Though there were a few critics who recognised the virtues of the score, most considered it to be far too complicated for ballet. It was labelled, \\"too noisy, too 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic.\\"[10] The critics also thought Reisinger's choreography was \\"unimaginative and altogether unmemorable.\\"[10]  The German origins of the story were \\"treated with suspicion while the tale itself was regarded as 'stupid' with unpronounceable surnames for its characters.\\"[10] Karpakova was a secondary soloist and \\"not particularly convincing.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\"The poverty of the production, meaning the dcor and costumes, the absence of outstanding performers, the Balletmaster's weakness of imagination, and, finally, the orchestra...all of this together permitted (Tchaikovsky) with good reason to cast the blame for the failure on others.\\"\\r\\n Yet the fact remains (and is too often omitted in accounts of this initial production) that this staging survived for six years with a total of 41 performances ÿ many more than several other ballets from the repertoire of this theatre.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 26 April 1877, Anna Sobeshchanskaya made her dbut as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, and from the start she was completely dissatisfied with the ballet. Sobeshchanskaya asked Marius PetipaPremier Ma?tre de Ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres to choreograph a pas de deux to replace the pas de six in the third act (for a ballerina to request a supplemental pas or variation was standard practice in 19th century ballet, and often these \\"custom-made\\" dances were the legal property of the ballerina they were composed for).\\r\\n\\r\\nPetipa created the pas de deux to music by Ludwig Minkus, ballet composer to the St Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The piece was a standard pas de deux classique consisting of a short entre, the grand adage, a variation for each dancer individually, and a coda.\\r\\n\\r\\nTchaikovsky was angered by this change, stating that whether the ballet was good or bad, he alone should be held responsible for its music. He agreed to compose a new pas de deux, but soon a problem arose: Sobeshchanskaya wanted to retain Petipa's choreography. Tchaikovsky agreed to compose a pas that would match to such a degree, the ballerina would not even be required to rehearse. Sobeshchanskaya was so pleased with Tchaikovsky's new music, she requested he compose an additional variation, which he did.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 1953 this pas de deux was thought to be lost, until an accidentally discovered reptiteur was found in the archives of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre among the orchestral parts used for Alexander Gorsky's revival of Le Corsaire (Gorsky had included the piece in his version of Le Corsaire staged in 1912). In 1960 George Balanchine choreographed a pas de deux to this music for the Violette Verdy, and the Conrad Ludlow performed on the City Center of Music and Drama in New York City under the title Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux,[12] as it is still known and performed today.\\r\\n\\r\\nJulius Reisinger's successor as balletmaster was Joseph Peter Hansen. Hansen made considerable efforts to salvage Swan Lake and on 13 January 1880 he presented a new production of the ballet for his own benefit performance. The part of Odette/Odile was danced by Evdokia Kalmykova, a student of the Moscow Imperial Ballet School, with Alfred Bekefi as Prince Siegfried. This production was far more well-received than the original, though by no means a great success. Hansen presented another version of Swan Lake on 28 October 1882, again with Kalmykova as Odette/Odile. For this production Hansen arranged a Grand Pas for the ballroom scene which he titled La Cosmopolitana. This was taken from the European section of the Grand Pas d'action known as The Allegory of the Continents from Marius Petipa's 1875 ballet The Bandits to the music of Ludwig Minkus. Hansen's version of Swan Lake was given only four times, the final performance being on 2 January 1883, and soon the ballet was dropped from the repertory altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all, Swan Lake was given a total of forty-one performances between its premire and the final performance of 1883 ÿ a rather lengthy run for a ballet that was so poorly received upon its premiere. Hansen would go on to become Balletmaster to the Alhambra Theatre in London and on 1 December 1884 he presented a one-act ballet titled The Swans, which was inspired by the second scene of Swan Lake. The music was composed by the Alhambra Theatre's chef d'orchestre Georges Jacoby.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second scene of Swan Lake was then presented on 21 February in Prague by the Ballet of the National Theatre in a version mounted by the Balletmaster August Berger. The ballet was given during two concerts which were conducted by Tchaikovsky. The composer noted in his diary that he experienced \\"a moment of absolute happiness\\" when the ballet was performed. Berger's production followed the 1877 libretto, though the names of Prince Siegfried and Benno were changed to Jaroslav and Zdeek, with the r?le of Benno danced by a female dancer en travestie. The r?le of Prince Siegfried was danced by Berger himself with the ballerina Giulietta Paltriniera-Bergrova as Odette. Berger's production was only given eight performances and was even planned for production at the Fantasia Garden in Moscow in 1893, but it never materialised.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the late 1880s and early 1890s, Petipa and Vsevolozhsky discussed with Tchaikovsky the possibility of reviving Swan Lake. However, Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893, just when plans to revive Swan Lake were beginning to come to fruition. It remains uncertain whether Tchaikovsky was prepared to revise the music for this revival. Whatever the case, as a result of Tchaikovsky's death, Drigo was forced to revise the score himself, after receiving approval from Tchaikovsky's younger brother, Modest. There are major differences between Drigo's and Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake score. Today, it is Riccardo Drigo's revision of Tchaikovsky's score, and not Tchaikovsky's original score of 1877, that most ballet companies use.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1894, two memorial concerts planned by Vsevolozhsky were given in honor of Tchaikovsky. The production included the second Act of Swan Lake, choreographed by Lev Ivanov, Second Balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. Ivanov's choreography for the memorial concert was unanimously hailed as wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revival of Swan Lake was planned for Piera Legnani's benefit performance in the 1894ÿ1895 season.  The death of Tsar Alexander III on 1 November 1894 and the ensuing period of official mourning brought all ballet performances and rehearsals to a close for some time, and as a result all efforts could be concentrated on the pre-production of the full revival of Swan Lake. Ivanov and Petipa collaborated on the production, with Ivanov retaining his dances for the second Act while choreographing the fourth, with Petipa staging the first and third Acts.\\r\\n\\r\\nModest Tchaikovsky was called upon to make changes to the ballet's libretto, including the character of Odette changing from a fairy swan-maiden into a cursed mortal woman, the ballet's villain changing from Odette's stepmother to the magician von Rothbart, and the ballet's finale: instead of the lovers simply drowning at the hand of Odette's stepmother as in the original 1877 scenario, Odette commits suicide by drowning herself, with Prince Siegfried choosing to die as well, rather than live without her, and soon the lovers' spirits are reunited in an apotheosis.[13] Aside from the revision of the libretto the ballet was changed from four acts to threewith Act II becoming Act I-Scene 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll was ready by the beginning of 1895 and the ballet had its premire on Friday, 27 January. Pierina Legnani danced Odette/Odile, with Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried, Alexei Bulgakov as Rothbart, and Alexander Oblakov as Benno. Most of the reviews in the St. Petersburg newspapers were positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the premire of The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake did not dominate the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre in its first season. It was given only sixteen performances between the premire and the 1895ÿ1896 season, and was not performed at all in 1897. Even more surprising, the ballet was performed only four times in 1898 and 1899. The ballet belonged solely to Legnani until she left St. Petersburg for her native Italy in 1901. After her departure, the ballet was taken over by Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who was as much celebrated in the r?le as was her Italian predecessor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the performance history of Swan Lake, the 1895 edition has served as the version on which most stagings have been based. Nearly every balletmaster or choreographer who has re-staged Swan Lake has made modifications to the ballet's scenario, while still maintaining much of the traditional choreography for the dances, which is regarded as virtually sacrosanct. Likewise, over time the r?le of Siegfried has become more prominent, due largely to the evolution of ballet technique.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, San Francisco Ballet became the first American company to stage a complete production of Swan Lake. The enormously successful production starred Lew Christensen as Prince Siegfried, Jacqueline Martin as Odette, and Janet Reed as Odile. Willam Christensen based his choreography on the Petipa-Ivanov production, turning to San Francisco's large population of Russian migrs, headed by Princess and Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia, to help him ensure that the production succeeded in its goal of preserving Russian culture in San Francisco.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral notable productions have diverged from the original and its 1895 revival:\\r\\n\\r\\nSwan Lake is scored for the typical late 19th-century large orchestra:\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1895, Benno von Sommerstern had become just \\"Benno,\\" and Odette \\"Queen of the Swans.\\" Also Baron von Stein, his wife, and Freiherr von Schwarzfels and his wife were no longer identified on the program. The sovereign or ruling Princess is often rendered \\"Queen Mother.\\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe character of Rothbart (sometimes spelled Rotbart) has been open to many interpretations. The reason for his curse upon Odette is unknown; several versions, including two feature films, have suggested reasons, but none is typically explained by the ballet. He is rarely portrayed in human form, except in Act III.  He is usually shown as an owl-like creature.  In most productions, the couple's sacrifice results in his destruction.  However, there are versions in which he is triumphant.  One example is the Bolshoi Ballet's version, where he plays a wicked game of fate with Siegfried, which he wins at the end, causing Siegfried to lose everything. In the second American Ballet Theatre production of Swan Lake, he is portrayed by two dancers: a young, handsome one who lures Odette to her doom in the prologue, and a reptilian creature.  In this version, the lovers'  suicide inspires the rest of Rothbart's imprisoned swans to turn on him and overcome his spell.\\r\\n\\r\\nOdile, Rothbart's daughter usually wears jet black (though in the 1895 production, she did not), and appears only in Act III. In most modern productions, she is portrayed as Odette's exact double (though the resemblance is because of Rothbart's magic), and therefore Siegfried cannot be blamed for believing her to be Odette.  There is a suggestion that in the original production, Odette and Odile were danced by two different ballerinas. This is also the case in some avant garde productions.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwan Lake is generally presented in either four acts, four scenes (primarily outside Russia and Eastern Europe) or three acts, four scenes (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe). The biggest difference of productions all over the world is that the ending, originally tragic, is now sometimes altered to a happy ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome productions include a prologue that shows how Rothbart first turns Odette into a swan.\\r\\n\\r\\nA magnificent park before a palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Scne: Allegro giusto] Prince Siegfried is celebrating his birthday with his tutor, friends and peasants [Waltz]. The revelries are interrupted by Siegfried's mother, the Queen [Scne: Allegro moderato], who is concerned about her son's carefree lifestyle. She tells him that he must choose a bride at the royal ball the following evening (some productions include the presentation of some possible candidates). Siegfried is upset that he cannot marry for love. His friend Benno and the tutor try to lift his troubled mood. As evening falls [Sujet], Benno sees a flock of swans flying overhead and suggests they go on a hunt [Finale I]. Siegfried and his friends take their crossbows and set off in pursuit of the swans.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lakeside clearing in a forest by the ruins of a chapel. A moonlit night.\\r\\n\\r\\nSiegfried has become separated from his friends. He arrives at the lakeside clearing, just as a flock of swans land [Scne. Moderato]. He aims his crossbow [Scne. Allegro moderato-], but freezes when one of them transforms into a beautiful maiden, Odette [Scne. -Moderato]. At first, she is terrified of Siegfried. When he promises not to harm her, she explains she and her companions are victims of a spell cast by the evil owl-like sorcerer Rothbart. By day they are turned into swans and only at night, by the side of the enchanted lake ÿ created from the tears of Odette's mother ÿ do they return to human form. The spell can only be broken if one who has never loved before swears to love Odette forever. Rothbart suddenly appears [Scne. -Allegro vivo]. Siegfried threatens to kill him but Odette intercedes ÿ if Rothbart dies before the spell is broken, it can never be undone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Rothbart disappears, the swan maidens fill the clearing [Scne: Allegro, Moderato assai quasi andante]. Siegfried breaks his crossbow, and sets about winning Odette's trust as the two fall in love. But as dawn arrives, the evil spell draws Odette and her companions back to the lake and they are turned into swans again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn opulent hall in the palace.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuests arrive at the palace for a costume ball. Six princesses are presented to the prince [Entrance of the Guests and Waltz], as candidates for marriage. Rothbart arrives in disguise [Scne: Allegro, Allegro giusto] with his daughter, Odile, who is transformed to look like Odette. Though the princesses try to attract the prince with their dances [Pas de six], Siegfried has eyes only for Odile. [Scne: Allegro, Tempo di valse, Allegro vivo] Odette appears (usually at the castle window) and vainly tries to warn Siegfried, but Siegfried does not see her and proclaims to the court that he will marry Odile. Rothbart shows Siegfried a magical vision of Odette and he realises his mistake. Grief-stricken, Siegfried hurries back to the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the lakeside.\\r\\n\\r\\nOdette is distraught. The swan-maidens try to comfort her. Siegfried returns to the lake and makes a passionate apology. She forgives him, but his betrayal cannot be undone. Rather than remain a swan forever, Odette chooses to die. Siegfried chooses to die with her and they leap into the lake. This breaks Rothbart's spell over the swan maidens, causing him to lose his power over them and he dies. In an apotheosis, the swan maidens watch as Siegfried and Odette ascend into the Heavens together, forever united in love.\\r\\n\\r\\nAct 1: Prince Siegfried, his friends, and a group of peasants are celebrating the Prince's coming of age. Siegfried's mother arrives to inform him that she wishes for him to marry soon so that she may make sure that he does not disgrace their family line by his marriage. She has organised a ball where Siegfried is to choose his bride from among the daughters of the nobility. After the celebration Siegfried and his friend Benno spot a flock of flying swans and decide to hunt them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAct 2: Siegfried and Benno track the swans to a lake, but they vanish. A woman wearing a crown appears and confronts the two men. She tells them that her name is Odette and she was one of the swans they were hunting. She tells them her story: Odettes mother, a good fairy, had married a knight, but she died and the knight remarried. Odettes stepmother was a witch who wanted to kill her, but her grandfather saved her. Odette's grandfather had cried so much over the death of Odettes mother that he created the lake with his tears. Odette and her companions live in the lake with Odettes grandfather, and can transform themselves into swans whenever they wish. Odettes stepmother still wants to kill her, and stalks her in the form of an owl, but Odette has a crown which protects her from harm. When Odette gets married the witch will lose the power to harm her. Siegfried falls in love with Odette but Odette fears that the witch will ruin their happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAct 3: Several young noblewomen dance at Siegfrieds ball, but the Prince refuses to marry any of them. Baron von Rothbart and his daughter Odile arrive. Siegfried thinks that Odile looks like Odette, but Benno doesnt agree. Siegfried dances with Odile, grows more and more enamoured with her, and eventually agrees to marry her. At that moment Rothbart transforms into a demon, Odile laughs, and a white swan wearing a crown appears in the window. The Prince runs out of the castle.\\r\\n\\r\\nAct 4: In tears, Odette tells her friends that Siegfried did not keep his vow of love. Seeing that Siegfried is coming, Odettes friends leave and urge her to go with them, but Odette wants to see Siegfried one last time. A storm begins. Siegfried enters and begs Odette for forgiveness. Odette refuses and attempts to leave. Siegfried snatches the crown from her head and throws it in the lake, saying \\"Willing or unwilling, you will always remain with me!\\" The owl flies overhead, carrying away the crown. \\"What have you done? I am dying!\\" Odette says, and falls into Siegfrieds arms. The lake rises from the storm and drowns Odette and Siegfried. The storm quiets, and a group of swans appears on the lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany different endings exist, ranging from romantic to tragic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe score used in this rsum is Tchaikovsky's score as he originally composed it (including later additions of the original 1877 production).[25] The score as listed here is different from the score as revised by Riccardo Drigo for the revival of Petipa and Ivanov that is still used to one extent or another by most ballet companies today.

It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). It is occasionally known as the Department of Defense (DoD) model because the development of the networking method was funded by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA.\\r\\nThe Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved.[1][2] From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.\\r\\nTechnical standards specifying the Internet protocol suite and many of its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet protocol suite predates the OSI model, a more comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Internet protocol suite resulted from research and development conducted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s.[3] After initiating the pioneering ARPANET in 1969, DARPA started work on a number of other data transmission technologies. In 1972, Robert E. Kahn joined the DARPA Information Processing Technology Office, where he worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. In the spring of 1973, Vinton Cerf, the developer of the existing ARPANET Network Control Program (NCP) protocol, joined Kahn to work on open-architecture interconnection models with the goal of designing the next protocol generation for the ARPANET.\\r\\nBy the summer of 1973, Kahn and Cerf had worked out a fundamental reformulation, in which the differences between local network protocols were hidden by using a common internetwork protocol, and, instead of the network being responsible for reliability, as in the ARPANET, this function was delegated to the hosts. Cerf credits Hubert Zimmermann and Louis Pouzin, designer of the CYCLADES network, with important influences on this design. The protocol was implemented as the Transmission Control Program, first published in 1974.[4]\\r\\nInitially, the TCP managed both datagram transmissions and routing, but as the protocol grew, other researchers recommended a division of functionality into protocol layers. Advocates included Jonathan Postel of the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute, who edited the Request for Comments (RFCs), the technical and strategic document series that has both documented and catalyzed Internet development.[5] Postel stated, \\"We are screwing up in our design of Internet protocols by violating the principle of layering.\\"[6] Encapsulation of different mechanisms was intended to create an environment where the upper layers could access only what was needed from the lower layers. A monolithic design would be inflexible and lead to scalability issues. The Transmission Control Program was split into two distinct protocols, the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.\\r\\nThe design of the network included the recognition that it should provide only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic between end nodes and that all other intelligence should be located at the edge of the network, in the end nodes. This design is known as the end-to-end principle. Using this design, it became possible to connect almost any network to the ARPANET, irrespective of the local characteristics, thereby solving Kahn's initial internetworking problem. One popular expression is that TCP/IP, the eventual product of Cerf and Kahn's work, can run over \\"two tin cans and a string.\\"[citation needed] Years later, as a joke, the IP over Avian Carriers formal protocol specification was created and successfully tested.\\r\\nA computer called a router is provided with an interface to each network. It forwards network packets back and forth between them.[7] Originally a router was called gateway, but the term was changed to avoid confusion with other types of gateways.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom 1973 to 1974, Cerf's networking research group at Stanford worked out details of the idea, resulting in the first TCP specification.[8] A significant technical influence was the early networking work at Xerox PARC, which produced the PARC Universal Packet protocol suite, much of which existed around that time.\\r\\nDARPA then contracted with BBN Technologies, Stanford University, and the University College London to develop operational versions of the protocol on different hardware platforms. Four versions were developed: TCP v1, TCP v2, TCP v3 and IP v3, and TCP/IP v4. The last protocol is still in use today. In 1975, a two-network TCP/IP communications test was performed between Stanford and University College London (UCL). In November, 1977, a three-network TCP/IP test was conducted between sites in the US, the UK, and Norway. Several other TCP/IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983. The migration of the ARPANET to TCP/IP was officially completed on flag day January 1, 1983, when the new protocols were permanently activated.[9]\\r\\nIn March 1982, the US Department of Defense declared TCP/IP as the standard for all military computer networking.[10]\\r\\nIn 1985, the Internet Advisory Board (later renamed the Internet Architecture Board) held a three-day workshop on TCP/IP for the computer industry, attended by 250 vendor representatives, promoting the protocol and leading to its increasing commercial use. In 1985, the first Interop conference focused on network interoperability by broader adoption of TCP/IP. The conference was founded by Dan Lynch, an early Internet activist. From the beginning, large corporations, such as IBM and DEC, attended the meeting.[11]\\r\\nIBM, AT&T and DEC were the first major corporations to adopt TCP/IP, this despite having competing proprietary protocols (SNA, XNS, DECNET). In IBM, from 1984, Barry Appelman's group did TCP/IP development. They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. At the same time, several smaller companies, such as FTP Software and the Wollongong Group, began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and MS Windows.[12] The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.[13]\\r\\nSome of these TCP/IP stacks were written single-handedly by a few programmers. Jay Elinsky and Oleg Vishnepolsky of IBM Research wrote TCP/IP stacks for VM/CMS and OS/2, respectively.[14] In 1984 Donald Gillies at MIT wrote a 'ntcp' multi-connection TCP which ran atop the IP/PacketDriver layer maintained by John Romkey at MIT in 1983-4. Romkey leveraged this TCP in 1986 when FTP Software was founded.[15][16] Phil Karn created KA9Q TCP (a multi-connection TCP for ham radio applications) starting in 1985.[17]\\r\\nThe spread of TCP/IP was fueled further in June 1989, when AT&T agreed to place the TCP/IP code developed for UNIX into the public domain. Various vendors, including IBM, included this code in their own TCP/IP stacks. Many companies sold TCP/IP stacks for Windows until Microsoft released a native TCP/IP stack in Windows 95. This event was a little late in the evolution of the Internet, but it cemented TCP/IP's dominance over other protocols, which began to lose ground. These protocols included IBM Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), and Xerox Network Systems (XNS).\\r\\nAn early architectural document, RFC 1122, emphasizes architectural principles over layering.[18]\\r\\nThe end-to-end principle has evolved over time. Its original expression put the maintenance of state and overall intelligence at the edges, and assumed the Internet that connected the edges retained no state and concentrated on speed and simplicity. Real-world needs for firewalls, network address translators, web content caches and the like have forced changes in this principle.[19]\\r\\nThe robustness principle states: \\"In general, an implementation must be conservative in its sending behavior, and liberal in its receiving behavior. That is, it must be careful to send well-formed datagrams, but must accept any datagram that it can interpret (e.g., not object to technical errors where the meaning is still clear).\\"[20] \\"The second part of the principle is almost as important: software on other hosts may contain deficiencies that make it unwise to exploit legal but obscure protocol features.\\"[21] Postel famously summarized the principle as, \\"Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others\\"a saying that came to be known as \\"Postel's Law.\\"\\r\\nEncapsulation is used to provide abstraction of protocols and services. Encapsulation is usually aligned with the division of the protocol suite into layers of general functionality. In general, an application (the highest level of the model) uses a set of protocols to send its data down the layers, being further encapsulated at each level.\\r\\nThe layers of the protocol suite near the top are logically closer to the user application, while those near the bottom are logically closer to the physical transmission of the data. Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate upper layer protocols from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to know the details of each and every application and its protocol.\\r\\nEven when the layers are examined, the assorted architectural documentsthere is no single architectural model such as ISO 7498, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) modelhave fewer and less rigidly defined layers than the OSI model, and thus provide an easier fit for real-world protocols. One frequently referenced document, RFC 1958, does not contain a stack of layers. The lack of emphasis on layering is a major difference between the IETF and OSI approaches. It only refers to the existence of the internetworking layer and generally to upper layers; this document was intended as a 1996 snapshot of the architecture: \\"The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution is one of the main reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture.\\"\\r\\nRFC 1122, entitled Host Requirements, is structured in paragraphs referring to layers, but the document refers to many other architectural principles not emphasizing layering. It loosely defines a four-layer model, with the layers having names, not numbers, as follows:\\r\\nThe Internet protocol suite and the layered protocol stack design were in use before the OSI model was established. Since then, the TCP/IP model has been compared with the OSI model in books and classrooms, which often results in confusion because the two models use different assumptions and goals, including the relative importance of strict layering.\\r\\nThis abstraction also allows upper layers to provide services that the lower layers do not provide. While the original OSI model was extended to include connectionless services (OSIRM CL),[22] IP is not designed to be reliable and is a best effort delivery protocol. This means that all transport layer implementations must choose whether or how to provide reliability. UDP provides data integrity via a checksum but does not guarantee delivery; TCP provides both data integrity and delivery guarantee by retransmitting until the receiver acknowledges the reception of the packet.\\r\\nThis model lacks the formalism of the OSI model and associated documents, but the IETF does not use a formal model and does not consider this a limitation, as illustrated in the comment by David D. Clark, \\"We reject: kings, presidents and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code.\\" Criticisms of this model, which have been made with respect to the OSI model, often do not consider ISO's later extensions to that model.\\r\\nFor multi-access links with their own addressing systems (e.g. Ethernet) an address mapping protocol is needed. Such protocols can be considered to be below IP but above the existing link system. While the IETF does not use the terminology, this is a subnetwork dependent convergence facility according to an extension to the OSI model, the internal organization of the network layer (IONL).[23]\\r\\nICMP & IGMP operate on top of IP but do not transport data like UDP or TCP. Again, this functionality exists as layer management extensions to the OSI model, in its Management Framework (OSIRM MF)[24]\\r\\nThe SSL/TLS library operates above the transport layer (uses TCP) but below application protocols. Again, there was no intention, on the part of the designers of these protocols, to comply with OSI architecture.\\r\\nThe link is treated as a black box. The IETF explicitly does not intend to discuss transmission systems, which is a less academic[25][citation needed] but practical alternative to the OSI model.\\r\\nThe following is a description of each layer in the TCP/IP networking model starting from the lowest level.\\r\\nThe link layer has the networking scope of the local network connection to which a host is attached. This regime is called the link in TCP/IP literature. It is the lowest component layer of the Internet protocols, as TCP/IP is designed to be hardware independent. As a result, TCP/IP may be implemented on top of virtually any hardware networking technology.\\r\\nThe link layer is used to move packets between the Internet layer interfaces of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, as well as on firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a physical medium. The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.\\r\\nThis is also the layer where packets may be selected to be sent over a virtual private network or other networking tunnel. In this scenario, the link layer data may be considered application data which traverses another instantiation of the IP stack for transmission or reception over another IP connection. Such a connection, or virtual link, may be established with a transport protocol or even an application scope protocol that serves as a tunnel in the link layer of the protocol stack. Thus, the TCP/IP model does not dictate a strict hierarchical encapsulation sequence.\\r\\nThe TCP/IP model's link layer corresponds to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model physical and data link layers, layers one and two of the OSI model.\\r\\nThe internet layer has the responsibility of sending packets across potentially multiple networks. Internetworking requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called routing.\\r\\nThe Internet Protocol performs two basic functions:\\r\\nThe internet layer is not only agnostic of data structures at the transport layer, but it also does not distinguish between operation of the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data for a variety of different upper layer protocols. These protocols are each identified by a unique protocol number: for example, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.\\r\\nSome of the protocols carried by IP, such as ICMP which is used to transmit diagnostic information, and IGMP which is used to manage IP Multicast data, are layered on top of IP but perform internetworking functions. This illustrates the differences in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it is referred to as the network layer.\\r\\nThe internet layer provides an unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible internetworking, the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol is the principal component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.\\r\\nThe transport layer establishes basic data channels that applications use for task-specific data exchange. The layer establishes process-to-process connectivity, meaning it provides end-to-end services that are independent of the structure of user data and the logistics of exchanging information for any particular specific purpose. Its responsibility includes end-to-end message transfer independent of the underlying network, along with error control, segmentation, flow control, congestion control, and application addressing (port numbers). End-to-end message transmission or connecting applications at the transport layer can be categorized as either connection-oriented, implemented in TCP, or connectionless, implemented in UDP.\\r\\nFor the purpose of providing process-specific transmission channels for applications, the layer establishes the concept of the port. This is a numbered logical construct allocated specifically for each of the communication channels an application needs. For many types of services, these port numbers have been standardized so that client computers may address specific services of a server computer without the involvement of service announcements or directory services.\\r\\nBecause IP provides only a best effort delivery, some transport layer protocols offer reliability. However, IP can run over a reliable data link protocol such as the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC).\\r\\nFor example, the TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that addresses numerous reliability issues in providing a reliable byte stream:\\r\\nThe newer Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is also a reliable, connection-oriented transport mechanism. It is message-stream-orientednot byte-stream-oriented like TCPand provides multiple streams multiplexed over a single connection. It also provides multi-homing support, in which a connection end can be represented by multiple IP addresses (representing multiple physical interfaces), such that if one fails, the connection is not interrupted. It was developed initially for telephony applications (to transport SS7 over IP), but can also be used for other applications.\\r\\nThe User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless datagram protocol. Like IP, it is a best effort, \\"unreliable\\" protocol. Reliability is addressed through error detection using a weak checksum algorithm. UDP is typically used for applications such as streaming media (audio, video, Voice over IP etc.) where on-time arrival is more important than reliability, or for simple query/response applications like DNS lookups, where the overhead of setting up a reliable connection is disproportionately large. Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a datagram protocol that is designed for real-time data such as streaming audio and video.\\r\\nThe applications at any given network address are distinguished by their TCP or UDP port. By convention certain well known ports are associated with specific applications.\\r\\nThe TCP/IP model's transport or host-to-host layer corresponds to the fourth layer in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, also called the transport layer.\\r\\nThe application layer includes the protocols used by most applications for providing user services or exchanging application data over the network connections established by the lower level protocols. This may include some basic network support services such as protocols for routing and host configuration. Examples of application layer protocols include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).[26] Data coded according to application layer protocols are encapsulated into transport layer protocol units (such as TCP or UDP messages), which in turn use lower layer protocols to effect actual data transfer.\\r\\nThe TCP/IP model does not consider the specifics of formatting and presenting data, and does not define additional layers between the application and transport layers as in the OSI model (presentation and session layers). Such functions are the realm of libraries and application programming interfaces.\\r\\nApplication layer protocols generally treat the transport layer (and lower) protocols as black boxes which provide a stable network connection across which to communicate, although the applications are usually aware of key qualities of the transport layer connection such as the end point IP addresses and port numbers. Application layer protocols are often associated with particular client-server applications, and common services have well-known port numbers reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, the HyperText Transfer Protocol uses server port 80 and Telnet uses server port 23. Clients connecting to a service usually use ephemeral ports, i.e., port numbers assigned only for the duration of the transaction at random or from a specific range configured in the application.\\r\\nThe transport layer and lower-level layers are unconcerned with the specifics of application layer protocols. Routers and switches do not typically examine the encapsulated traffic, rather they just provide a conduit for it. However, some firewall and bandwidth throttling applications must interpret application data. An example is the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP). It is also sometimes necessary for network address translator (NAT) traversal to consider the application payload.\\r\\nThe application layer in the TCP/IP model is often compared as equivalent to a combination of the fifth (Session), sixth (Presentation), and the seventh (Application) layers of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.\\r\\nFurthermore, the TCP/IP reference model distinguishes between user protocols and support protocols.[27] Support protocols provide services to a system. User protocols are used for actual user applications. For example, FTP is a user protocol and DNS is a support protocol.\\r\\nThe following table shows various networking models. The number of layers varies between three and seven.\\r\\nSome of the networking models are from textbooks, which are secondary sources that may conflict with the intent of RFC 1122 and other IETF primary sources.[35]\\r\\nThe three top layers in the OSI model, i.e. the application layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, there is no requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the best-effort UDP transport.\\r\\nDifferent authors have interpreted the TCP/IP model differently, and disagree whether the link layer, or the entire TCP/IP model, covers OSI layer 1 (physical layer) issues, or whether a hardware layer is assumed below the link layer.\\r\\nSeveral authors have attempted to incorporate the OSI model's layers 1 and 2 into the TCP/IP model, since these are commonly referred to in modern standards (for example, by IEEE and ITU). This often results in a model with five layers, where the link layer or network access layer is split into the OSI model's layers 1 and 2.\\r\\nThe IETF protocol development effort is not concerned with strict layering. Some of its protocols may not fit cleanly into the OSI model, although RFCs sometimes refer to it and often use the old OSI layer numbers. The IETF has repeatedly stated[citation needed] that Internet protocol and architecture development is not intended to be OSI-compliant. RFC 3439, addressing Internet architecture, contains a section entitled: \\"Layering Considered Harmful\\".[35]\\r\\nFor example, the session and presentation layers of the OSI suite are considered to be included to the application layer of the TCP/IP suite. The functionality of the session layer can be found in protocols like HTTP and SMTP and is more evident in protocols like Telnet and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Session layer functionality is also realized with the port numbering of the TCP and UDP protocols, which cover the transport layer in the TCP/IP suite. Functions of the presentation layer are realized in the TCP/IP applications with the MIME standard in data exchange.\\r\\nConflicts are apparent also in the original OSI model, ISO 7498, when not considering the annexes to this model, e.g., the ISO 7498/4 Management Framework, or the ISO 8648 Internal Organization of the Network layer (IONL). When the IONL and Management Framework documents are considered, the ICMP and IGMP are defined as layer management protocols for the network layer. In like manner, the IONL provides a structure for \\"subnetwork dependent convergence facilities\\" such as ARP and RARP.\\r\\nIETF protocols can be encapsulated recursively, as demonstrated by tunneling protocols such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). GRE uses the same mechanism that OSI uses for tunneling at the network layer.\\r\\nThe Internet protocol suite does not presume any specific hardware or software environment. It only requires that hardware and a software layer exists that is capable of sending and receiving packets on a computer network. As a result, the suite has been implemented on essentially every computing platform. A minimal implementation of TCP/IP includes the following: Internet Protocol (IP), Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). In addition to IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, Internet Protocol version 6 requires Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), ICMPv6, and IGMPv6 and is often accompanied by an integrated IPSec security layer.\\r\\nApplication programmers are typically concerned only with interfaces in the application layer and often also in the transport layer, while the layers below are services provided by the TCP/IP stack in the operating system. Most IP implementations are accessible to programmers through sockets and APIs.\\r\\nUnique implementations include Lightweight TCP/IP, an open source stack designed for embedded systems, and KA9Q NOS, a stack and associated protocols for amateur packet radio systems and personal computers connected via serial lines.\\r\\nMicrocontroller firmware in the network adapter typically handles link issues, supported by driver software in the operating system. Non-programmable analog and digital electronics are normally in charge of the physical components below the link layer, typically using an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chipset for each network interface or other physical standard. High-performance routers are to a large extent based on fast non-programmable digital electronics, carrying out link level switching.","input":"Which came first tcp/ip or osi?"},{"output":"mile Durkheim","context":"In sociology and criminology, strain theory states that social structures within society may pressure citizens to commit crime. Following on the work of mile Durkheim, strain theories have been advanced by Robert King Merton (1938), Albert K. Cohen (1955), Richard Cloward, Lloyd Ohlin (1960), Neil Smelser (1963), Robert Agnew (1992), Steven Messner and Richard Rosenfeld (1994).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStrain theory is a sociology and criminology theory developed in 1938 by Robert K. Merton.[1] The theory states that society puts pressure on individuals to achieve socially accepted goals (such as the American dream) though they lack the means, this leads to strain which may lead the individuals to commit crimes. Examples being selling drugs or becoming involved in prostitution to gain financial security.[1]\\r\\nStrain may either be:\\r\\nRobert King Merton was an American sociologist who argued that society can encourage deviance to a large degree. Merton believed that socially accepted goals put pressure on people to conform. People are forced to work within the system or become members of a deviant subculture to achieve the desired goal. Merton's belief became the theory known as Strain Theory. Merton continued on to say when individuals are faced with a gap between their goals (usually finances/money related) and their current status, strain occurs. When faced with strain, people have five ways to adapt:[1]\\r\\nGeneral strain theory (GST) is a sociology and criminology theory developed in 1992 by Robert Agnew. Agnew believed that Merton's theory was too vague in nature and did not account for criminal activity which did not involve financial gain. The core idea of general strain theory is that people who experience strain or stress become distressed or upset which may lead them to commit crime in order to cope. One of the key principle of this theory is emotion as the motivator for crime. The theory was developed to conceptualize the full range of sources in society where strain possibly comes from, which Merton's strain theory does not. The theory also focuses on the perspective of goals for status, expectations and class rather than focusing on money (as Merton's theory does). Examples of General Strain Theory are people who use illegal drugs to make themselves feel better, or a student assaulting his peers to end the harassment they caused.[2][3][4]\\r\\nGST introduces 3 main sources of strain such as:[5]\\r\\nInstitutional anomie theory (IAT) is a criminology theory developed in 1994 in by Steven Messner and Richard Rosenfeld. The theory proposes that an institutional arrangement with a market, where the market/economy is allowed to operate/dominate without restraints from other social intuitions like family will likely cause criminal behavior. Derived from Merton's Strain Theory, IAT expands on the macro levels of the theory. IAT's focus centers on the criminal influences of varied social institutions, rather than just the economic structure.[6][7]\\r\\nIllegitimate opportunities is a sociology theory developed in 1960 by Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlin. The theory states that crimes result from a high number of illegitimate opportunities and not from a lack of legitimate ones. The theory was created from Merton's strain theory to help address juvenile delinquency.[8]\\r\\nIn 1992, Robert Agnew asserted that strain theory could be central in explaining crime and deviance, but that it needed revision so that it was not tied to social class or cultural variables, but re-focused on norms. To this end, Agnew proposed a general strain theory that is neither structural nor interpersonal but rather individual and emotional, paying special attention to an individual's immediate social environment. He argued that an individual's actual or anticipated failure to achieve positively valued goals, actual or anticipated removal of positively valued stimuli, and actual or anticipated presentation of negative stimuli all result in strain.\\r\\nAnger and frustration confirm negative relationships. The resulting behavior patterns will often be characterized by more than their share of unilateral action because an individual will have a natural desire to avoid unpleasant rejections, and these unilateral actions (especially when antisocial) will further contribute to an individual's alienation from society. If particular rejections are generalized into feelings that the environment is unsupportive,more strongly negative emotions may motivate the individual to engage in crime. This is most likely to be true for younger individuals, and Agnew suggested that research focus on the magnitude, recency, duration, and clustering of such strain-related events to determine whether a person copes with strain in a criminal or conforming manner. Temperament, intelligence, interpersonal skills, self-efficacy, the presence of conventional social support, and the absence of association with antisocial (e.g., criminally inclined) age and status peers are chief among the factors Agnew identified as beneficial.\\r\\nThe strain theory of suicide postulates that suicide is usually preceded by psychological strains. A psychological strain is formed by at least two stresses or pressures, pushing the individual to different directions. A strain can be a consequence of any of the four conflicts: differential values, discrepancy between aspiration and reality, relative deprivation, and lack of coping skills for a crisis. Psychological strains in the form of all the four sources have been tested and supported with a sample of suicide notes in the United States and in rural China through psychological autopsy studies. The strain theory of suicide forms a challenge to the psychiatric model popular among the suicidologists in the world.\\r\\nThe strain theory of suicide is based on the theoretical frameworks established by previous sociologists, e.g. Durkheim (1951), Merton (1957), and Agnew (2006), and preliminary tests have been accomplished with some American (Zhang and Lester 2008) and Chinese data (Zhang 2010; Zhang, Dong, Delprino, and Zhou 2009; Zhang, Wieczorek, Conwell, and Tu 2011).\\r\\nThere could be four types of strain that precede a suicide, and each can be derived from specific sources. A source of strain must consist of two, and at least two, conflicting social facts. If the two social facts are non-contradictory, there would be no strain.\\r\\nWhen two conflicting social values or beliefs are competing in an individuals daily life, the person experiences value strain. The two conflicting social facts are competing personal beliefs internalized in the persons value system. A cult member may experience strain if the mainstream culture and the cult religion are both considered important in the cult members daily life. Other examples include the second generation of immigrants in the United States who have to abide by the ethnic culture rules enforced in the family while simultaneously adapting to the American culture with peers and school. In China, rural young women appreciate gender egalitarianism advocated by the communist government, but at the same time, they are trapped in cultural sexual discrimination as traditionally cultivated by Confucianism. Another example that might be found in developing countries is the differential values of traditional collectivism and modern individualism. When the two conflicting values are taken as equally important in a persons daily life, the person experiences great strain. When one value is more important than the other, there is then little or no strain.\\r\\nStrain theory has received several criticisms, such as:[9][10]\\r\\nStrain theory was tested following its development. Most of these test examined ideal goals such as occupational goals and individual expectations, which would most ideally lead to crimes if not achieved under rule of strain theory. However, most of the research found that this was not the case. An example of these studies was a study done by Travis Hirschi in the 1969. He analyzes a large body of data on delinquency collected in Western Contra Costa County, California that contrast with strain theory.[11] These results and other criticisms lead to the abandonment of strain theory around the 1970s to the 80s.\\r\\nO'Grady W.

Within the provinces under the ministry of education, there are district school boards administering the educational programs.[18]\\r\\nEducation is compulsory up to the age of 16 in every province in Canada, except for Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick, where the compulsory age is 18, or as soon as a high school diploma has been achieved. In some provinces early leaving exemptions can be granted under certain circumstances at 14. Canada generally has 190 (180 in Quebec) school days in the year, officially starting from September (after Labour Day) to the end of June (usually the last Friday of the month, except in Quebec when it is just before June 24?ÿ the provincial holiday). In British Columbia secondary schools, there are 172 school days during a school year. (2013-2014).[19] In Alberta, high school students get an additional four weeks off to accommodate for exam break; two weeks in January, and two in June. Classes typically end on the 15th of those two months.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nElementary, secondary, and post-secondary education in Canada is a provincial responsibility and there are many variations between the provinces. The federal government's responsibilities in education are limited to the Royal Military College of Canada, and funding the education of indigenous peoples.\\r\\nAbout one out of ten Canadians does not have a high school diploma?ÿ one in seven has a university degree?ÿ the adult population that is without a high school diploma is a combination of both immigrant and Canadian-born. In many places, publicly funded high school courses are offered to the adult population. The ratio of high school graduates versus non diploma-holders is changing rapidly, partly due to changes in the labour market[20] that require people to have a high school diploma and, in many cases, a university degree. Nonetheless, more than 51% of Canadians have a college degree, the highest rate in the world by far.[21] The majority of schools, at 67%, are co-educational.\\r\\nCanada spends about 5.4% of its GDP on education.[12] The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than 20 000 USD per student).[22] Recent reports suggest that from 2006 the tuition fees of Canadian universities have increased by 40 percent.[23] Since the adoption of section 23 of the Constitution Act, 1982, education in both English and French has been available in most places across Canada (if the population of children speaking the minority language justifies it), although French Second Language education/French Immersion is available to anglophone students across Canada.\\r\\nAccording to an announcement of Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Canada is introducing a new, fast-track system to let foreign students and graduates with Canadian work experience become permanent eligible residents in Canada.[24]\\r\\nMost schools have introduced one or more initiatives such as programs in Native studies, antiracism, Aboriginal cultures and crafts; visits by elders and other community members; and content in areas like indigenous languages, Aboriginal spirituality, indigenous knowledge of nature, and tours to indigenous heritage sites.[25] Although these classes are offered, most appear to be limited by the area or region in which students reside. \\"The curriculum is designed to elicit development and quality of people's cognition through the guiding of accommodations of individuals to their natural environment and their changing social order\\"[26]\\r\\nSubjects that typically get assessed (i.e., language arts, mathematics, and science) assume greater importance than non-assessed subjects (i.e., music, visual arts, and physical education) or facets of the curriculum (i.e., reading and writing versus speaking and listening).[27]\\r\\nSome scholars view academics as a form of \\"soft power\\" helping to educate and to create positive attitudes,[28] although there is criticism that educators are merely telling students what to think, instead of how to think for themselves, and using up a large proportion of classroom time in the process.[29][30] Efforts to keep students happy and socially conscious often come at the expense of academic achievement. Social promotion policies, grade inflation, lack of corrective feedback for students, teaching methods that slow the development of basic skills compared to past decades, reform mathematics, and failure to objectively track student progress have collectively forced high schools and colleges to lower their academic standards.[31][32][33]\\r\\nThe Constitution of Canada provides constitutional protections for some types of publicly funded religious-based and language-based school systems.\\r\\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 contains a guarantee for publicly funded religious-based separate schools, provided the separate schools were established by law prior to the province joining Confederation. Court cases have established that this provision did not apply to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island, since those provinces did not provide a legal guarantee for separate schools prior to Confederation. The provision did originally apply to Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador, since these provinces did have pre-existing separate schools. This constitutional provision was repealed in Quebec by a constitutional amendment in 1997, and for Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998. The constitutional provision continues to apply to Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta. There is a similar federal statutory provision which applies to the Northwest Territories.\\r\\nSection 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right of citizens who were educated in the minority language in a particular province to have their children educated in the minority language in publicly funded schools. In practice, this guarantee means that there are publicly funded English schools in Quebec, and publicly funded French schools in the other provinces and the territories.\\r\\nQuebec students must attend a French school up until the end of high school unless one of their parents qualifies as a rights-holder under s.23 of the Charter. In Ontario, French language schools automatically admit students recognized under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and may admit non-francophone students through the board's admissions committee consisting of the school principal, a school superintendent and a teacher.\\r\\nMost education programs in Canada begin in kindergarten (age five) or grade one (age six) and go to grade twelve (age 17 or 18), except in Quebec, where students finish a year earlier. After completion of a secondary school diploma, students may go on to post-secondary studies.\\r\\nNormally, for each type of publicly funded school (such as Public English or Public French), the province is divided into districts (or divisions). For each district, board members (trustees) are elected only by its supporters within the district (voters receive a ballot for just one of the boards in their area). Normally, all publicly funded schools are under the authority of their local district school board. These school boards would follow a common curriculum set up by the province the board resides in. Only Alberta allows public charter schools, which are independent of any district board. Instead, they each have their own board, which reports directly to the province.\\r\\nPrimary education and secondary education combined are sometimes referred to as K-12 (Kindergarten through Grade 12). Secondary schooling, known as high school, collegiate institute, cole secondaire or secondary school, consists of different grades depending on the province in which one resides. Furthermore, grade structure may vary within a province or even within a school division and may or may not include middle school or junior high school.\\r\\nKindergarten (or its equivalent) is available for children in all provinces in the year they turn five (except Ontario and Quebec, where it begins a year earlier), but the names of these programs, provincial funding, and the number of hours provided varies widely. For example, the Department of Education in Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary.[34]\\r\\nOntario offers two years of optional kindergarten (junior kindergarten for four-year-olds and senior kindergarten for five-year-olds). At French schools in Ontario, these programs are called Maternelle and Jardin.[35] In 2010, Ontario increased both years to full-day programs, while BC's single year of kindergarten became full-day in 2012. Quebec offers heavily subsidized preschool programs and introduced an early kindergarten program for children from low-income families in 2013. Students in the Prairie provinces are not required by statute to attend kindergarten. As a result, kindergarten often is not available in smaller towns.\\r\\nDependent on the province the age of mandatory entry to the education system is at 4ÿ7 years. Starting at grade one, at age six or seven, there is universal publicly funded access up to grade twelve (age seventeen to eighteen), except in Quebec, where secondary school ends one year earlier. Children are required to attend school until the age of sixteen (eighteen in Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick). In Quebec, the typical high school term ends after Secondary V/Grade eleven (age sixteen to seventeen); following this, students who wish to pursue their studies to the university level have to attend college (see Education in Quebec). Quebec is currently the only province where Grade 12 is part of postsecondary, though Grade 11 was also the end of secondary education in Newfoundland and Labrador prior to the introduction of grade 12 in 1983.\\r\\nOntario had a \\"Grade 13\\" known as Ontario Academic Credit (OAC) year, but this was abolished in 2003 by the provincial government to cut costs. As a result, the curriculum has been compacted, and the more difficult subjects, such as mathematics, are comparatively harder than before. However, the system is now approximately equivalent to what has been the case outside of Quebec and Ontario for many years.\\r\\nStudents may continue to attend high school until the ages of 19 to 21 (the cut-off age for high school varies between provinces). Those 19 and over may attend adult school. Students of high school age who have received long-term suspensions or have been expelled, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to attend conventional schools may be offered alternative learning options to complete their secondary education, such as drop-in programs, night school, or distance/online classes.\\r\\nAn increasing number of international students are attending pre-university courses at Canadian high schools.\\r\\nPost-secondary education in Canada is also the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. Those governments provide the majority of funding to their public post-secondary institutions, with the remainder of funding coming from tuition fees, the federal government, and research grants. Compared to other countries in the past, Canada has had the highest tertiary school enrollment as a percentage of their graduating population.[37]\\r\\nNearly all post-secondary institutions in Canada have the authority to grant academic credentials (i.e., diplomas or degrees). Generally speaking, universities grant degrees (e.g., bachelor's, master's or doctorate degrees) while colleges, which typically offer vocationally oriented programs, grant diplomas and certificates. However, some colleges offer applied arts degrees that lead to or are equivalent to degrees from a university. Private career colleges are overseen by legislative acts for each province. For example, in British Columbia training providers will be registered and accredited with the (PCTIA) Private Career Training Institutions Agency regulated under the Private Career Training Institutions Act (SBC 2003) [38] Each province with their own correlating agency. Unlike the United States, there is no \\"accreditation body\\" that oversees the universities in Canada. Universities in Canada have degree-granting authority via an Act or Ministerial Consent from the Ministry of Education of the particular province.\\r\\nPost-secondary education in Quebec begins with college following graduation from Grade 11 (or Secondary V). Students complete a two- or three-year general program leading to admission to a university, or a professional program leading directly into the labour force. In most cases, bachelor's degree programs in Quebec are three years instead of the usual four; however, in many cases, students attending a university in Quebec that did not graduate from college must complete an additional year of coursework. When Ontario had five years of high school, a three-year bachelor's degree was common, but these degrees are being phased out in favour of the four-year degree.\\r\\nThe main variation between the provinces, with respect to the universities, is the amount of funding they receive and the amount of tuition and other fees they charge.\\r\\nThe Royal Military College of Canada (RMC), is the military academy of the Canadian Forces and is a full degree-granting university. RMC is the only federal institution with degree-granting powers.\\r\\nAbout 5.6% of students are in private schools.[39] A minority of these are elite private schools, which are attended by only a small fraction of students, but do have a great deal of prestige and prominence. A far larger portion of private schools are religious based institutions. Private schools are also used to study outside the country. For example, Canadian College Italy has an Ontario curriculum, but the school is located in Italy.\\r\\nPrivate schools have historically been less common on the Canadian Prairies and were often forbidden under municipal and provincial statutes enacted to provide equality of education to students regardless of family income. This is especially true in Alberta, where successive Social Credit (or populist conservative) governments denounced the concept of private education as the main cause of denial of opportunity to the children of the working poor.\\r\\nIn the past, private universities in Canada maintained a religious history or foundation. However, since 1999, the Province of New Brunswick passed the Degree Granting Act[40] allowing private universities to operate in the Province.[41][42] The University of Fredericton is the newest university to receive designation in New Brunswick.\\r\\nTrinity Western University, in Langley British Columbia, was founded in 1962 as a junior college and received full accreditation in 1985. In 2002, British Columbia's Quest University became the first privately funded liberal arts university without a denominational affiliation (although it is not the first private liberal arts university). Many provinces, including Ontario and Alberta, have passed legislation allowing private degree-granting institutions (not necessarily universities) to operate there.\\r\\nMany Canadians remain polarized on the issue of permitting private universities into the Canadian market. On the one hand, Canada's top universities find it difficult to compete with the private American powerhouses because of funding, but on the other hand, the fact that the price of private universities tends to exclude those who cannot pay that much for their education could prevent a significant portion of Canada's population from being able to attend these schools.\\r\\nIn addition to the issue of access, some Canadians find issue with protections instituted within the Charter of Rights and Freedoms as ruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 and consistent with federal and provincial law that (private) faith-based universities in Canada based on the long established principles of freedom of conscience and religion can exempt itself from more recent human rights legislation when they insist in their community covenant code signed by staff, faculty and students that they act in accordance with the faith of the school. The covenant may require restraint from those acts considered in contradiction with the tenets of their faith such as homosexual relationships, sex outside marriage or more broadly abstain from consuming alcohol on campus or viewing pornography.[43] However, private-Christian based schools do not preclude homosexual or lesbian students from attending.[44] Some faith-based universities have been known to fire staff and faculty which refused to adhere or whose actions were in opposition with the tenets of the faith, although in some provinces, their dismissals have been successfully challenged in court based on the circumstances.[45]\\r\\nEach province deals differently with private religious schools. In Ontario the Catholic system continues to be fully publicly funded while other faiths are not. Ontario has several private Jewish, Islamic, and Christian schools all funded through tuition fees. Since the Catholic schools system is entrenched in the constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that this system is constitutional. However, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has ruled that Ontario's system is discriminatory, suggesting that Ontario either fund no faith-based schools, or all of them.[46] In 2002 the government of Mike Harris introduced a controversial program to partially fund all private schools, but this was criticized for undermining the public education system and the program was eliminated after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election.\\r\\nIn other provinces privately operated religious schools are funded. In British Columbia the government pays independent schools that meet rigorous provincial standards up to 50% of the per-student operating cost of public schools. The province has a number of Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Islamic schools. Alberta also has a network of charter schools, which are fully funded schools offering distinct approaches to education within the public school system. Alberta charter schools are not private and the province does not grant charters to religious schools. These schools have to follow the provincial curriculum and meet all standards, but are given considerable freedom in other areas. In all other provinces private religious schools receive some funding, but not as much as the public system.\\r\\nAn example of how schools can be divided by religion, Toronto has two English boards; Toronto Catholic District School Board and Toronto District School Board, and two French boards; Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud and Conseil scolaire Viamonde.\\r\\nAs the education system in Canada is managed by the varying provincial governments in Canada, the way the educational stages are grouped and named may differ from each region, or even between districts and individual schools. The ages are the age of the students when they end the school year in June.\\r\\nEnglish schools in Quebec have the same grade system as French schools, but with English names. For example, \\"elementary school\\" is not called \\"cole primaire\\" in an English school, but has the same grading system.\\r\\nThe following table shows how grades are organized in various provinces. Often, there will be exceptions within each province, both with terminology for groups, and which grades apply to each group.\\r\\nNotes:\\r\\n[50][51]","input":"What grade is a 16 year old in canada?"},{"output":"assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg","context":"","input":"What event in sarajevo led to world war 1?"},{"output":"Walt Disney","context":"Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable characters.\\r\\nMickey first appeared in the short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\\r\\nBeginning in 1930, Mickey has also been featured extensively as a comic strip character. His self-titled newspaper strip, drawn primarily by Floyd Gottfredson, ran for 45 years. Mickey has also appeared in comic books such as Disney Italy's Topolino, MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, and Wizards of Mickey, and in television series such as The Mickey Mouse Club (1955ÿ1996) and others. He also appears in other media such as video games as well as merchandising and is a meetable character at the Disney parks.\\r\\nMickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his friends Donald Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete, among others (see Mickey Mouse universe). Though originally characterized as a mischievous antihero, Mickey was rebranded over time as an everyman, usually seen as a flawed, but adventurous hero. In 2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his pleasant, cheerful side and reintroducing the more mischievous and adventurous sides of his personality, beginning with the video game Epic Mickey.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing ÿ that it was all started by a mouse.\\"\\r\\nMickey Mouse was created as a replacement for Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, an earlier cartoon character created by the Disney studio for Charles Mintz, a film producer who distributed product through Universal Studios.[4] In the spring of 1928, with the series going strong, Disney asked Mintz for an increase in the budget. But Mintz instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent budget cut, and as leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons he contractually owed Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff but determined to restart from scratch. The new Disney Studio initially consisted of animator Ub Iwerks and a loyal apprentice artist, Les Clark, who together with Wilfred Jackson were among the few who remained loyal to Walt. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1928, Disney asked Ub Iwerks to start drawing up new character ideas. Iwerks tried sketches of various animals, such as dogs and cats, but none of these appealed to Disney. A female cow and male horse were also rejected. They would later turn up as Clarabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. A male frog was also rejected. It would later show up in Iwerks' own Flip the Frog series.[5] Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from a tame mouse at his desk at Laugh-O-Gram Studio in Kansas City, Missouri.[6] In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph of Walt Disney. These inspired Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney.[5] \\"Mortimer Mouse\\" had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be.[7][8] The actor Mickey Rooney claimed that, during his Mickey McGuire days, he met cartoonist Walt Disney at the Warner Brothers studio, and that Disney was inspired to name Mickey Mouse after him.[9] This claim, however, has been debunked by Disney historian Jim Korkis, since at the time of Mickey Mouse's development, Disney Studios had been located on Hyperion Avenue for several years, and Walt Disney never kept an office or other working space at Warner Brothers, having no professional relationship with Warner Brothers, as the Alice Comedies and Oswald cartoons were distributed by Universal.[10][11]\\r\\nThroughout the earlier years, Mickey's design bore heavy resemblance to Oswald, save for the ears, nose, and tail.[12][13][14] Ub Iwerks designed Mickey's body out of circles in order to make the character simple to animate. Disney employees John Hench and Marc Davis believed that this design was part of Mickey's success as it made him more dynamic and appealing to audiences.\\r\\nMickey's circular design is most noticeable in his ears. In animation in the 1940s, Mickey's ears were animated in a more realistic perspective. Later, they were drawn to always appear circular no matter which way Mickey was facing. This made Mickey easily recognizable to audiences and made his ears an unofficial personal trademark. The circular rule later created a dilemma for toy creators who had to recreate a three-dimensional Mickey.\\r\\nIn 1938, animator Fred Moore redesigned Mickey's body away from its circular design to a pear-shaped design. Colleague Ward Kimball praised Moore for being the first animator to break from Mickey's \\"rubber hose, round circle\\" design. Although Moore himself was nervous at first about changing Mickey, Walt Disney liked the new design and told Moore \\"that's the way I want Mickey to be drawn from now on.\\"\\r\\nEach of Mickey's hands has only three fingers and a thumb. Disney said that this was both an artistic and financial decision, explaining \\"Artistically five digits are too many for a mouse. His hand would look like a bunch of bananas. Financially, not having an extra finger in each of 45,000 drawings that make up a six and one-half minute short has saved the Studio millions.\\" In the film The Opry House (1929), Mickey was first given white gloves as a way of contrasting his naturally black hands against his black body. The use of white gloves would prove to be an influential design for cartoon characters, particularly with later Disney characters, but also with non-Disney characters such as Bugs Bunny, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse, and Mario.\\r\\nMickey's eyes, as drawn in Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho, were large and white with black outlines. In Steamboat Willie, the bottom portion of the black outlines was removed, although the upper edges still contrasted with his head. Mickey's eyes were later re-imagined as only consisting of the small black dots which were originally his pupils, while what were the upper edges of his eyes became a hairline. This is evident only when Mickey blinks. Fred Moore later redesigned the eyes to be small white eyes with pupils and gave his face a Caucasian skin tone instead of plain white. This new Mickey first appeared in 1938 on the cover of a party program, and in animation the following year with the release of The Pointer.[15] Mickey is sometimes given eyebrows as seen in The Simple Things (1953) and in the comic strip, although he does not have eyebrows in his most recent appearances.\\r\\nSome of Mickey's early appearance, particularly the gloves, and facial characteristics, evolved from blackface caricatures used in minstrel shows.[16][17][18][19][20]\\r\\nBesides Mickey's gloves and shoes, he typically wears only a pair of shorts with two large buttons in the front. Before Mickey was seen regularly in color animation, Mickey's shorts were either red or a dull blue-green. With the advent of Mickey's color films, the shorts were always red. When Mickey is not wearing his red shorts, he is often still wearing red clothing such as a red bandmaster coat (The Band Concert, The Mickey Mouse Club), red overalls (Clock Cleaners, Boat Builders), a red cloak (Fantasia, Fun and Fancy Free), a red coat (Squatter's Rights, Mickey's Christmas Carol), or a red shirt (Mickey Down Under, The Simple Things).\\r\\nDisney had Ub Iwerks secretly begin animating a new cartoon while still under contract with Universal. The cartoon was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks was the main animator for the short and reportedly spent six weeks working on it. In fact, Iwerks was the main animator for every Disney short released in 1928 and 1929. Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising also assisted Disney during those years. They had already signed their contracts with Charles Mintz, but he was still in the process of forming his new studio and so for the time being they were still employed by Disney. This short would be the last they animated under this somewhat awkward situation.[21]\\r\\nMickey was first seen in a test screening of the cartoon short Plane Crazy, on May 15, 1928, but it failed to impress the audience and to add insult to injury, Walt could not find a distributor. Though understandably disappointed, Walt went on to produce a second Mickey short, The Gallopin' Gaucho, which was also not released for lack of a distributor.[22]\\r\\nSteamboat Willie was first released on November 18, 1928, in New York. It was co-directed by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks. Iwerks again served as the head animator, assisted by Johnny Cannon, Les Clark, Wilfred Jackson and Dick Lundy. This short was intended as a parody of Buster Keaton's Steamboat Bill, Jr., first released on May 12 of the same year. Although it was the third Mickey cartoon produced, it was the first to find a distributor, and thus is considered by The Disney Company as Mickey's debut. Willie featured changes to Mickey's appearance (in particular, simplifying his eyes to large dots) that established his look for later cartoons and in numerous Walt Disney films.[23][24]\\r\\nThe cartoon was not the first cartoon to feature a soundtrack connected to the action. Fleischer Studios, headed by brothers Dave and Max Fleischer, had already released a number of sound cartoons using the DeForest system in the mid-1920s. However, these cartoons did not keep the sound synchronized throughout the film. For Willie, Disney had the sound recorded with a click track that kept the musicians on the beat. This precise timing is apparent during the \\"Turkey in the Straw\\" sequence when Mickey's actions exactly match the accompanying instruments. Animation historians have long debated who had served as the composer for the film's original music. This role has been variously attributed to Wilfred Jackson, Carl Stalling and Bert Lewis, but identification remains uncertain. Walt Disney himself was voice actor for both Mickey and Minnie and would remain the source of Mickey's voice through 1946 for theatrical cartoons. Jimmy MacDonald took over the role in 1946, but Walt provided Mickey's voice again from 1955 to 1959 for The Mickey Mouse Club television series on ABC.\\r\\nAudiences at the time of Steamboat Willie's release were reportedly impressed by the use of sound for comedic purposes. Sound films or \\"talkies\\" were still considered innovative. The first feature-length movie with dialogue sequences, The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson, was released on October 6, 1927. Within a year of its success, most United States movie theaters had installed sound film equipment. Walt Disney apparently intended to take advantage of this new trend and, arguably, managed to succeed. Most other cartoon studios were still producing silent products and so were unable to effectively act as competition to Disney. As a result, Mickey would soon become the most prominent animated character of the time. Walt Disney soon worked on adding sound to both Plane Crazy and The Gallopin' Gaucho (which had originally been silent releases) and their new release added to Mickey's success and popularity. A fourth Mickey short, The Barn Dance, was also put into production; however, Mickey does not actually speak until The Karnival Kid in 1929 when his first spoken words were \\"Hot dogs, Hot dogs!\\" After Steamboat Willie was released, Mickey became a close competitor to Felix the Cat, and his popularity would grow as he was continuously featured in sound cartoons. By 1929, Felix would lose popularity among theater audiences, and Pat Sullivan decided to produce all future Felix cartoons in sound as a result.[25] Unfortunately, audiences did not respond well to Felix's transition to sound and by 1930, Felix had faded from the screen.[26]\\r\\nIn Mickey's early films he was often characterized not as a hero, but as an ineffective young suitor to Minnie Mouse. The Barn Dance (March 14, 1929) is the first time in which Mickey is turned down by Minnie in favor of Pete.\\r\\nThe Opry House (March 28, 1929) was the first time in which Mickey wore his white gloves. Mickey wears them in almost all of his subsequent appearances and many other characters followed suit. The three lines on the back of Mickey's gloves represent darts in the gloves' fabric extending from between the digits of the hand, typical of glove design of the era.\\r\\nWhen the Cat's Away (April 18, 1929), essentially a remake of the Alice Comedy, \\"Alice Rattled by Rats\\", was an unusual appearance for Mickey. Although Mickey and Minnie still maintained their anthropomorphic characteristics, they were depicted as the size of regular mice and living with a community many other mice as pests in a home. Mickey and Minnie would later appear the size of regular humans in their own setting. In appearances with real humans, Mickey has been shown to be about two to three feet high.[27] The next Mickey short was also unusual. The Barnyard Battle (April 25, 1929) was the only film to depict Mickey as a soldier and also the first to place him in combat. The Karnival Kid (1929) was the first time Mickey spoke. Before this he had only whistled, laughed, and grunted. His first words were \\"Hot dogs! Hot dogs!\\" said while trying to sell hot dogs at a carnival. Mickey's Follies (1929) introduced the song \\"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\\" which would become the theme song for Mickey Mouse films for the next several years. The \\"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\\" song sequence was also later reused with different background animation as its own special short shown only at the commencement of 1930s theater-based Mickey Mouse Clubs.[28][29] Mickey's dog Pluto first appeared as Mickey's pet in The Moose Hunt (1931) after previously appearing as Minnie's dog \\"Rover\\" in The Picnic (1930).\\r\\nThe Cactus Kid (April 11, 1930) was the last film to be animated by Ub Iwerks at Disney. Shortly before the release of the film, Iwerks left to start his own studio, bankrolled by Disney's then-distributor Pat Powers. Powers and Disney had a falling out over money due Disney from the distribution deal. It was in response to losing the right to distribute Disney's cartoons that Powers made the deal with Iwerks, who had long harbored a desire to head his own studio. The departure is considered a turning point in Mickey's career, as well as that of Walt Disney. Walt lost the man who served as his closest colleague and confidant since 1919. Mickey lost the man responsible for his original design and for the direction or animation of several of the shorts released till this point. Advertising for the early Mickey Mouse cartoons credited them as \\"A Walt Disney Comic, drawn by Ub Iwerks\\". Later Disney Company reissues of the early cartoons tend to credit Walt Disney alone.\\r\\nDisney and his remaining staff continued the production of the Mickey series, and he was able to eventually find a number of animators to replace Iwerks. As the Great Depression progressed and Felix the Cat faded from the movie screen, Mickey's popularity would rise, and by 1932 The Mickey Mouse Club would have one million members.[30] At the 5th Academy Awards in 1932, Mickey received his first Academy Award nomination, received for Mickey's Orphans (1931). Walt Disney also received an honorary Academy Award for the creation of Mickey Mouse. Despite being eclipsed by the Silly Symphonies short the Three Little Pigs in 1933, Mickey still maintained great popularity among theater audiences too, until 1935, when polls showed that Popeye was more popular than Mickey.[31][32][33] By 1934, Mickey merchandise had earned $600,000.00 a year.[34] In 1935, Disney began to phase out the Mickey Mouse Clubs, due to administration problems.[35]\\r\\nAbout this time, story artists at Disney were finding it increasingly difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited in the types of gags they could make. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In Orphan's Benefit (August 11, 1934) Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the Silly Symphonies series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.\\r\\nMickey first appeared animated in color in Parade of the Award Nominees in 1932, however, the film strip was created for the 5th Academy Awards ceremony and was not released to the public. Mickey's official first color film came in 1935 with The Band Concert. The Technicolor film process was used in the film production. Here Mickey conducted the William Tell Overture, but the band is swept up by a tornado. It is said that conductor Arturo Toscanini so loved this short that, upon first seeing it, he asked the projectionist to run it again. In 1994, The Band Concert was voted the third-greatest cartoon of all time in a poll of animation professionals. By colorizing and partially redesigning Mickey, Walt would put Mickey back on top once again, and Mickey would reach popularity he never reached before as audiences now gave him more appeal.[36] Also in 1935, Walt would receive a special award from the League of Nations for creating Mickey.\\r\\nHowever, by 1938, the more manic Donald Duck would surpass the passive Mickey, resulting in a redesign of the mouse between 1938 and 1940 that put Mickey at the peak of his popularity.[36] The second half of the 1930s saw the character Goofy reintroduced as a series regular. Together, Mickey, Donald Duck, and Goofy would go on several adventures together. Several of the films by the comic trio are some of Mickey's most critically acclaimed films, including Mickey's Fire Brigade (1935), Moose Hunters (1937), Clock Cleaners (1937), Lonesome Ghosts (1937), Boat Builders (1938), and Mickey's Trailer (1938). Also during this era, Mickey would star in Brave Little Tailor (1938), an adaptation of The Valiant Little Tailor, which was nominated for an Academy Award.\\r\\nMickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore which was first seen in The Pointer (1939). Instead of having solid black eyes, Mickey was given white eyes with pupils, a Caucasian skin colored face, and a pear-shaped body. In the 40's, he changed once more in The Little Whirlwind, where he used his trademark pants for the last time in decades, lost his tail, got more realistic ears that changed with perspective and a different body anatomy. But this change would only last for a short period of time before returning to the one in \\"The Pointer\\", with the exception of his pants. In his final theatrical cartoons in the 1950s, he was given eyebrows, which were removed in the more recent cartoons.\\r\\nIn 1940 Mickey appeared in his first feature-length film, Fantasia. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem of the same name by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chorefilling up a deep well using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski, who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.\\r\\nAfter 1940, Mickey's popularity would decline until his 1955 re-emergence as a daily children's television personality.[37] Despite this, the character continued to appear regularly in animated shorts until 1943 (winning his only competitive Academy Awardwith canine companion Plutofor a short subject, Lend a Paw) and again from 1946 to 1952.\\r\\nThe last regular installment of the Mickey Mouse film series came in 1953 with The Simple Things in which Mickey and Pluto go fishing and are pestered by a flock of seagulls.\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Mickey became more known for his appearances on television, particularly with The Mickey Mouse Club. Many of his theatrical cartoon shorts were rereleased on television series such as Ink & Paint Club, various forms of the Walt Disney anthology television series, and on home video. Mickey returned to theatrical animation in 1983 with Mickey's Christmas Carol, an adaptation of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol in which Mickey played Bob Cratchit. This was followed up in 1990 with The Prince and the Pauper.\\r\\nThroughout the decades, Mickey Mouse competed with Warner Bros.' Bugs Bunny for animated popularity. But in 1988, the two rivals finally shared screen time in the Robert Zemeckis Disney/Amblin film Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Disney and Warner signed an agreement stating that each character had the same amount of screen time in the scene.\\r\\nSimilar to his animated inclusion into a live-action film on Roger Rabbit, Mickey made a featured cameo appearance in the 1990 television special The Muppets at Walt Disney World where he met Kermit the Frog. The two are established in the story as having been old friends. The Muppets have otherwise spoofed and referenced Mickey over a dozen times since the 1970s. Eventually, The Muppets were purchased by the Walt Disney Company in 2004.\\r\\nHis most recent theatrical cartoon short was 2013's Get a Horse! which was preceded by 1995's Runaway Brain, while from 1999 to 2004, he appeared in direct-to-video features like Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers and the computer-animated Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas.\\r\\nMany television series have centered on Mickey, such as the ABC shows Mickey Mouse Works (1999ÿ2000), Disney's House of Mouse (2001ÿ2003), Disney Channel's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse (2006ÿ2016), and Mickey and the Roadster Racers (2017ÿ). Prior to all these, Mickey was also featured as an unseen character in the Bonkers episode \\"You Oughta Be In Toons\\".\\r\\nMickey has recently been announced to star in two films. One is being based on the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort, while the other is a film idea pitched by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran Burny Mattinson centering on Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.[38]\\r\\nSince June 28, 2013, Disney Channel has been airing new 3-minute Mickey Mouse shorts, with animator Paul Rudish at the helm, incorporating elements of Mickey's late twenties-early thirties look with a contemporary twist.[39]\\r\\nA large part of Mickey's screen persona is his famously shy, falsetto voice. From 1928 onward, Mickey was voiced by Walt Disney himself, a task in which Disney took great personal pride. However, by 1946, Disney was becoming too busy with running the studio to do regular voice work which meant he could not do Mickey's voice anymore. It is also speculated that his cigarette habit had damaged his voice over the years. After recording the Mickey and the Beanstalk section of Fun and Fancy Free, Mickey's voice was handed over to veteran Disney musician and actor Jimmy MacDonald. MacDonald voiced Mickey in the remainder of the theatrical shorts, and for various television and publicity projects up until his retirement in the mid-1970s, although Walt voiced Mickey again for the introductions to the original 1955ÿ1959 run of The Mickey Mouse Club TV series, the \\"Fourth Anniversary Show\\" episode of the Disneyland TV series that aired on September 11, 1958, and the Disneyland USA at Radio City Music Hall show from 1962.[40] Composer Carl W. Stalling was the very first person to provide lines for Mickey in the 1929 short The Karnival Kid. Clarence Nash voiced Mickey in the 1934 Disney short, The Dognapper; around the time when it was filmed, Walt was traveling in Europe and was unavailable to record his lines for Mickey for the short. Along with Disney, J. Donald Wilson, Joe Twerp, and John Hiestand provided the voice in 1938 broadcasts of The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air.[41] Stan Freberg voiced Mickey in the Freberg-produced record Mickey Mouse's Birthday Party. Alan Young voiced Mickey in the Disneyland record album An Adaptation of Dickens' Christmas Carol, Performed by The Walt Disney Players in 1974, which it would be the first and only time that Alan Young voices him.[42][43]\\r\\nThe 1983 short film Mickey's Christmas Carol marked the theatrical debut of Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse, who was the official voice of Mickey from 1977 until his death in 2009.[44] Allwine once recounted something MacDonald had told him about voicing Mickey: \\"The main piece of advice that Jim gave me about Mickey helped me keep things in perspective. He said, 'Just remember kid, you're only filling in for the boss.' And that's the way he treated doing Mickey for years and years. From Walt, and now from Jimmy.\\"[45] Allwine would eventually marry Russi Taylor, the voice of Minnie Mouse since 1986. Les Perkins did the voice of Mickey in two TV specials, \\"Down and Out with Donald Duck\\" and \\"DTV Valentine\\" in the mid-1980s. Peter Renaday voiced Mickey in the 1980s Disney albums Yankee Doodle Mickey and Mickey Mouse Splashdance.[46][47] He also provided his voice for The Talking Mickey Mouse toy in 1986.[48][49] Quinton Flynn briefly filled in for Allwine as the voice of Mickey in a few episodes of the first season of Mickey Mouse Works whenever Allwine was unavailable to record.[50]\\r\\nBret Iwan, a former Hallmark greeting card artist, is the current voice of Mickey. Iwan was originally cast as an understudy for Allwine due to the latters declining health; however, Allwine died before Iwan could meet him, and Iwan became the new official voice for Mickey. Iwans early recordings in 2009 included work for the Disney Cruise Line, Mickey toys, theme parks, and also the Disney on Ice: Celebrations! ice show.[51] He directly replaced Allwine as Mickey for the Kingdom Hearts video game series and the series Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. His first video game voice-over of Mickey Mouse can be found on Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep, a video game for PlayStation Portable. Iwan also became the first voice actor to portray Mickey during Disneys rebranding of the character, providing the vocal effects of Mickey in the games Epic Mickey as well as his voice in Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two and the remake of Castle of Illusion. Despite Iwan being Mickey's primary voice actor, the character's voice is provided by Chris Diamantopoulos in the 2013 animated series,[52] as the producers were looking for a voice closer to Walt Disneys portrayal of the character in order to match the vintage look of the series.[53]\\r\\nMickey first appeared in comics after he had appeared in 15 commercially successful animated shorts and was easily recognized by the public. Walt Disney was approached by King Features Syndicate with the offer to license Mickey and his supporting characters for use in a comic strip. Disney accepted and Mickey made his first comic strip appearance on January 13, 1930. The comical plot was credited to Disney himself, art to Ub Iwerks and inking to Win Smith. The first week or so of the strip featured a loose adaptation of \\"Plane Crazy\\". Minnie soon became the first addition to the cast. The strips first released between January 13, 1930, and March 31, 1930, has been occasionally reprinted in comic book form under the collective title \\"Lost on a Desert Island\\". Animation historian Jim Korkis notes \\"After the eighteenth strip, Iwerks left and his inker, Win Smith, continued drawing the gag-a-day format...\\"[54]\\r\\nIn early 1930, after Iwerks' departure, Disney was at first content to continue scripting the Mickey Mouse comic strip, assigning the art to Win Smith. However, Disney's focus had always been in animation and Smith was soon assigned with the scripting as well. Smith was apparently discontent at the prospect of having to script, draw, and ink a series by himself as evidenced by his sudden resignation.\\r\\nDisney then searched for a replacement among the remaining staff of the Studio. He selected Floyd Gottfredson, a recently hired employee. At the time Gottfredson was reportedly eager to work in animation and somewhat reluctant to accept his new assignment. Disney had to assure him the assignment was only temporary and that he would eventually return to animation. Gottfredson accepted and ended up holding this \\"temporary\\" assignment from May 5, 1930, to November 15, 1975.\\r\\nWalt Disney's last script for the strip appeared May 17, 1930.[54] Gottfredson's first task was to finish the storyline Disney had started on April 1, 1930. The storyline was completed on September 20, 1930, and later reprinted in comic book form as Mickey Mouse in Death Valley. This early adventure expanded the cast of the strip which to this point only included Mickey and Minnie. Among the characters who had their first comic strip appearances in this story were Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Black Pete as well as the debuts of corrupted lawyer Sylvester Shyster and Minnie's uncle Mortimer Mouse. The Death Valley narrative was followed by Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers, first printed between September 22 and December 26, 1930, which introduced Marcus Mouse and his wife as Minnie's parents.\\r\\nStarting with these two early comic strip stories, Mickey's versions in animation and comics are considered to have diverged from each other. While Disney and his cartoon shorts would continue to focus on comedy, the comic strip effectively combined comedy and adventure. This adventurous version of Mickey would continue to appear in comic strips and later comic books throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.\\r\\nFloyd Gottfredson left his mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion (1936) and The Gleam (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip over the years included Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, Bill Walsh, Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.\\r\\nThe next artist to leave his mark on the character was Paul Murry in Dell Comics. His first Mickey tale appeared in 1950 but Mickey did not become a specialty until Murry's first serial for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories in 1953 (\\"The Last Resort\\"). In the same period, Romano Scarpa in Italy for the magazine Topolino began to revitalize Mickey in stories that brought back the Phantom Blot and Eega Beeva along with new creations such as the Atomo Bleep-Bleep. While the stories at Western Publishing during the Silver Age emphasized Mickey as a detective in the style of Sherlock Holmes, in the modern era several editors and creators have consciously undertaken to depict a more vigorous Mickey in the mold of the classic Gottfredson adventures. This renaissance has been spearheaded by Byron Erickson, David Gerstein, Noel Van Horn, Michael T. Gilbert and Csar Ferioli.\\r\\nIn Europe, Mickey Mouse became the main attraction of a number of comics magazines, the most famous being Topolino in Italy from 1932 on, Le Journal de Mickey in France from 1934 on, Don Miki in Spain and the Greek Miky Maous.\\r\\nMickey was the main character for the series MM Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, published in Italy from 1999 to 2001.\\r\\nIn 2006, he appeared in the Italian fantasy comic saga Wizards of Mickey.\\r\\nIn 1958, Mickey Mouse was introduced to the Arab world through another comic book called Sameer. He became very popular in Egypt and got a comic book with his name. Mickeys comics in Egypt are licensed by Disney and were published since 1959 by Dar Al-Hilal and they were success, however Dar Al-Hilal stopped the publication in 2003 because of problems with Disney. The comics were re-released by \\"Nahdat Masr\\" in 2004 and the first issues were sold out in less than 8 hours.[55]\\r\\nSince his early years, Mickey Mouse has been licensed by Disney to appear on many different kinds of merchandise. Mickey was produced as plush toys and figurines, and Mickey's image has graced almost everything from T-shirts to lunchboxes. Largely responsible for Disney merchandising in the 1930s was Kay Kamen (d. 1949) who was called a \\"stickler for quality.\\" Kamen was recognized by The Walt Disney Company as having a significant part in Mickey's rise to stardom and was named a Disney Legend in 1998.[56] At the time of his 80th-anniversary celebration in 2008, Time declared Mickey Mouse one of the world's most recognized characters, even when compared against Santa Claus.[57] Disney officials have stated that 98% of children aged 3ÿ11 around the world are at least aware of the character.[57]\\r\\nMickey was most famously featured on wrist watches and alarm clocks, typically utilizing his hands as the actual hands on the face of the clock. The first Mickey Mouse watches were manufactured in 1933 by the Ingersoll Watch Company. The seconds were indicated by a turning disk below Mickey. The first Mickey watch was sold at the Century of Progress in Chicago, 1933 for $3.75. Mickey Mouse watches have been sold by other companies and designers throughout the years, including Timex, Elgin, Helbros, Bradley, Lorus, and Grald Genta[58] The fictional character Robert Langdon from Dan Brown's novels was said to wear a Mickey Mouse watch as a reminder \\"to stay young at heart.\\"[59]\\r\\nIn 1989, Milton Bradley released the electronic talking game titled Mickey Says, with three modes featuring Mickey Mouse as its host. Mickey also appeared in other toys and games, including the Worlds of Wonder released The Talking Mickey Mouse.\\r\\nFisher-Price has recently produced a line of talking animatronic Mickey dolls including \\"Dance Star Mickey\\" (2010)[60] and \\"Rock Star Mickey\\" (2011).[61]\\r\\nIn total, approximately 40% of Disney's revenues for consumer products are derived from Mickey Mouse merchandise, with revenues peaking in 1997.[57]\\r\\nAs the official Walt Disney mascot, Mickey has played a central role in the Disney parks since the opening of Disneyland in 1955. As with other characters, Mickey is often portrayed by a non-speaking costumed actor. In this form, he has participated in ceremonies and countless parades. A popular activity with guests is getting to meet and pose for photographs with the mouse. As of the presidency of Barack Obama (who jokingly referred to him as \\"a world leader who has bigger ears than me\\")[62] Mickey has met every U.S. President since Harry Truman, with the exception of Lyndon B. Johnson.[14]\\r\\nMickey also features in several specific attractions at the Disney parks. Mickey's Toontown (Disneyland and Tokyo Disneyland) is a themed land which is a recreation of Mickey's neighborhood. Buildings are built in a cartoon style and guests can visit Mickey or Minnie's houses, Donald Duck's boat, or Goofy's garage. This is a common place to meet the characters.[63]\\r\\nMickey's PhilharMagic (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, Hong Kong Disneyland) is a 4D film which features Mickey in the familiar role of symphony conductor. At Main Street Cinema several of Mickey's short films are shown on a rotating basis; the sixth film is always Steamboat Willie. Mickey plays a central role in Fantasmic! (Disneyland Resort, Disney's Hollywood Studios) a live nighttime show which famously features Mickey in his role as the Sorcerer's Apprentice. Mickey was also a central character in the now-defunct Mickey Mouse Revue (Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland) which was an indoor show featuring animatronic characters. Mickey's face currently graces the Mickey's Fun Wheel at Disney California Adventure Park, where a figure of him also stands on top of Silly Symphony Swings.\\r\\nIn addition to Mickey's overt presence in the parks, numerous images of him are also subtly included in sometimes unexpected places. This phenomenon is known as \\"Hidden Mickey\\", involving hidden images in Disney films, theme parks, and merchandise.\\r\\nLike many popular characters, Mickey has starred in many video games, including Mickey Mousecapade on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse, Mickey's Ultimate Challenge, and Disney's Magical Quest on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse on the Mega Drive/Genesis, Mickey Mouse: Magic Wands! on the Game Boy, and many others. In the 2000s, the Disney's Magical Quest series were ported to the Game Boy Advance, while Mickey made his sixth generation era debut in Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse, a Nintendo GameCube title aimed at younger audiences. Mickey plays a major role in the Kingdom Hearts series, as the king of Disney Castle and aide to the protagonist, Sora. King Mickey wields the Keyblade, a weapon in the form of a key that has the power to open any lock and combat darkness. Epic Mickey, featuring a darker version of the Disney universe, was released in 2010 for the Wii. The game is part of an effort by The Walt Disney Company to re-brand the Mickey Mouse character by moving away from his current squeaky clean image and reintroducing the mischievous side of his personality.[3]\\r\\nMickey Mouse has received ten nominations for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. These are Mickey's Orphans (1931), Building a Building (1933), Brave Little Tailor (1938), The Pointer (1939), Lend a Paw (1941), Squatter's Rights (1946), Mickey and the Seal (1948), Mickey's Christmas Carol (1983), Runaway Brain (1995), and Get a Horse! (2013). Among these, Lend a Paw was the only film to actually win the award. Additionally, in 1932 Walt Disney received an honorary Academy Award in recognition of Mickey's creation and popularity.\\r\\nIn 1994, four of Mickey's cartoons were included in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons which listed the greatest cartoons of all time as voted by members of the animation field. The films were The Band Concert (#3), Steamboat Willie (#13), Brave Little Tailor (#26), and Clock Cleaners (#27).\\r\\nOn November 18, 1978, in honor of his 50th anniversary, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located on 6925 Hollywood Blvd.\\r\\nMelbourne (Australia) runs the annual Moomba festival street procession and appointed Mickey Mouse as their King of Moomba (1977).[64]:17ÿ22 Although immensely popular with children, there was controversy with the appointment: some Melburnians wanted a 'home-grown' choice, e.g. Blinky Bill; when it was revealed that Patricia O'Carroll (from Disneyland's Disney on Parade show) was performing the mouse, Australian newspapers reported \\"Mickey Mouse is really a girl!\\"[64]:19ÿ20\\r\\nMickey was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day 2005. He was the first cartoon character to receive the honor and only the second fictional character after Kermit the Frog in 1996.\\r\\nIn the United States, protest votes are often made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure. Since most states' electoral systems do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of \\"None of the Above\\", most protest votes take the form of a clearly non-serious candidate's name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose.[65][66] As an election supervisor in Georgia observed, \\"If [Mickey Mouse] doesnt get votes in our election, its a bad election.\\"[67] The earliest known mention of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections.[68]\\r\\nMickey Mouse's name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, such as in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.[69][70]\\r\\n\\"Mickey Mouse\\" is a slang expression meaning small-time, amateurish or trivial. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it also means poor quality or counterfeit. However, in parts of Australia it can mean excellent or very good (rhyming slang for \\"grouse\\").[71] Examples of the former two of the three usages include the following:\\r\\nMickey Mouse's global fame has made him both a symbol of The Walt Disney Company and of the United States itself. For this reason, Mickey has been used frequently in anti-American satire, such as the infamous underground cartoon \\"Mickey Mouse in Vietnam\\" (1969). There have been numerous parodies of Mickey Mouse, such as the 2-page parody \\"Mickey Rodent\\" by Will Elder (published in Mad #19, 1955) in which the mouse walks around unshaven and jails Donald Duck out of jealousy over the duck's larger popularity.[79] The grotesque Rat Fink character was created by Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth over his hatred of Mickey Mouse. In The Simpsons Movie, Bart Simpson puts a black bra on his head to mimic Mickey Mouse and says: \\"I'm the mascot of an evil corporation!\\"[80] On the Comedy Central series South Park, Mickey is depicted as the sadistic, greedy, foul-mouthed boss of The Walt Disney Company, only interested in money. He also appears briefly with Donald Duck in the comic Squeak the Mouse by the Italian cartoonist Massimo Mattioli.\\r\\nIn an episode of \\"Full Frontal Nerdity,\\" by Aaron Williams, Mickey is shown as desperately trying to unload Miramax.[81]\\r\\nIn Bored of the Rings, Mickey Mouse is satirized as Dickey Dragon.\\r\\nLike all major Disney characters, Mickey Mouse is not only copyrighted but also trademarked, which lasts in perpetuity as long as it continues to be used commercially by its owner. So, whether or not a particular Disney cartoon goes into the public domain, the characters themselves may not be used as trademarks without authorization.\\r\\nBecause of the Copyright Term Extension Act of the United States (sometimes called the 'Mickey Mouse Protection Act' because of extensive lobbying by the Disney corporation) and similar legislation within the European Union and other jurisdictions where copyright terms have been extended, works such as the early Mickey Mouse cartoons will remain under copyright until at least 2023. However, some copyright scholars argue that Disney's copyright on the earliest version of the character may be invalid due to ambiguity in the copyright notice for Steamboat Willie.[82]\\r\\nThe Walt Disney Company has become well known for protecting its trademark on the Mickey Mouse characterwhose likeness is closely associated with the companywith particular zeal. In 1989, Disney threatened legal action against three daycare centers in Florida for having Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters painted on their walls. The characters were removed, and rival Universal Studios replaced them with Universal cartoon characters.[83]\\r\\nIn 1971, a group of underground cartoonists calling themselves the Air Pirates, after a group of villains from early Mickey Mouse films, produced a comic called Air Pirates Funnies. In the first issue, cartoonist Dan O'Neill depicted Mickey and Minnie Mouse engaging in explicit sexual behavior and consuming drugs. As O'Neill explained, \\"The air pirates weresome sort of bizarre concept to steal the air, pirate the air, steal the media.Since we were cartoonists, the logical thing was Disney.\\"[84] Rather than change the appearance or name of the character, which O'Neill felt would dilute the parody, the mouse depicted in Air Pirates Funnies looks like and is named \\"Mickey Mouse\\". Disney sued for copyright infringement, and after a series of appeals, O'Neill eventually lost and was ordered to pay Disney $1.9 million. The outcome of the case remains controversial among free-speech advocates. New York Law School professor Edward Samuels said, \\"[The Air Pirates] set parody back twenty years.\\"[85][better?source?needed]\\r\\nIn 1930, The German Board of Film Censors prohibited any presentations of the Mickey Mouse cartoon The Barnyard Battle (1929). The animated short, which features the mouse as a kepi-wearing soldier fighting cat enemies in German-style helmets, was viewed by censors as a negative portrayal of Germany.[86] It was claimed by the board that the film would \\"reawaken the latest anti-German feeling existing abroad since the War\\".[87] The Barnyard Battle incident did not incite wider anti-Mickey sentiment in Germany in 1930; however, after Adolf Hitler came to power several years later, the Nazi regime unambiguously propagandized against Disney. A mid-1930s German newspaper article read:\\r\\n\\"Mickey Mouse is the most miserable ideal ever revealed...Healthy emotions tell every independent young man and every honorable youth that the dirty and filth-covered vermin, the greatest bacteria carrier in the animal kingdom, cannot be the ideal type of animal...Away with Jewish brutalization of the people! Down with Mickey Mouse! Wear the Swastika Cross!\\"[88][89][90]\\r\\nAmerican cartoonist and writer Art Spiegelman would later use this quote on the opening page of the second volume of his graphic novel Maus.\\r\\nIn 1935 Romanian authorities also banned Mickey Mouse films from cinemas, purportedly fearing that children would be \\"scared to see a ten-foot mouse in the movie theatre\\".[91] In 1938, based on the Ministry of Popular Culture's recommendation that a reform was necessary \\"to raise children in the firm and imperialist spirit of the Fascist revolution,\\" the Italian Government banned foreign children's literature[92] except Mickey; Disney characters were exempted from the decree for the \\"acknowledged artistic merit\\" of Disney's work.[93] Actually, Mussolini's children were fond of Mickey Mouse, so they managed to delay his ban as long as possible.[94] In 1942, after Italy declared war on the United States, fascism immediately forced Italian publishers to stop printing any Disney stories. Mickey's stories were replaced by the adventures of Tuffolino, a new human character created by Federico Pedrocchi (script) and Pier Lorenzo De Vita (art). After the downfall of Italy's fascist government in 1945, the ban was removed.\\r\\nMickey has been announced to star in two films. One is a live-action/CGI hybrid film based on the Magic Kingdom theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort,[95] while the other is a film idea pitched by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran Burny Mattinson centering on Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.[38]","input":"What is the original voice of mickey mouse?"},{"output":"Washington, D.C.","context":"The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants.\\r\\nThe original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts, though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the United States Congress and its predecessors had met in Philadelphia (Independence Hall and Congress Hall), New York City (Federal Hall), and a number of other locations (York, Pennsylvania; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland; and Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey).[2] In September 1774, the First Continental Congress brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia, followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775 to March 1781.\\r\\nAfter adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania, the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton, New Jersey, on June 21, 1783,[3] and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City.\\r\\nThe United States Congress was established upon ratification of the United States Constitution and formally began on March 4, 1789. New York City remained home to Congress until July 1790,[4] when the Residence Act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital. The decision to locate the capital was contentious, but Alexander Hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War, in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the Potomac River. As part of the legislation, Philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years (until December 1800), until the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., would be ready.[5]\\r\\nPierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city.[6] L'Enfant chose Jenkin's Hill as the site for the \\"Congress House\\", with a \\"grand avenue\\" (now Pennsylvania Avenue, NW) connecting it with the President's House, and a public space containing a broader \\"grand avenue\\" (now the National Mall) stretching westward to the Potomac River (see: L'Enfant Plan).[7][8]\\r\\nIn reviewing L'Enfant's plan, Thomas Jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the \\"Capitol\\" rather than \\"Congress House\\".[7] The word \\"Capitol\\" comes from Latin and is associated with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on Capitoline Hill, one of the seven hills of Rome.[9][10] The connection between the two is not, however, crystal clear.[11] In addition to coming up with a city plan, L'Enfant had been tasked with designing the Capitol and President's House; however, he was dismissed in February 1792 over disagreements with President George Washington and the commissioners, and there were no plans at that point for the Capitol.[12]\\r\\nIn spring 1792, United States Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the Capitol and the \\"President's House\\", and set a four-month deadline. The prize for the competition was $500 and a lot in the Federal City. At least ten individuals submitted designs for the Capitol; however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish, reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the United States at the time.[13] The most promising of the submissions was by Stephen Hallet, a trained French architect.[14] However, Hallet's designs were overly fancy, with too much French influence, and were deemed too costly.[15]\\r\\nA late entry by amateur architect William Thornton was submitted on January 31, 1793, to much praise for its \\"Grandeur, Simplicity, and Beauty\\" by Washington, along with praise from Thomas Jefferson. Thornton was inspired by the east front of the Louvre, as well as the Paris Pantheon for the center portion of the design.[16][17] Thornton's design was officially approved in a letter dated April 5, 1793, from Washington, and Thornton served as the first Architect of the Capitol (and later first Superintendent of the United States Patent Office).[18] In an effort to console Hallet, the commissioners appointed him to review Thornton's plans, develop cost estimates, and serve as superintendent of construction. Hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to Thornton's design, which he saw as costly to build and problematic.[19] In July 1793, Jefferson convened a five-member commission, bringing Hallet and Thornton together, along with James Hoban (winning architect of the \\"President's Palace\\") to address problems with and revise Thornton's plan. Hallet suggested changes to the floor plan, which could be fitted within the exterior design by Thornton.[20][21] The revised plan was accepted, except that Secretary Jefferson and President Washington insisted on an open recess in the center of the East front, which was part of Thornton's original plan.[22]\\r\\nThe original design by Thornton was later modified by the famous British-American architects Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Sr., and then Charles Bulfinch.[23] The current cast-iron dome and the House's new southern extension and Senate new northern wing were designed by Thomas U. Walter and August Schoenborn, a German immigrant, in the 1850s,[24] and were completed under the supervision of Edward Clark.[25]\\r\\nL'Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and along Aquia Creek in Virginia for use in the foundations and outer walls of the Capitol in November 1791.[26] Surveying was under way soon after the Jefferson conference plan for the Capitol was accepted.[20] On September 18, 1793, President George Washington, along with eight other Freemasons dressed in masonic regalia, laid the cornerstone, which was made by silversmith Caleb Bentley.[27][28]\\r\\nConstruction proceeded with Hallet working under supervision of James Hoban, who was also busy working on construction of the \\"President's House\\" (also later known as the \\"Executive Mansion\\"). Despite the wishes of Jefferson and the President, Hallet went ahead anyway and modified Thornton's design for the East Front and created a square central court that projected from the center, with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies. Hallet was dismissed by Secretary Jefferson on November 15, 1794.[29] George Hadfield was hired on October 15, 1795, as Superintendent of Construction, but resigned three years later in May 1798, because of his dissatisfaction with Thornton's plan and quality of work done thus far.[30]\\r\\nThe Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would someday rise. However, the House of Representatives moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the United States Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800. The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as President.[31]\\r\\nFor several decades, beginning when the federal government moved to Washington in the fall of 1800, the Capitol building was used for Sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions. The first services were conducted in the \\"hall\\" of the House in the north wing of the building. In 1801 the House moved to temporary quarters in the south wing, called the \\"Oven,\\" which it vacated in 1804, returning to the north wing for three years. Then, from 1807 to 1857, they were held in the then-House Chamber (now called Statuary Hall). When held in the House chamber, the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit. According to the U.S. Library of Congress exhibit Religion and the Founding of the American Republic:\\r\\nIt is no exaggeration to say that on Sundays in Washington during the administrations of Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809) and of James Madison (1809-1817) the state became the church. Within a year of his inauguration, Jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the House of Representatives. Madison followed Jefferson's example, although unlike Jefferson, who rode on horseback to church in the Capitol, Madison came in a coach and four. Worship services in the Housea practice that continued until after the Civil Warwere acceptable to Jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary. Preachers of every Protestant denomination appeared. (Catholic priests began officiating in 1826.) As early as January 1806 a female evangelist, Dorothy Ripley, delivered a camp meeting-style exhortation in the House to Jefferson, Vice President Aaron Burr, and a \\"crowded audience.\\"[32]\\r\\nNot long after the completion of both wings, the Capitol was partially burned by the British on August 24, 1814, during the War of 1812. George Bomford and Joseph Gardner Swift, both military engineers, were called upon to help rebuild the Capitol. Reconstruction began in 1815 and included redesigned chambers for both Senate and House wings (now sides), which were completed by 1819. During the reconstruction, Congress met in the Old Brick Capitol, a temporary structure financed by local investors. Construction continued through to 1826, with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior Rotunda, rising above the first low dome of the Capitol. Latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features; his successor, Bulfinch, also played a major role, such as the design of the first low dome covered in copper.\\r\\nBy 1850, it became clear that the Capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states. A new design competition was held, and President Millard Fillmore appointed Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter to carry out the expansion. Two new wings were added ÿ a new chamber for the House of Representatives on the south side, and a new chamber for the Senate on the north.[33]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol was expanded in the 1850s, some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves \\"who cut the logs, laid the stones and baked the bricks\\".[34] The original plan was to use workers brought in from Europe; however, there was a poor response to recruitment efforts, and African Americans, some free and some enslaved, composed the majority of the work force.[35]\\r\\nThe 1850 expansion more than doubled the length of the Capitol, dwarfing the original, timber-framed, copper-sheeted, low dome of 1818, designed by Charles Bulfinch and no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building. In 1855, the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the \\"wedding-cake style\\" cast-iron dome that stands today. Also designed by Thomas U. Walter, the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and 100 feet (30?m) in diameter, yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers. Like Mansart's dome at \\"Les Invalides\\" (which he had visited in 1838), Walter's dome is double, with a large oculus in the inner dome, through which is seen \\"The Apotheosis of Washington\\" painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs, which also support the visible exterior structure and the tholos that supports The \\"Statue of Freedom\\", a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in 1863. This statue was cast by a slave named Philip Reid. The weight of the cast iron for the dome has been published as 8,909,200 pounds (4,041,100?kg).[36]\\r\\nWhen the Capitol's new dome was finally completed, its massive visual weight, in turn, overpowered the proportions of the columns of the East Portico, built in 1828. The East Front of the Capitol building was rebuilt in 1904, following a design of the architects Carrre and Hastings, who also designed the Russell Senate and Cannon House office buildings.\\r\\nThe next major expansion to the Capitol started in 1958, with a 33.5 feet (10.2?m) extension of the East Portico.[citation needed] During this project, in 1960 the dome underwent a restoration.[37] A marble duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built 33.5 feet (10.2?m) from the old Front. (In 1962, a connecting extension incorporated what had been an outside wall as an inside wall.) In the process, the Corinthian columns were removed. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer Russell Page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U.S. National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol Columns, where they are combined with a reflecting pool in an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis, in Persia. Besides the columns, hundreds of blocks of the original stone were removed and are stored behind a National Park Service maintenance yard in Rock Creek Park.[38]\\r\\nOn December 19, 1960, the Capitol was declared a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service.[39] The building was ranked #6 in a 2007 survey conducted for the American Institute of Architects' \\"America's Favorite Architecture\\" list.[40] The Capitol draws heavily from other notable buildings, especially churches and landmarks in Europe, including the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican and St. Paul's Cathedral in London.[41] On the roofs of the Senate and House Chambers are flagpoles that fly the U.S. flag when either is in session. On September 18, 1993, to commemorate the Capitol's bicentennial, the Masonic ritual cornerstone laying with George Washington was reenacted. U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond was one of the Freemason politicians who took part in the ceremony.\\r\\nOn June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center, which opened on December 2, 2008.[42] From 2001 through 2008, the East Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of construction for this massive underground complex, designed to facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol. Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space for building necessities such as an underground service tunnel.\\r\\nA large-scale Capitol dome restoration project, the first extensive such work since 1959ÿ1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled before the 2017 presidential inauguration.[43] As of 2012, $20 million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed, but other deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed. Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The House wanted to spend less on government operations,[37] but in late 2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two years, starting in spring 2014.[44] Extensive scaffolding was erected in 2014, enclosing and obscuring the dome.[43] All exterior scaffolding was removed by mid-September 2016.[45]\\r\\nThe Capitol building is marked by its central dome above a rotunda in the central section of the structure (which also includes, the older original smaller center flanked by the two original (designed 1793, occupied 1800) smaller two wings (inner north) and inner south) containing the two original smaller meeting chambers for the Senate and the House of Representatives (between 1800 and late 1850s) and then flanked by two further extended (newer) wings, one also for each chamber of the larger, more populous Congress: the new north wing is the Senate chamber and the new south wing is the House of Representatives chamber. Above these newer chambers are galleries where visitors can watch the Senate and House of Representatives. It is an example of the neoclassical architecture style.\\r\\nUnderground tunnels and internal subways connect the Capitol building with the Congressional office buildings in the Capitol Complex. All rooms in the Capitol are designated as either S (for Senate) or H (for House), depending on whether they are in the Senate or House wing of the Capitol.\\r\\nThe Capitol has a long history in art of the United States, beginning in 1856 with Italian/Greek American artist Constantino Brumidi and his murals in the hallways of the first floor of the Senate side of the Capitol. The murals, known as the Brumidi Corridors,[46] reflect great moments and people in United States history. Among the original works are those depicting Benjamin Franklin, John Fitch, Robert Fulton, and events such as the Cession of Louisiana. Also decorating the walls are animals, insects and natural flora indigenous to the United States. Brumidi's design left many spaces open so that future events in United States history could be added. Among those added are the Spirit of St. Louis, the Moon landing, and the Space Shuttle Challenger shuttle crew.\\r\\nBrumidi also worked within the Rotunda. He is responsible for the painting of \\"The Apotheosis of Washington\\" beneath the top of the dome, and also the famous \\"Frieze of American History\\".[47] \\"The Apotheosis of Washington\\" was completed in 11 months and painted by Brumidi while suspended nearly 180 feet (55?m) in the air. It is said to be the first attempt by the United States to deify a founding father. Washington is depicted surrounded by 13 maidens in an inner ring with many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses below him in a second ring. The frieze is located around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological, pictorial history of the United States from the landing of Christopher Columbus to the Wright Brothers's flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The frieze was started in 1878 and was not completed until 1953. The frieze was therefore painted by four different artists: Brumidi, Filippo Costaggini, Charles Ayer Whipple, and Allyn Cox. The final scenes depicted in the fresco had not yet occurred when Brumidi began his \\"Frieze of the United States History\\".\\r\\nWithin the Rotunda there are eight large paintings about the development of the United States as a nation. On the east side are four paintings depicting major events in the discovery of America. On the west are four paintings depicting the founding of the United States. The east side paintings include The Baptism of Pocahontas by John Gadsby Chapman, The Embarkation of the Pilgrims by Robert Walter Weir, The Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell, and The Landing of Columbus by John Vanderlyn. The paintings on the west side are by John Trumbull: Declaration of Independence, Surrender of General Burgoyne, Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, and General George Washington Resigning His Commission. Trumbull was a contemporary of the United States' founding fathers and a participant in the American Revolutionary War; he painted a self-portrait into Surrender of Lord Cornwallis.\\r\\nFirst Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln hangs over the west staircase in the Senate wing.[48]\\r\\nThe Capitol also houses the National Statuary Hall Collection, comprising two statues donated by each of the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the National Statuary Hall is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha donated by the state of Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of 15,000 pounds (6,800?kg) raised concerns that it might come crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of Po'pay from the state of New Mexico, was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.\\r\\nOn the ground floor is an area known as the Crypt. It was intended to be the burial place of George Washington, with a ringed balustrade at the center of the Rotunda above looking down to his tomb. However, under the stipulations of his last will, Washington was buried at Mount Vernon. The Crypt houses exhibits on the history of the Capitol. A compass star inlaid in the floor marks the point at which Washington, D.C. is divided into its four quadrants and is the basis for how addresses in Washington, D.C., are designated (NE, NW, SE, or SW). However, due to the retrocession of the Virginia portions of the District, the geographic center of the city lies near the White House.\\r\\nWithin the Crypt is Gutzon Borglum's massive Abraham Lincoln Bust. The sculptor had a fascination with large-scale art and themes of heroic nationalism, and carved the piece from a six-ton block of marble. Borglum carved the bust in 1908, and it was donated to the Congress by Eugene Meyer, Jr., and accepted by the Joint Committee on the Library, in the same year. The pedestal was specially designed by the sculptor and installed in 1911. The bust and pedestal were on display in the Rotunda for many years until 1979 when, after a rearrangement of all sculpture in the Rotunda, they were placed in the Crypt.[49] Borglum was a patriot; believing that the \\"monuments we have built are not our own,\\" he looked to create art that was \\"American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement\\", according to a 1908 interview article. Borglum's depiction of Lincoln was so accurate, that Robert Todd Lincoln, the president's son, praised the bust as \\"the most extraordinarily good portrait of my father I have ever seen.\\"[49] Supposedly, according to legend, the marble head remains unfinished (missing a left ear) to symbolize Lincoln's unfinished life.\\r\\nAt one end of the room near the Old Supreme Court Chamber is a statue of John C. Calhoun. On the right leg of the statue, a mark from a bullet fired during the 1998 shooting incident is clearly visible. The bullet also left a mark on the cape, located on the back right side of the statue.\\r\\nEleven presidents have lain in state in the Rotunda for public viewing, most recently Gerald Ford. The tomb meant for Washington stored the catafalque which is used to support coffins lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque is now on display in the Capitol Visitors Center for the general public to see when not in use.\\r\\nThe Hall of Columns is located on the House side of the Capitol, home to twenty-eight fluted columns and statues from the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the basement of the Capitol building in a utility room are two marble bathtubs, which are all that remain of the once elaborate Senate baths. These baths were a spa-like facility designed for members of Congress and their guests before many buildings in the city had modern plumbing. The facilities included several bathtubs, a barbershop, and a massage parlor.\\r\\nA steep, metal staircase, totaling 365 steps, leads from the basement to an outdoor walkway on top of the Capitol's dome.[50] The number of steps represents each day of the year.[51] Also in the basement, the weekly Jummah prayer is held on Fridays by Muslim staffers.[52]\\r\\nContrary to a popular myth, D.C. building height laws have never referred to the height of the Capitol building, which rises to 289 feet (88?m).[53] Indeed, the Capitol is only the fifth-tallest structure in Washington.\\r\\nThe House of Representatives Chamber has 448 permanent seats. Unlike Senators, Representatives do not have assigned seats.[54] The chamber is large enough to accommodate members of all three branches of the federal government and invited guests for joint sessions of Congress such as the State of the Union speech and other events. It is adorned with relief portraits of famous lawmakers and lawgivers throughout history. Of the twenty-three relief portraits only Moses is sculpted from a full front view and is located across from the dais where the Speaker of the House ceremonially sits.\\r\\nIn order clockwise around the chamber:\\r\\nThere is also a quote etched in the marble of the chamber, as stated by venerable statesman Daniel Webster: \\"Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.\\"[56]\\r\\nFrom 1800 to 1806, this room served as the Senate Chamber and from 1806 until 1860, the room was used as the Supreme Court Chamber. In 1860, the Supreme Court began using the newly vacated Old Senate Chamber. Since 1935, the Supreme Court has met in the United States Supreme Court Building.\\r\\nThe current Senate Chamber opened in 1859[57] and is adorned with white marble busts of the former Presidents of the Senate (Vice Presidents).[58]\\r\\nThe Capitol Grounds cover approximately 274 acres (1.11?km2), with the grounds proper consisting mostly of lawns, walkways, streets, drives, and planting areas. Several monumental sculptures used to be located on the east facade and lawn of the Capitol including The Rescue and George Washington. The current grounds were designed by noted American landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who planned the expansion and landscaping performed from 1874 to 1892. In 1875, as one of his first recommendations, Olmsted proposed the construction of the marble terraces on the north, west, and south sides of the building that exist today.\\r\\nOlmsted also designed the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits just north of the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.\\r\\nUp to four U.S. flags can be seen flying over the Capitol. Two flagpoles are located at the base of the dome on the East and West sides. These flagpoles have flown the flag day and night since World War I. The other two flagpoles are above the North (Senate) and South (House of Representatives) wings of the building, and fly only when the chamber below is in session. The flag above the House of Representatives is raised and lowered by House pages. The flag above the United States Senate is raised and lowered by Senate Doorkeepers. To raise the flag, Doorkeepers access the roof of the Capitol from the Senate Sergeant at Arms's office. Several auxiliary flagpoles, to the west of the dome and not visible from the ground, are used to meet congressional requests for flags flown over the Capitol.[citation needed] Constituents pay for U.S. flags flown over the Capitol to commemorate a variety of events such as the death of a veteran family member.\\r\\nThe Capitol, as well as the grounds of Capitol Hill, have played host to major events, including presidential inaugurations held every four years. During an inauguration, the front of the Capitol is outfitted with a platform and a grand staircase. Annual events at the Capitol include Independence Day celebrations, and the National Memorial Day Concert.\\r\\nThe general public has paid respect to a number of individuals lying in state at the Capitol, including numerous former presidents, senators, and other officials. Other Americans lying in honor include Officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, the two officers killed in the 1998 shooting incident. Chestnut was the first African American ever to lie in honor in the Capitol. The public also paid respect to Rosa Parks, an icon of the Civil Rights Movement, at the Capitol in 2005. She was the first woman and second African American to lie in honor in the Capitol. On September 24, 2015, Pope Francis gave a joint address to Congress, the first Pope to do so.[59]\\r\\nOn January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the United States Capitol. When President Andrew Jackson was leaving the Capitol out of the East Portico after the funeral of South Carolina Representative Warren R. Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either burst from a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring.[60] Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.\\r\\nOn July 2, 1915, prior to the United States' entry into World War I, Eric Muenter (aka Frank Holt), a German professor who wanted to stop American support of the Allies of World War I, exploded a bomb in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. The next morning he tried to assassinate J. P. Morgan, Jr., son of the financier, at his home on Long Island, New York. In a letter to the Washington Evening Star published after the explosion, Muenter, writing under an assumed name, said he hoped that the detonation would \\"make enough noise to be heard above the voices that clamor for war.\\" J.P. Morgan's company served as Great Britain's principal U.S. purchasing agent for munitions and other war supplies.\\r\\nIn 1954, Puerto Rican nationalists opened fire on members of Congress from the visitors' gallery, injuring five representatives. On March 1, 1971, a bomb exploded on the ground floor of the Capitol, placed by the radical left domestic terrorist group, the Weather Underground. They placed the bomb as a demonstration against U.S. involvement in Laos. On November 7, 1983, a group called the Armed Resistance Unit claimed responsibility for a bomb that detonated in the lobby outside the office of Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd.[61] Six people associated with the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee were later found in contempt of court for refusing to testify about the bombing.[62] In 1990, three members of the Armed Resistance Unit were convicted of the bombing, which they claimed was in response to the invasion of Grenada.[63] On July 24, 1998, Russell Eugene Weston Jr. burst into the Capitol and opened fire, killing two Capitol Police officers. The Capitol is believed to have been the intended target of the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, before it crashed near Shanksville in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after passengers tried to take over control of the plane from hijackers.[64][65]\\r\\nSince the September 11 attacks, the roads and grounds around the Capitol have undergone dramatic changes. The United States Capitol Police have also installed checkpoints to inspect vehicles at specific locations around Capitol Hill,[66][67] and have closed a section of one street indefinitely.[67] The level of screening employed varies. On the main east-west thoroughfares of Constitution and Independence Avenues, barricades are implanted in the roads that can be raised in the event of an emergency. Trucks larger than pickups are interdicted by the Capitol Police and are instructed to use other routes. On the checkpoints at the shorter cross streets, the barriers are typically kept in a permanent \\"emergency\\" position, and only vehicles with special permits are allowed to pass. All Capitol visitors are screened by a magnetometer, and all items that visitors may bring inside the building are screened by an x-ray device. In both chambers, gas masks are located underneath the chairs in each chamber for members to use in case of emergency.[citation needed] Structures ranging from scores of Jersey barriers to hundreds of ornamental bollards have been erected to obstruct the path of any vehicles that might stray from the designated roadways.[68]\\r\\nIn 2004 the capitol was briefly evacuated after a plane carrying the then governor of Kentucky strayed into restricted airspace over the district. A shooting incident occurred in March 2016. One female bystander was wounded by police but not seriously injured; a man pointing a gun was shot and arrested, in critical but stable condition.[69] The city police of Washington D.C. described the shooting incident as \\"isolated\\".[70]\\r\\nThe United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), located below the East Front of the Capitol and its plaza, between the Capitol building and 1st Street East, opened on December 2, 2008. The CVC provides a single security checkpoint for all visitors, including those with disabilities, and an expansion space[clarification needed] for the US Congress.[71][72] The complex contains 580,000 square feet (54,000?m2) of space below ground on three floors,[73] and offers visitors a food court, restrooms, and educational exhibits, including an 11-foot scale model of the Capitol dome.[74] It also features skylights affording views of the actual dome. Long in the planning stages, construction began in the fall of 2001, following the killing of two Capitol police officers in 1998. The estimated final cost of constructing the CVC was $621 million.[75]","input":"What was the united states first national capital?"},{"output":"September 6, 2010","context":"Regular Show (also known as Regular Show in Space during its eighth season[3]) is an American animated television sitcom created by J. G. Quintel for Cartoon Network that aired between September 6, 2010 to January 16, 2017. The series revolves around the lives of two working-class friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigbyboth employed as groundskeepers at a local park. They usually try to solve a simple problem but then it leads to a surreal, extreme, and often supernatural misadventure. During these misadventures, they interact with the show's other main characters: Benson, Pops, Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost, Skips, Margaret and Eileen.[4]\\r\\nMany of Regular Show's characters were loosely based on those developed for Quintel's student films at California Institute of the Arts: The Na?ve Man from Lolliland and 2 in the AM PM.[5] The former was one of the winners of the 2005 Nicktoons Film Festival and received international attention after being broadcast on Nicktoons Network.[6] Quintel pitched Regular Show for Cartoon Network's Cartoonstitute project, in which the network allowed young artists to create pilots with no notes, which would possibly be optioned as shows. The project was green-lit and it premiered on September 6, 2010.\\r\\nAs of May 2013, the program has been watched by approximately 2 to 2.5 million viewers each week. The series has received positive reviews from critics and has developed a following of all ages. Regular Show has been nominated for several awards, including seven Annie Awards, six Primetime Emmy Awardsone of which it won for the episode \\"Eggscellent\\" (season 3, episode 18) and three British Academy Children's Awards. A film based on the series, titled Regular Show: The Movie, premiered in 2015.[7]\\r\\nAfter eight seasons and 261 episodes, the series concluded on January 16, 2017 with the one-hour finale \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\".[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series revolves around the daily lives of two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a blue jay), and Rigby (a raccoon). They work as groundskeepers at a park, and spend their days trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means.[10] This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.\\r\\nRegular Show largely grew out of creator J. G. Quintel's life and experiences in college. Quintel attended the California Institute of the Arts, and many of the characters on Regular Show are based on the characters developed for his student films The Na?ve Man from Lolliland (2005) and 2 in the AM PM (2006). Both originated as part of a game called \\"48-hour films\\", in which students put words into a hat, pulled out one word at midnight and spent a weekend developing ideas for a film. Quintel attended college with Thurop Van Orman and Pendleton Ward, who both went on to work at Cartoon Network Studios with Quintel; Van Orman created The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack and Ward created Adventure Time. Quintel concurrently worked on Camp Lazlo and as creative director on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack while completing his degree. He was later invited to pitch for Cartoon Network's Cartoonstitute, a project to showcase short films created without the interference of network executives and focus testing,[11][12]\\r\\nJ. G. Quintel returned to the characters from his films, put them together with newer characters and created a pilot.[12] Quintel wanted to present a visual pitch rather than a verbal one, believing the idea would make little sense otherwise. He storyboarded the idea for the pilot, and Craig McCracken and Rob Renzetti liked his presentation.[13] Regular Show was one of two series from the project that were green-lit (the other show being Secret Mountain Fort Awesome, based on the Cartoonstitute short Uncle Grandpa, which in turn became its own series later on). The project was eventually scrapped and never premiered on television.[14] The character of Mordecai embodies Quintel during his college years, specifically at CalArts; Quintel said, \\"That's that time when you're hanging out with your friends and getting into stupid situations, but you're also taking it seriously enough.\\"[4] The character of Rigby was randomly developed when Quintel drew a raccoon hula-hooping. He liked the design and developed the character of Rigby to be far less responsible than his companion.[15]\\r\\nThe show is inspired by some British television series and video games. Episodes are produced using storyboarding and hand-drawn animation, and each episode takes roughly nine months to create. Quintel recruited several independent comic book artists to draw the show's animated elements; their style matched closely Quintel's ideas for the series. The show's soundtrack comprises original music composed by Mark Mothersbaugh and licensed songs. While preparing for the beginning of the show, Quintel looked for young, independent, comic artists to compose the show's storyboard artists; he thought that the style would closely match that of Regular Show. He looked through blogs and convention panels for the \\"total package\\", which he said was the ability to write and draw; something that many independent comic book artists possess. In addition, Quintel attended many open shows at CalArtsan eight-hour festival of student animation.[12] The style and sensibility of Regular Show was difficult to work with in the beginning; the artists struggled to create a natural, sitcom-like sound for the series.[13]\\r\\nRegular Show was inspired by The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-Head, and Quintel credited the stylistic elements of Joe Murray's Rocko's Modern Life and Camp Lazlo as working their way into his style.[13] Video games Street Fighter, Shadowrun and ToeJam & Earl  which Quintel played when he was a child  inspired the series, as did some British television programs. Quintel's interest in British television was influenced by his British roommate at CalArts, who introduced him to The League of Gentlemen, The IT Crowd, Little Britain, The Office and The Mighty Boosh; the latter was very influential to Quintel and would later influence the humor in Regular Show.[12]\\r\\nThe process of writing a script for Regular Show begins with the staff writers playing \\"writers games\\" for inspiration to find an idea that they find enjoyable.[citation needed] Once an idea is approved, the premise of the episode is written and passed to the storyboard artists, who create the dialogue.[citation needed] The writers try to make the conversations feel natural to the audience, using examples from their own experiences. The script is then shown to the network executives, who give notes on what should be added or changed.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe plot generally begins with a basic problem that the characters must overcome. While the protagonists work on their task, a magical, supernatural, or strange element appears and complicates the initially simple problem.[citation needed] The writers decided to follow this narrative structure to take advantage of the animation.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe series is rated TV-PG-V.[citation needed] Cartoon Network told Quintel early on that they wanted to \\"age it up from the TV-Y7 stuff we'd been doing in the past\\". This direction led the crew to use adult-oriented humor with innuendos and drug and alcohol references because they wanted to cater for both the younger and adult audiences. The writers generally make these jokes subtle. The show also makes use of sub-textual adult humor through music. One of the program's storyboard artists, Calvin Wong, said that he enjoys the limitations set by writing for the show since the adult-oriented jokes that are approved are satisfying.[15]\\r\\nThe plots of the episodes are influenced by the writers' and Quintel's personal experiences, such as performing prank telephone calls or accepting an eating challenge from a restaurant. The show often references 1980s culture, using music and electronic devices from that era because many factors from the decade left a positive influence on Quintel.[citation needed] The show also makes references to modern social trends such as viral internet videos.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe voice acting of the series is relatively low-key, and the intention was to make most of the characters sound natural and conversational.[4] Quintel wanted to make the show listenable and given contrast to most other cartoons, which often are difficult for adults to listen to. The main cast consists of voice acting veterans Mark Hamill, who portrays Skips and Roger Craig Smith, who plays Thomas. William Salyers plays the voice of Rigby, Janie Haddad portrays Margaret and Quintel's former CalArts classmate Sam Marin voices Benson, Pops, and Muscle Man.[4] Quintel portrays Mordecai and Hi-Five Ghost.[4] Members of the production staff have voiced several characters throughout the series; these include Minty Lewis, Toby Jones, Andress Salaff, and Matt Price. The Regular Show cast record their lines together in group as opposed to individual recording sessions for each actor; this is to help the show's dialogue sound natural. The series regularly uses guest voice actors for recurring characters; these guests include Steven Blum, Courtenay Taylor, David Ogden Stiers, Robin Atkin Downes, Jeff Bennett, Jennifer Hale, David Kaye, Fred Tatasciore and Julian Holloway.\\r\\nEach episode of Regular Show takes about nine months to complete. Quintel and his 35-member team develop each episode at Cartoon Network Studios in Burbank, California.[16][17] The script is illustrated in rough hand-drawn images, known as storyboards.[18] The storyboards are then animated and mixed with the corresponding dialogue to create the animatic, which is then sent to be approved by the network. The show's assets (backgrounds, character designs, props) are then assembled to be sent to Saerom Animation in South Korea, where the actual animation production of the episode is performed. When finished, the episode is sent to Sabre Media Studios back in California. Music and sound effects are created and the final episode is mixed and completed. The process allows the production team to work concurrently on dozens of episodes at different stages of production.\\r\\nAlthough most modern animation has switched to hybrid methods such as the Cintiq, Regular Show has been described as \\"far more low-fi\\", and is animated traditionally by hand using paper which is then digitally composited and painted with digital ink and paint. Although Cintiqs were initially optioned to be used for the program, Quintel has stated that he has felt more comfortable working on paper, considering it to be more organic and more representative of each artist's individual style. Board artist Calvin Wong said, \\"the tools of the trade as being pencils, pens, white out and occasionally light boxes and electric erasers\\".[12]\\r\\nRegular Show has no regular theme music; instead at the beginning of each episode, a blurred sound (provided by Quintel) followed by a ticking a clock is heard over the title cards.[citation needed] The main composer of the series is Mark Mothersbaugh, one of the founding members of the band Devo. As Quintel was developing the pilot he considered asking Mothersbaugh to create the music for the show. The episode's animatic was sent to Mothersbaugh along with a request for him to join the show's staff and crew.\\r\\nRegular Show will occasionally make use of licensed songsmostly from the 1980s; this began when Quintel and the staff writers started recording the animatics using copyrighted songs for the montage scenes. The network executives watched the animatic and asked the crew if they wanted to use some of the songs for the finished episodes.[4] Quintel said that the songs are chosen for their suitability for the scene, whether they sound good and are affordable. Quintel enjoys using the songs in the episodes because adult viewers might remember them and younger viewers might appreciate older music.[4] Songs have included \\"You're the Best Around\\", \\"Mississippi Queen\\" and \\"A Holly Jolly Christmas\\".[4]\\r\\nThe show also produces original songs which are used on the episodes. These are generally composed by Mothersbaugh and written by one of the staff's storyboard artists.[4] \\"Summertime Loving, Loving in the Summer (Time)\\" was written by the staff member Sean Szeles and appeared in the episode \\"This Is My Jam\\" (season 2, episode 13).[4]\\r\\nMost episodes of Regular Show last 11 minutes; episodes are usually paired together to fill a half-hour program slot. 261 episodes in eight seasons have been completed and broadcast. The first season began on September 6, 2010, with the episode \\"The Power\\" and ended on November 22, 2010, with \\"Mordecai and the Rigbys\\".[19] The second season began on November 29, 2010, with \\"Ello Gov'nor\\" and ended on August 1, 2011, with \\"Karaoke Video\\".[20] The third season premiered on September 19, 2011, with the episode \\"Stick Hockey\\" and concluded on September 3, 2012, with \\"Bad Kiss\\".[21] The fourth season premiered on October 1, 2012, with the half-hour special \\"Exit 9B\\" and concluded on August 12, 2013 with \\"Steak Me Amadeus\\".[22] The fifth season premiered on September 2, 2013, with the episodes \\"Laundry Woes\\" and \\"Silver Dude\\" and concluded on August 14, 2014, with \\"Real Date\\".[23][24] The sixth season premiered on October 9, 2014, with \\"Maxin' and Relaxin'\\",[25] and ended on June 25, 2015 with \\"Dumped at the Altar\\".[26] The seventh season premiered with \\"Dumptown U.S.A.\\" on June 26, 2015[27] and ended with the half-hour \\"Rigby's Graduation Day Special\\" on June 30, 2016. The eighth and final season, titled Regular Show in Space, started on September 26, 2016 with \\"One Space Day at a Time\\" and ended on January 16, 2017 with \\"A Regular Epic Final Battle\\".[28]\\r\\nMordecai and Rigby had cameo appearances on the Uncle Grandpa episode \\"Pizza Eve\\", along with other Cartoon Network characters from currently running and ended cartoons.[29]\\r\\nMordecai, Rigby and High Five Ghost, make a small cameo in The Amazing World of Gumball episode \\"The Boredom\\", along with the titular characters from Uncle Grandpa and Clarence.[30]\\r\\nRegular Show became an instant hit. Its first and second seasons, broadcast on Monday nights, ranked number one in its time slot among all key boy demos across all of television according to Nielsen Media Research.[31] The pilot's premiere was watched by 2.097 million viewers.[32] For the following episodes of the first season, viewership increased by over 10 percent from the time period of the previous year. For instance, the entry was viewed by 1.339 million children aged 2ÿ11, a 65 percent increase from the previous year. It was also watched by 716,000 children aged 9ÿ14; a 43 percent increase. The second season premiere, \\"Ello Gov'nor\\", marked a decline from the first season premiere's figures. It gained 2.067 million views, but it marked an increase from the first season finale, which was watched by 2.028 million viewers.[33][34] The third season premiere, \\"Stick Hockey\\", saw a bigger decline in viewers, recording 2 million views.[35] As the series continued its ratings grew; the fourth season premiere, \\"Exit 9B\\", was watched by 3.047 million viewersa significant increase from previous seasons.[36]\\r\\nRegular Show received critical acclaim from critics. A reviewer from IGN, R.L. Shaffer, called the show zany, absurd, bizarre, and hilarious. He praised the show's writing, and said that it included \\"snappy dialogue, odd characters, and clever storieseach more irrelevant than the lastRegular Show never ceases to tickle the funny bone\\".[38] He finished his review by calling the show \\"a pretty awesome piece of refreshing off-the-wall comedy\\" and wrote that it's \\"humorously animated, brazenly silly and almost always funny\\".[38]\\r\\nDVD Talk's Neil Lumbrad described the show as \\"offbeat sense of humor with a lot of randomness that makes its title both peculiar and hilarious\\" and compared it to the original Looney Tunes shorts and other cartoonsincluding The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory, and Johnny Bravowhich Cartoon Network has produced. He wrote that the network has found \\"animated gold with Regular Show, which is too offbeat and unique to be called regular\\" and that it is a \\"comedic animated gem worthy of being discovered for years to come\\".[39] Lumbrad ended his review by recommending the show and calling it \\"one truly awesome cartoon with a lot of good humor to enjoy.\\"[39]\\r\\nThe A.V. Club's critic, Alasdair Wilkins, said that compared to Cartoon Network's other animated comedy, Adventure Time, he does not consider the series to be funny, and describing it as \\"more pleasingly weird\\".[40] He said that the episodes' plots can occasionally be too complex to explore completely in the show's 11 minutes, and also said that the usual story setup can make some stories feel structurally the same as others.[41] Wilkins said that he considers that the show is at its best when it focuses on the jokes, the character moments and inventive ways to use animation. Kevin McFarland, also of The A.V. Club, said that he considers the series a thrill to watch; he complemented the animation style, the characters, and the use of motifs.[37]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Boom!

Jersey Shore premiered on December 3, 2009, with back-to-back episodes, averaging 1.375 million viewers.[55] Although the initial ratings were considered unimpressive to Salsano, they slowly grew in popularity, and was the subject of parody on Saturday Night Live after the third week, a turnaround that MTV executive Tony DiSanto calls \\"the fastest 0 to 60 I've ever seen on a show\\".[30] Season 1 posted strong growth every week and ranked #1 in its time period versus all cable competition among P12ÿ34 (people 12 to 34 years old) during the first quarter of 2010, with a season high 2.6 rating for the finale.[56] The season 1 finale audience, 4.8 million, was more than triple that of the premiere, an increase of more than 3.4 million, and was MTVs highest rated original series telecast in almost two years.[56] Overall, the season 1 averaged 2.7 million viewers.[57]\\r\\nIn an article in Rolling Stone, it was mentioned that the house had 35 remote-controlled cameras in fixed locations, 12 hand-held ones, one IMX camera and six DV cameras.[58] Nicole Polizzi said that:\\r\\nThey have cameras everywhere, all the time... You're always being watched. You kind of get a little paranoid, because you're like, 'Who's watching me?'... It's trippy. it messes with your head. But that's why we go crazy. That's why we fight with each other. That's why we drink. We're living in a house for two months with that shit. We can't have cellphones, TV, radio or internet... There's no normalcy. It's like a prison, with cameras. The only time we're not on camera is when we're in the shower, and that's why we all take three-hour showers, just to get away from it all.[58]\\r\\nAfter Season 1, the cast negotiated pay raises, though both they and DiSanto explained that it was not contentious, and was given undue weight by the press. Rather than wait until the next New Jersey summer for Season 2, the production moved to Miami.[30]\\r\\nIn January 2010, MTV announced that a second season consisting of 12 episodes had been ordered and would air that summer.[59][60][61] It would follow all of the first-season cast as they avoided the cold northeast winter[59][60] by relocating to the South Beach, Florida. In May 2010 the cast relocated back to the Jersey Shore for the rest of filming, but it was later determined that the production company had enough footage from the Miami shoot to fill the entire second season,[62] and that the footage to be shot at the Jersey Shore would be used for a third season.[63] The second season premiered on July 29, 2010,[63] averaging 5.252 million viewers.[64] Season 2 was the #1 television series in the P12-34 demographic for the summer of 2010 across all TV and has also posted continued growth every week.[65]\\r\\nOn July 20, 2010, MTV announced that the cast would return for a third season,[13][66][67] with the exception of Pivarnick.[68] Season 3 returned to the original Jersey Shore summer setting,[13][66] and replaced Angelina with Deena Nicole Cortese, a longtime friend of Polizzi.[69] The season's January 6, 2011 premiere was viewed by a record 8.45 million viewers, making it MTV's most viewed series telecast ever.[70][71] The second episode of the season once again set a series and MTV high at the time, with 8.56 million viewers,[72] only to set another record with the airing of the fourth episode, which garnered 8.87 million viewers.[73]\\r\\nOn January 25, 2011, it was confirmed that the show had been renewed for a fourth season, to be filmed in Italy during the first half of 2011.[2][3] The fourth season premiered August 4, 2011.[3] MTV confirmed in June 2011 that the fifth season would return to Seaside Heights.[74]\\r\\nBelieved complications caused by Nicole Polizzi's pregnancy, and several cast members (including Polizzi, DelVecchio, and Farley) receiving spin-offs sparked talk about the future of the series past the fifth season, however on March 19, 2012, MTV officially confirmed that the series would return for a sixth season, with all cast members returning. Filming for the sixth season took place in mid-2012, and featured Polizzi nearly eight months pregnant. MTV said in a statement, \\"While things will definitely be a little different this time when they hit the boardwalk, their trademark hilarity and family dysfunction will remain the same\\".[75]\\r\\nThe Jersey Shore house is the name given to the house used on MTV show Jersey Shore. Located in Seaside Heights, the house was used during the first season, starting on December 3, 2009, and was used on the show in four out of the six seasons. Since the show's cancellation, the house is currently being rented out for days at a time.[76]\\r\\nThe house was characterized by its unique decor and the hot tub. During the filming of Jersey Shore, the house was decorated with Scarface posters and Cadillac symbols and wheels. The house is also home to the duck phone, a home telephone in the form of a mallard duck.[77] All of the furniture that is seen on the show was brought in by MTV, including the hot tub, for which they needed a permit from Seaside Heights when filming.[78]\\r\\nWhen filming season three onward, the home was equipped with 35 remote-controlled cameras in fixed locations throughout the home and the camera crew consisted of twelve handheld cameras, one IMX Camera, and six DV Cameras.[79]\\r\\nOn February 23, 2010, Amazon.com and MTV teamed up to release Jersey Shore on DVD.[80] The title theme, \\"Get Crazy\\" by LMFAO has been changed.[citation needed] Other songs have been changed since their original air date as well.[citation needed] A retail release by Paramount Home Entertainment with added commentary was released on July 20.[81] Although it is claimed the DVDs are uncensored, the video and some audio is still censored.[82] The DVD also includes special features include deleted scenes, the reunion special, \\"Tips From The Situation and Snooki\\", \\"Before the Shore\\", and the \\"Jersey Shore Makeover with Michael Cera\\", amongst others.[83] On December 28, 2010 the Season 2 Uncensored DVD was released. On July 26, 2011 the Season 3 Uncensored DVD was released. On December 27, 2011 the Season 4 Uncensored DVD was released. On August 28, 2012 the Season 5 Uncensored DVD was released.\\r\\nA soundtrack to the series was released as Jersey Shore Soundtrack by MTV and Universal Republic on July 20, 2010.[84][85] Aimed to create the perfect summer playlist, the album features songs from a variety of artists including Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull, Taio Cruz, Ludacris, Lil Jon, 3OH!3, David Guetta, Fergie, Chris Willis, Girlicious and LMFAO as well as DJs like Deadmau5, Steve Aoki, Ti?sto, Diplo, Paul Oakenfold and Delvecchio.[85] A deluxe edition of the album was also released containing a bonus CD featuring songs inspired from the first season of the show, like LMFAO's \\"Get Crazy\\".[84] The first single off the album was Enrique Iglesias' \\"I Like It\\",[84] whose video also featured the Jersey Shore cast.[86] In September 2010, Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked Delvecchio's rap song off the soundtrack, \\"(It's Time to) Beat Dat Beat\\", as the #1 Worst Song Ever on the list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever; as a bonus, Wilkening used Delvecchio's quote as the reason for the #1 list: \\"Being a guido's a way of life. I don't represent all Italians, I represent myself. I started this whole GTL shit (Gym, Tan, Laundry). You have to stay fresh to death.\\"[87]\\r\\nA quote book titled Gym, Tanning, Laundry: The Official Jersey Shore Quote Book (ISBN?978-1-4391-9682-3) was released by MTV on June 15, 2010.[88] The book also includes a bonus DVD with the most memorable moments from season one of the show.[89] A sticker book titled Jersey Shore Sticker Activity Book (ISBN?0-7666-3904-5) was also released on the same date,[90] as well as a 2011 wall calendar (ISBN?0-7407-9797-2) by Andrews McMeel Publishing.[91]\\r\\nOther merchandise relating to the show have also been released, including talking bobblehead dolls of the cast,[92] a beach game set,[93] Halloween costumes,[94] a \\"Gym Tanning Laundry (GTL)\\" labeled sports bottle,[95] \\"The Situation - Official App\\" for iPhone,[96] as well as various T-shirts.[97]\\r\\nThe cast of Jersey Shore appeared on the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[98] Nicole Polizzi appeared on TLC's Cake Boss episode \\"Snookie, Super Anthony & a Ship\\" on November 8, 2010, in which she orders a cake for her mom. Polizzi also appeared on the March 14, 2011 edition of WWE Raw as the guest host and she wrestled a professional wrestling match on April 4, 2011 at WrestleMania XXVII.[99] Jennifer Farley and Angelina Pivarnick appeared on various episodes of TNA Impact in 2011.[100][101] The cast of Jersey Shore appears on MTV's Season 4 of Disaster Date, starring Jen Lilley, Lauren Zima, Cale Hartmann, Jason Karasev, Russell Pitts, Hasan Minhaj, Diarra Kilpatrick, and Kara Luiz.[102] Angelina Pivarnick appeared in the show NY Ink in which she got a tattoo that shows her time in Jersey Shore.\\r\\nIn 2010, MTV received criticism from Italian American organizations for the way in which they marketed the show, as it liberally used the word Guido to describe the cast members.[103] The term \\"guido\\" is generally regarded as an ethnic slur when referring to Italians and Italian Americans. One promotion stated that the show was to follow, \\"eight of the hottest, tannest, craziest Guidos\\",[104] while yet another advertisement stated, \\"[the show] exposes one of the tri-state area's most misunderstood species?... the GUIDO. Yes, they really do exist! Our Guidos and Guidettes will move into the ultimate beach house rental and indulge in everything the Seaside Heights, New Jersey scene has to offer.\\"[105]\\r\\nCast members Snooki and JWoww are not ethnically Italian. Snooki is Chilean, but was adopted as an infant by Italian American parents. Jwoww is of Irish and Spanish descent.[106] Ronnie, Sammi, and Angelina are only of partial Italian descent: Ronnie is part Puerto Rican, Sammi is part Greek, and Angelina is part Polish.[citation needed]\\r\\nPrior to the series debut, UNICO National formally requested that MTV cancel the show.[107] In a letter to the network, UNICO called the show a \\"...?direct, deliberate and disgraceful attack on Italian Americans?...\\"[108] UNICO National President Andre DiMino said in a statement \\"MTV has festooned the 'bordello-like' house set with Italian flags and green, white and red maps of New Jersey while every other cutaway shot is of Italian signs and symbols. They are blatantly as well as subliminally bashing Italian-Americans with every technique possible?...\\"[109] Around this time, other Italian-American organizations joined the fight, including the National Italian American Foundation,[110] the Order Sons of Italy in America and the internet watch-dog ItalianAware.[111][112]\\r\\nMTV responded to the controversy by issuing a press release which stated in part, \\"the Italian-American cast takes pride in their ethnicity. We understand that this show is not intended for every audience and depicts just one aspect of youth culture.\\"[103] Since the calls for the show's removal, several sponsors have requested that their ads not be aired during the show. These sponsors include Dell, Domino's and American Family Insurance.[113]\\r\\nIn a February 2010 interview, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie called the show \\"negative for New Jersey\\" because most of the cast members are not from the state. According to Christie, the program \\"takes a bunch of New Yorkers and drops them at the Jersey Shore and tries to make America feel like this is the real New Jersey\\". Governor Christie took action against the series by trying to encourage people to experience the real Jersey Shore for themselves rather than watch it through MTV: \\"I can tell people: They want to know what New Jersey really is? I welcome them to come to New Jersey any time.\\"[114] A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll released in February 2010 showed that 59% of Americans who had seen the show had a favorable view of New Jersey compared to only 44% of those that had not seen the show.[115] The FDU poll repeated the national telephone survey in 2011 and showed similar results.[116] Consequently, poll director Peter Woolley concluded that These measures... suggest the show isnt hurting the nations view of the state. In fact, it may be promoting one of the states best features--not Snooki, but the shore itself.\\"[117]\\r\\nNonetheless, in September 2011, Governor Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax incentive awarded to the show by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, stating: \\"As chief executive, I am duty-bound to ensure that taxpayers are not footing a $420,000 bill for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\\"[118]\\r\\nOn April 7, 2011, MTV announced it had picked up two spin-off shows featuring cast members Nicole, Jenny and Pauly, picking up twelve episodes of each show. One show focuses on Nicole and Jenny living together in their own apartment and is titled Snooki & JWoww.[128][129] The other show follows Pauly jet-setting around the country for various DJ gigs and is titled The Pauly D Project. Filming for both shows started at the end of 2011 and premiered in 2012. SallyAnn Salsano of 495 Productions (Jersey Shore) is the executive producer of both spin-offs.[128] The Pauly D Project was cancelled after one season.\\r\\nEight official similar iterations have been made, including two in the United Kingdom, one in Spain, one in Russia, one in Poland, and one in Mexico. An international crossover, MTV Super Shore, was co-produced by MTV South Europe and MTV Latin America.[130]\\r\\nOther somewhat similar shows to Jersey Shore that have been planned or aired, include:","input":"When did the first episode of jersey shore air?"},{"output":"pound sterling","context":"3p, 4p, 6p,[1] 25p, S5, Sovereign (British coin),\\r\\n?United Kingdom\\r\\n?Guernsey (local issue: Guernsey pound)\\r\\n?Isle of Man (local issue: Manx pound)\\r\\nThe pound sterling (symbol: S; ISO code: GBP), commonly known as the pound and less commonly referred to as Sterling, is the official currency of the United Kingdom, Jersey, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,[8][9] and Tristan da Cunha.[10] It is subdivided into 100 pence (singular: penny, abbreviated: p). A number of nations that do not use sterling also have currencies called the pound. At various times, the pound sterling was commodity money or bank notes backed by silver or gold, but it is currently fiat money, backed only by the economy in the areas where it is accepted. The pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use and which has been in continuous use since its inception.[11]\\r\\nSterling is the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market, after the United States dollar, the euro, and the Japanese yen.[12] Together with those three currencies it forms the basket of currencies which calculate the value of IMF special drawing rights, with an 11.3% weighting as of 2011[update] (USD 41.9%, Euro 37.4%, Yen 9.4%).[needs update] Sterling is also the third most-held reserve currency in global reserves (about 4%).[13]\\r\\nThe British Crown dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man produce their own local issues of sterling: the \\"Guernsey pound\\", the \\"Jersey pound\\" and the Manx pound),[14] Gibraltar (alongside the Gibraltar pound), the Falkland Islands (alongside the Falkland Islands pound), Saint Helena and Ascension Island in Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (alongside the Saint Helena pound). The Bank of England is the central bank for the pound sterling, issuing its own coins and banknotes, and regulating issuance of banknotes by private banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Banknotes issued by other jurisdictions are not regulated by the Bank of England; local governments use Bank of England notes as backing for local issuance by allowing them to be exchanged 1:1 at face value.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full official name pound sterling (plural: pounds sterling), is used mainly in formal contexts and also when it is necessary to distinguish the United Kingdom currency from other currencies with the same name. Otherwise the term pound is normally used. The currency name is sometimes abbreviated to just sterling, particularly in the wholesale financial markets, but not when referring to specific amounts; for example, \\"Payment is accepted in sterling\\" but never \\"These cost five sterling\\". The abbreviations \\"ster.\\" and \\"stg.\\" are sometimes used. The term \\"British pound\\" is sometimes incorrectly used in less formal contexts, and it is not an official name of the currency.\\r\\nThe exchange rate of the pound sterling against the US Dollar is referred to as \\"cable\\" in the wholesale foreign exchange markets. The origins of this term are attributed to the fact that in the 1800s, the GBP/USD exchange rate was transmitted via transatlantic cable. Forex traders of GBP/USD are sometimes referred to as \\"cable dealers\\".[15] GBP/USD is now the only currency pair with its own name in the foreign exchange markets, after IEP/USD, known as \\"wire\\" particularly in the forward FX markets, no longer exists after the Irish Pound was replaced by the euro in 1999.\\r\\nThere is apparent convergence of opinion[citation needed] regarding the origin of the term \\"pound sterling\\", toward its derivation from the name of a small Norman silver coin,[16] and away from its association with Easterlings (Germanic traders) or other etymologies.[17][18] Hence, the Oxford English Dictionary (and sources derived therefrom)[19][20] state that the \\"most plausible\\" etymology is derivation from the Old English steorra for \\"star\\" with the added diminutive suffix \\"-ling\\", to mean \\"little star\\" and to refer to a silver penny of the English Normans.[16] As another established source notes,[21] the compound expression was then derived:\\r\\nsilver coins known as \\"sterlings\\" were issued in the Saxon kingdoms, 240 of them being minted from a pound of silver... Hence, large payments came to be reckoned in \\"pounds of sterlings,\\" a phrase later shortened...\\r\\nHowever, the perceived narrow window of the issuance of this coin, and the fact that coin designs changed frequently in the period in question, led Philip Grierson to reject this in favour of a more complex theory.[22]\\r\\nAnother argument that the Hanseatic League was the origin for both the origin of its definition and manufacture, and in its name is that the German name for the Baltic is \\"Ost See\\", or \\"East Sea\\", and from this the Baltic merchants were called \\"Osterlings\\", or \\"Easterlings\\". In 1260, Henry III granted them a charter of protection and land for their Kontor, the Steelyard of London, which by the 1340s was also called \\"Easterlings Hall\\", or Esterlingeshalle.[23] Because the League's money was not frequently debased like that of England, English traders stipulated to be paid in pounds of the \\"Easterlings\\", which was contracted to \\"'sterling\\".[24]\\r\\nFor further discussion of the etymology of \\"sterling\\", see sterling silver.\\r\\nThe currency sign for the pound is S, which is usually written with a single cross-bar (as on sterling bank notes), though a version with a double cross-bar (?) is also sometimes seen. This symbol derives from medieval Latin documents; the Roman words libra, solidus, and denarius (Ssd) referred to pounds, shillings and pence[21] in the British pre-decimal (duodecimal) currency system and the black-letter \\"L\\" was the abbreviation for libra, the basic Roman unit of weight.\\r\\nThe ISO 4217 currency code is GBP, formed from \\"GB\\", the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code for the United Kingdom, and the first letter of \\"pound\\". It does not stand for \\"Great Britain Pound\\" or \\"Great British Pound\\". Occasionally, the abbreviation \\"UKP\\" is used but this is non-standard because the ISO 3166 country code for the United Kingdom is GB (see Terminology of the British Isles). The Crown dependencies use their own (non-ISO) codes: GGP (Guernsey pound), JEP (Jersey pound) and IMP (Isle of Man pound). Stocks are often traded in pence, so traders may refer to pence sterling, GBX (sometimes GBp), when listing stock prices.\\r\\nA common slang term for the pound sterling or pound is quid, which is singular and plural, except in the common phrase \\"Quids in!\\" The term may have come via Italian immigrants from \\"scudo\\", the name for a number of coins used in Italy until the 19th century; or from Latin 'quid' via the common phrase quid pro quo, literally, \\"what for what,\\" or, figuratively, \\"An equal exchange or substitution\\".[25]\\r\\nSince decimalisation in 1971 (see Decimal Day), the pound has been divided into 100 pence (until 1981 described on the coinage as \\"new pence\\"). The symbol for the penny is \\"p\\"; hence an amount such as 50p (S0.50) properly pronounced \\"fifty pence\\" is more colloquially, quite often, pronounced \\"fifty pee\\" /f?fti: pi:/. This also helped to distinguish between new and old pence amounts during the changeover to the decimal system. A decimal halfpenny was issued until 1984, but was removed due to having a higher cost to manufacture than its face value.[26]\\r\\nBefore decimalisation, the pound was divided into 20 shillings and each shilling into 12 pence, making 240 pence to the pound. The symbol for the shilling was \\"s.\\"not from the first letter of the word, but from the Latin solidus. The symbol for the penny was \\"d.\\", from the French denier, from the Latin denarius (the solidus and denarius were Roman coins). A mixed sum of shillings and pence, such as 3 shillings and 6 pence, was written as \\"3/6\\" or \\"3s. 6d.\\" and spoken as \\"three and six\\" or \\"three and sixpence\\" except for \\"1/1,\\" \\"2/1\\" etc., which were spoken as \\"one and a penny\\", \\"two and a penny\\", etc.). 5 shillings, for example, was written as \\"5s.\\" or, more commonly, \\"5/ÿ\\". Various coin denominations had, and in some cases continue to have, special namessuch as crown, farthing, sovereign and guinea. See Coins of the pound sterling and List of British coins and banknotes for details.\\r\\nBy the 1950s, coins of Kings George III, George IV and William IV had disappeared from circulation, but coins (at least the penny) bearing the head of any British king or queen from Queen Victoria onwards could be found in circulation. Silver coins were replaced by those in cupro-nickel in 1947, and by the 1960s the silver coins were rarely seen. Silver/cupro-nickel shillings (from any period after 1816) and florins (2 shillings) remained as legal tender after decimalisation (as 5p and 10p respectively) until 1993, but are now officially demonetised.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pound sterling is the world's oldest currency still in use.[11]\\r\\nThe pound was a unit of account in Anglo-Saxon England, equal to 240 silver pennies and equivalent to one pound weight of silver. It evolved into the modern British currency, the pound sterling.\\r\\nThe accounting system of 4 farthings = 1 penny, 12 pence = 1 shilling, 20 shillings = 1 pound was adopted from that introduced by Charlemagne to the Frankish Empire (see French livre).\\r\\nThe origins of sterling lie in the reign of King Offa of Mercia (757ÿ796), who introduced the silver penny. It copied the denarius of the new currency system of Charlemagne's Frankish Empire. As in the Carolingian system, 240 pennies weighed 1 pound (corresponding to Charlemagne's libra), with the shilling corresponding to Charlemagne's solidus and equal to 12d. At the time of the penny's introduction, it weighed 22.5 troy grains of fine silver (32 tower grains; about 1.5 g), indicating that the Mercian pound weighed 5,400 troy grains (the Mercian pound became the basis of the tower pound, which also weighed 5,400 troy grains, equivalent to 7,680 tower grains, about 350g).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe early pennies were struck from fine silver (as pure as was available). However, in 1158, a new coinage was introduced by King Henry II (known as the Tealby penny) which was struck from 0.925 (92.5%) silver. This became the standard until the 20th century and is today known as sterling silver, named after its association with the currency.[citation needed] Sterling silver is harder than the 0.999 (99.9%) fine silver that was traditionally used, and so sterling silver coins did not wear down as rapidly as fine silver coins. The English currency was almost exclusively silver until 1344, when the gold noble was successfully introduced into circulation. However, silver remained the legal basis for sterling until 1816.\\r\\nDuring the time of Henry III, the pound sterling equalled the tower (weight) pound.[27] In the 28th year of Edward I (around 1300), the tale (money) pound, or pound sterling, first began to differ from (weigh less than) the tower pound, from which it originated, for by indenture[clarification needed] of that year the pound weight was to contain 20s. 3d. in tale pound.[27]:14 In the 27th year of Edward III (around 1354), the pound sterling was now only 80% of the pound weight, or 9 oz 12 dwt (or 9.6 oz) tower.[27]:15 By an Act of 13 Henry IV[which?] (around 1412), the pound weight of standard silver was to contain thirty shillings in tale, or one and a half pounds sterling; thus the pound sterling reduced to two-thirds of a pound weight, or 8 oz tower.[27]:18 The pound sterling was adjusted in weight several more times thereafter.\\r\\nIn the reign of Henry IV (1399ÿ1413), the penny was reduced in weight to 15 grains (0.97?g) of silver, with a further reduction to 12 grains (0.78?g) in 1464.\\r\\nDuring the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, the silver coinage was drastically debased, although the pound was redefined to the troy pound of 5,760 grains (373?g) in 1526. In 1544, a silver coinage was issued containing just one-third silver and two-thirds copperequating to .333 silver, or 33.3% pure. The result was a coin copper in appearance but relatively pale in colour. In 1552, a new silver coinage was introduced, struck in sterling silver. However, the penny's weight was reduced to 8 grains (0.52?g), so 1 troy pound of sterling silver produced 60 shillings of coins. This silver standard was known as the \\"60-shilling standard\\" and lasted until 1601 when a \\"62-shilling standard\\" was introduced, reducing the penny's weight to ?7?23?31 grains (0.50?g).\\r\\nThroughout this period, the size and value of the gold coinage fluctuated considerably.\\r\\nIn 1663, a new gold coinage was introduced based on the 22 carat fine guinea. Fixed in weight at ?44?1?2 to the troy pound from 1670, this coin's value varied considerably until 1717, when it was fixed at 21 shillings (21/-, 1.05 pounds).[28] However, despite the efforts of Sir Isaac Newton, Master of the Mint, to reduce the guinea's value, this valuation overvalued gold relative to silver when compared to the valuations in other European countries. In line with Gresham's Law, British merchants sent silver abroad in payments whilst goods for export were paid for with gold. As a consequence of these flows of silver out and gold in, Great Britain was effectively on a gold standard. Trade with China aggravated this outflow, as the Chinese refused to accept anything but silver in payment for exports. From the mid-17th century, around 28,000 metric tons (27,600 imperial tons) of silver were received by China, principally from European powers, in exchange for Chinese tea and other goods. In order to trade with China, Great Britain had first to trade with the other European nations to receive silver, which led to the East India Company redressing this trade imbalance through the indirect sale of opium to the Chinese.[29]\\r\\nDomestic offtake further reduced silver in circulation, as the improving fortunes of the merchant class led to increased demand for tablewares. Silversmiths had always regarded coinage as a source of raw material, already verified for fineness by the government. As a result, sterling coins were being melted and fashioned into sterling silverware at an accelerating rate. A 1697 Act of Parliament tried to stem this tide by raising the minimum acceptable fineness on wrought plate from sterling's 92.5% to a new Britannia silver standard of 95.83%. Silverware made purely from melted coins would be found wanting when the silversmith took his wares to the Assay Office, thus discouraging the melting of coins.\\r\\nThe Bank of England was founded in 1694, followed by the Bank of Scotland a year later. Both began to issue paper money.\\r\\nThe pound Scots once had much the same value as the pound sterling, but it suffered far higher devaluation until in the 17th century it was pegged to sterling at a value of 12 pounds Scots = 1 pound sterling.\\r\\nIn 1707, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland merged to form the Kingdom of Great Britain. In accordance with the Treaty of Union, the currency of Great Britain was sterling, with the pound Scots soon being replaced by sterling at the pegged value.\\r\\nIn 1801, Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland were united to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. However, the Irish pound continued to exist and was not replaced by sterling until January 1826. The conversion rate had long been thirteen Irish pounds to twelve pounds sterling.\\r\\nSterling circulated in much of the British Empire. In some parts, it was used alongside local currencies. For example, the gold sovereign was legal tender in Canada despite the use of the Canadian dollar. Several colonies and dominions adopted the pound as their own currency. These included Australia, Barbados,[30] British West Africa, Cyprus, Fiji, British India, the Irish Free State, Jamaica, New Zealand, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Some of these retained parity with sterling throughout their existence (e.g. the South African pound), whilst others deviated from parity after the end of the gold standard (e.g. the Australian pound). These currencies and others tied to sterling constituted the sterling area.\\r\\nThe original English colonies on mainland North America were not party to the sterling area because the above-mentioned silver shortage in England coincided with these colonies' formative years. As a result of equitable trade (and rather less equitable piracy), the Spanish milled dollar became the most common coin within the English colonies.\\r\\nDuring the American war of independence and the Napoleonic wars, Bank of England notes were legal tender, and their value floated relative to gold. The Bank also issued silver tokens to alleviate the shortage of silver coins. In 1816, the gold standard was adopted officially, with the silver standard reduced to 66 shillings (66/-, S3 6s)[clarification needed], rendering silver coins a \\"token\\" issue (i.e. not containing their value in precious metal). In 1817, the sovereign was introduced, valued at 20 shillings. Struck in 22?carat gold, it contained 113 grains (7.3?g) of gold and replaced the guinea as the standard British gold coin without changing the gold standard. In 1825, the Irish pound, which had been pegged to sterling since 1801 at a rate of 13 Irish pounds = 12 pounds sterling, was replaced, at the same rate, with sterling.\\r\\nBy the 19th century the pound sterling was widely accepted outside Britain. The American Nellie Bly carried Bank of England notes on her 1889ÿ1890 trip around the world in 72 days.[31] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many other countries adopted the gold standard. As a consequence, conversion rates between different currencies could be determined simply from the respective gold standards. The pound sterling was equal to 4.85 United States dollars, 5.25 Canadian dollars, 12.10 Dutch guilders, 26.28 French francs (or equivalent currencies in the Latin Monetary Union), 20.43 German marks or 24.02 Austro-Hungarian krone. After the International Monetary Conference of 1867 in Paris, the possibility of the UK joining the Latin Monetary Union was discussed, and a Royal Commission on International Coinage examined the issues,[32] resulting in a decision against joining monetary union.\\r\\nThe gold standard was suspended at the outbreak of the war in 1914, with Bank of England and Treasury notes becoming legal tender. Before World War I, the United Kingdom had one of the world's strongest economies, holding 40% of the world's overseas investments. But after the end of the war, the country was indebted: Britain owed S850 million (S37.3?billion as of 2015)[33] with interest costing the country some 40% of all government spending.[34] To try to resume stability, a version of the gold standard was reintroduced in 1925, under which the currency was fixed to gold at its pre-war peg, but one could only exchange currency for gold bullion, not for coins. This was abandoned on 21 September 1931, during the Great Depression, and sterling suffered an initial devaluation of some 25%.[35]\\r\\nIn 1940, an agreement with the US pegged the pound to the U.S. dollar at a rate of S1 = $4.03. (Only the year before, it had been $4.86.)[36] This rate was maintained through the Second World War and became part of the Bretton Woods system which governed post-war exchange rates. Under continuing economic pressure, and despite months of denials that it would do so, on 19 September 1949 the government devalued the pound by 30.5% to $2.80.[37] The move prompted several other currencies to be devalued against the dollar.\\r\\nOperation Bernhard was the codename of a secret Nazi plan devised during the Second World War by the RSHA and the SS to destabilise the British economy via economic warfare by flooding the global economy and the British Empire with forged Bank of England S5, S10, S20, and S50 notes.\\r\\nIn 1961, 1964, and 1966, the pound came under renewed pressure, as speculators were selling pounds for dollars. In summer 1966, with the value of the pound falling in the currency markets, exchange controls were tightened by the Wilson government. Among the measures, tourists were banned from taking more than S50 out of the country in travellers' cheques and remittances, plus S15 in cash; this restriction was not lifted until 1979. The pound was devalued by 14.3% to $2.40 on 18 November 1967.[37][38]\\r\\nUntil decimalisation, amounts were stated in pounds, shillings, and pence, with various widely understood notations. The same amount was denoted by 32s 6d, 32/6, S1 12s 6d, S1/12/6. It was customary to specify some prices (for example professional fees and auction prices for works of art) in guineas (one guinea was 21 shillings) although guinea coins were no longer in use.\\r\\nFormal parliamentary proposals to decimalise sterling were first made in 1824 when Sir John Wrottesley, MP for Staffordshire, asked in the British House of Commons whether consideration had been given to decimalising the currency.[39] Wrottesley raised the issue in the House of Commons again in 1833,[40] and it was again raised by John Bowring, MP for Kilmarnock Burghs, in 1847[41] whose efforts led to the introduction in 1848 of what was in effect the first decimal coin in the United Kingdom, the florin, valued at one-tenth of a pound sterling. However, full decimalisation was resisted, although the florin coin, re-designated as ten new pence, survived the transfer to a full decimal system in 1971, with examples surviving in British coinage until 1993.\\r\\nJ. B. Smith, MP for Stirling Burghs, raised the issue of full decimalisation again in Parliament in 1853,[42] resulting in the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone, announcing soon afterwards that \\"the great question of a decimal coinage\\" was \\"now under serious consideration\\".[43] A full proposal for the decimalisation of sterling was then tabled in the House of Commons in June 1855, by William Brown, MP for Lancashire Southern, with the suggestion that the pound sterling be divided into one thousand parts, each called a \\"mil\\", or alternatively a farthing, as the pound was then equivalent to 960 farthings which could easily be rounded up to one thousand farthings in the new system.[44] This did not result in the conversion of the pound sterling into a decimal system, but it was agreed to establish a Royal Commission to look into the issue.[45] However, largely due to the hostility to decimalisation of two of the appointed commissioners, Lord Overstone (a banker) and John Hubbard (Governor of the Bank of England), decimalisation in Britain was effectively quashed for over a hundred years.[46]\\r\\nHowever, the pound sterling was decimalised in various British colonial territories before the United Kingdom (and in several cases in line with William Brown's proposal that the pound be divided into 1,000 parts, called mils). These included Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866;[47] Cyprus from 1955 until 1960 (and continued on the island as the division of the Cypriot pound until 1983); and the Palestine Mandate from 1926 until 1948.[48]\\r\\nTowards the end of the Second World War, various attempts to decimalise the pound sterling in the United Kingdom were made[citation needed]. Later, in 1966, the British government decided to include in the Queen's Speech a plan to convert the pound into a decimal currency.[49] As a result of this, on 15 February 1971, the UK decimalised the pound sterling, replacing the shilling and penny with a single subdivision, the new penny. For example, a price tag of S1 12s 6d became ?S1.62?1?2. The word \\"new\\" was omitted from coins minted after 1981.\\r\\nWith the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, the pound floated from August 1971 onwards. At first it appreciated a little, rising to almost $2.65 in March 1972 from $2.42, the upper bound of the band in which it had been fixed. The sterling area effectively ended at this time, when the majority of its members also chose to float freely against the pound and the dollar.\\r\\nJames Callaghan became Prime Minister in 1976. He was immediately told the economy was facing huge problems, according to documents released in 2006 by the National Archives.[50] The effects of the 1973 oil crisis were still being felt, with inflation rising to over 27% in 1975.[51] Financial markets were beginning to believe the pound was overvalued, and in April that year The Wall Street Journal advised the sale of sterling investments in the face of high taxes, in a story that ended with \\"goodbye, Great Britain. It was nice knowing you\\".[52] At the time the UK government was running a budget deficit, and Labour's strategy emphasised high public spending.[37] Callaghan was told there were three possible outcomes: a disastrous free fall in sterling, an internationally unacceptable siege economy, or a deal with key allies to prop up the pound while painful economic reforms were put in place. The US government feared the crisis could endanger NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC), and in light of this the US Treasury set out to force domestic policy changes. In November 1976 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the conditions for a loan, including deep cuts in public expenditure.[53]\\r\\nThe Conservative Party was elected to office in 1979, on a programme of fiscal austerity. Initially the pound rocketed, moving above US$2.40, as interest rates rose in response to the monetarist policy of targeting money supply. The high exchange rate was widely blamed for the deep recession of 1981. Sterling fell sharply after 1980; at its lowest, the pound stood at just $1.03 in March 1985, before rising to $1.70 in December 1989.[54]\\r\\nIn 1988, Margaret Thatcher's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, decided that the pound should \\"shadow\\" the West German Deutsche Mark, with the unintended result of a rapid rise in inflation as the economy boomed due to low interest rates. (For ideological reasons, the Conservative Government declined to use alternative mechanisms to control the explosion of credit. For this reason, former Prime Minister Edward Heath referred to Lawson as a \\"one club golfer\\").[55]\\r\\nFollowing German re-unification in 1990, the reverse held true, as high borrowing costs to fund Eastern reconstruction, a need exacerbated by the political choice to make the Ostmark equivalent to the Deutsche Mark (DM), meant rates in other countries shadowing the DM, especially the UK, were far too high relative to domestic circumstances, leading to a housing decline and recession.\\r\\nOn 8 October 1990 the Conservative government (Third Thatcher ministry) decided to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound set at DM2.95. However, the country was forced to withdraw from the system on \\"Black Wednesday\\" (16 September 1992) as Britain's economic performance made the exchange rate unsustainable.\\r\\n'Black Wednesday' saw interest rates jump from 10% to 15% in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the pound from falling below the ERM limits. The exchange rate fell to DM2.20. Those who had argued[56] for a lower GBP/DM exchange rate were vindicated as the cheaper pound encouraged exports and contributed to the economic prosperity of the 1990s.\\r\\nIn 1997, the newly elected Labour government handed over day-to-day control of interest rates to the Bank of England (a policy that had originally been advocated by the Liberal Democrats).[57] The Bank is now responsible for setting its base rate of interest so as to keep inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)) very close to 2% per annum. Should CPI inflation be more than one percentage point above or below the target, the governor of the Bank of England is required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer explaining the reasons for this and the measures which will be taken to bring this measure of inflation back in line with the 2% target. On 17 April 2007, annual CPI inflation was reported at 3.1% (inflation of the Retail Prices Index was 4.8%). Accordingly, and for the first time, the Governor had to write publicly to the government explaining why inflation was more than one percentage point higher than its target.[58]\\r\\nAs a member of the European Union, the United Kingdom could have adopted the euro as its currency. However, the subject was always politically controversial, and the UK negotiated an opt-out on this issue.\\r\\nIn 2007, Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, ruled out membership for the foreseeable future, saying that the decision not to join had been right for Britain and for Europe.[59]\\r\\nOn 1 January 2008, with the Republic of Cyprus switching its currency from the Cypriot pound to the euro, the British sovereign bases on Cyprus (Akrotiri and Dhekelia) followed suit making the Sovereign Base Areas the only territory under British sovereignty to officially use the euro.[60]\\r\\nThe 2016 referendum which started the process of United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union makes adoption of the euro almost impossible.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe government of former Prime Minister Tony Blair had pledged to hold a public referendum to decide on membership should \\"five economic tests\\" be met, to increase the likelihood that adoption of the euro would be in the national interest. In addition to these internal (national) criteria, the UK would have to meet the European Union's economic convergence criteria (Maastricht criteria) before being allowed to adopt the euro. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government (2010ÿ2015) ruled out joining the euro for that parliamentary term. Currently,[when?] the UK's annual government deficit, as a percentage of the GDP, is above the defined threshold.\\r\\nThe idea of replacing the pound with the euro was always controversial with the British public, partly because of the pound's identity as a symbol of British sovereignty and because it would, according to many critics, have led to suboptimal interest rates, harming the British economy.[61] In December 2008, the results of a BBC poll of 1000 people suggested that 71% would vote no to the euro, 23% would vote yes, while 6% said they were unsure.[62] The pound did not join the Second European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) after the euro was created. Denmark and the UK have opt-outs from entry to the euro. Theoretically, every other EU nation must eventually sign up.\\r\\nThe Scottish Conservative Party claimed that there was an issue for Scotland in that the adoption of the euro would mean the end of nationally distinctive banknotes, as the euro banknotes do not have national designs.[63] Before the 'No' vote in the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the Scottish National Party affirmed that the euro would not be the national currency of an independent Scotland.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe pound and the euro fluctuate in value against one another, although there may be correlation between movements in their respective exchange rates with other currencies such as the US dollar. Inflation concerns in the UK led the Bank of England to raise interest rates in late 2006 and 2007. This caused the pound to appreciate against other major currencies and, with the US dollar depreciating at the same time, the pound hit a 15-year high against the US dollar on 18 April 2007, reaching US$2 the day before, for the first time since 1992. The pound and many other currencies continued to appreciate against the dollar; sterling hit a 26-year high of US$2.1161 on 7 November 2007 as the dollar fell worldwide.[64] From mid-2003 to mid-2007, the pound/euro rate remained range-bound (within I 5%) of ?1.45.[65]\\r\\nFollowing the global financial crisis in late 2008, the pound depreciated sharply, reaching S1 per $1.38 (US) on 23 January 2009[66] and falling below ?1.25 against the euro in April 2008.[67] A further decline occurred during the remainder of 2008, most dramatically on 29 December when its euro rate hit an all-time low at ?1.0219, while its US dollar rate depreciated.[68][69] The pound appreciated in early 2009 reaching a peak against the euro in mid-July of ?1.17. The following months the pound remained broadly steady against the euro, with the pound's current (27 May 2011) value at ?1.15 and US$1.65.\\r\\nOn 5 March 2009, the Bank of England announced that it would pump S75 billion of new capital into the British economy, through a process known as quantitative easing. This was the first time in the United Kingdom's history that this measure had been used, although the Bank's Governor Mervyn King suggested it was not an experiment.[70]\\r\\nThe process saw the Bank of England creating new money for itself, which it then used to purchase assets such as government bonds, secured commercial paper, or corporate bonds.[71] The initial amount stated to be created through this method was S75 billion, although Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had given permission for up to S150 billion to be created if necessary.[72] It was expected that the process would occur over a period of three months with results only likely in the long term.[70] By 5 November 2009, some S175 billion had been injected using quantitative easing and the effectiveness of the process remained less successful in the long term. In July 2012, the final increase in the asset purchases finance meant QE had peaked at S375 billion, then holding solely UK Government bonds, representing one third of the UK national debt.[73]\\r\\nThe result of the 2016 UK referendum on EU membership caused a major decline in the pound against other world currencies as the future of international trade relationships and domestic political leadership became unclear.[74] The referendum result weakened sterling against euro overnight by 5%. The night before the vote S1 was trading for ?1.30; on the day following the referendum, when the result was clear, S1 was trading at ?1.23. By October 2016, the exchange rate was ?1.12 to the pound, a fall of 14% since the referendum. By the end of August 2017 the pound fell lower at ?1.08.[75] Against the US dollar, meanwhile, the pound fell from $1.466 to $1.3694 when the referendum result was first revealed, and down to $1.2232 by October 2016, a fall of 16%.[76]\\r\\nThe Bank of England had stated (2009) that the decision had been taken to prevent the rate of inflation falling below the 2% target rate.[71] Mervyn King, the Governor of the Bank of England, also had suggested there were no other monetary options left as interest rates had already been cut to their lowest level ever (0.5%) and it was unlikely that they would be cut further.[72]\\r\\nThe inflation rate per annum rose in following years, reaching 5.2% (based on the Consumer Price Index) in September 2011, then decreased to around 2.5% in the following year.[77]\\r\\nThe silver penny (plural: pence; abbreviation: d) was the principal and often the only coin in circulation from the 8th century until the 13th century. Although some fractions of the penny were struck (see farthing and halfpenny), it was more common to find pennies cut into halves and quarters to provide smaller change. Very few gold coins were struck, with the gold penny (worth 20 silver pence) a rare example. However, in 1279, the groat, worth 4d, was introduced, with the half groat following in 1344. 1344 also saw the establishment of a gold coinage with the introduction (after the failed gold florin) of the noble worth six shillings and eight pence (6/8) (i.e. 3 nobles to the pound), together with the half and quarter noble. Reforms in 1464 saw a reduction in value of the coinage in both silver and gold, with the noble renamed the ryal and worth 10/- (i.e. 2 to the pound) and the angel introduced at the noble's old value of 6/8.\\r\\nThe reign of Henry VII saw the introduction of two important coins: the shilling (abbr.: s; known as the testoon) in 1487 and the pound (known as the sovereign, abbr.: S or L) in 1489. In 1526, several new denominations of gold coins were added, including the crown and half crown worth five shillings (5/-), and two shillings and six pence (2/6, two and six) respectively. Henry VIII's reign (1509ÿ1547) saw a high level of debasement which continued into the reign of Edward VI (1547ÿ1553). This debasement was halted in 1552, and a new silver coinage was introduced, including coins for 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d and 6d, 1/-, 2/6 and 5/-. In the reign of Elizabeth I (1558ÿ1603), silver ?3?4d and ?1?1?2d coins were added, but these denominations did not last. Gold coins included the half-crown, crown, angel, half-sovereign and sovereign. Elizabeth's reign also saw the introduction of the horse-drawn screw press to produce the first \\"milled\\" coins.\\r\\nFollowing the succession of the Scottish King James VI to the English throne, a new gold coinage was introduced, including the spur ryal (15/-), the unite (20/-) and the rose ryal (30/-). The laurel, worth 20/-, followed in 1619. The first base metal coins were also introduced: tin and copper farthings. Copper halfpenny coins followed in the reign of Charles I. During the English Civil War, a number of siege coinages were produced, often in unusual denominations.\\r\\nFollowing the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the coinage was reformed, with the ending of production of hammered coins in 1662. The guinea was introduced in 1663, soon followed by the ?1?2, 2 and 5 guinea coins. The silver coinage consisted of denominations of 1d, 2d, 3d, 4d and 6d, 1/-, 2/6 and 5/-. Due to the widespread export of silver in the 18th century, the production of silver coins gradually came to a halt, with the half crown and crown not issued after the 1750s, the 6d and 1/- stopping production in the 1780s. In response, copper 1d and 2d coins and a gold ?1?3 guinea (7/-) were introduced in 1797. The copper penny was the only one of these coins to survive long.\\r\\nTo alleviate the shortage of silver coins, between 1797 and 1804, the Bank of England counterstamped Spanish dollars (8 reales) and other Spanish and Spanish colonial coins for circulation. A small counterstamp of the King's head was used. Until 1800, these circulated at a rate of 4/9 for 8 reales. After 1800, a rate of 5/- for 8 reales was used. The Bank then issued silver tokens for 5/- (struck over Spanish dollars) in 1804, followed by tokens for 1/6 and 3/- between 1811 and 1816.\\r\\nIn 1816, a new silver coinage was introduced in denominations of 6d, 1/-, 2/6 (half-crown) and 5/- (crown). The crown was only issued intermittently until 1900. It was followed by a new gold coinage in 1817 consisting of 10/- and S1 coins, known as the half sovereign and sovereign. The silver 4d coin was reintroduced in 1836, followed by the 3d in 1838, with the 4d coin issued only for colonial use after 1855. In 1848, the 2/- florin was introduced, followed by the short-lived double florin in 1887. In 1860, copper was replaced by bronze in the farthing (quarter penny, ?1?4d), halfpenny and penny.\\r\\nDuring the First World War, production of the sovereign and half-sovereign was suspended, and although the gold standard was later restored, the coins saw little circulation thereafter. In 1920, the silver standard, maintained at .925 since 1552, was reduced to .500. In 1937, a nickel-brass 3d coin was introduced; the last silver 3d coins were issued seven years later. In 1947, the remaining silver coins were replaced with cupro-nickel, with the exception of Maundy coinage which was then restored to .925. Inflation caused the farthing to cease production in 1956 and be demonetised in 1960. In the run-up to decimalisation, the halfpenny and half-crown were demonetised in 1969.\\r\\nBritish coinage timeline:\\r\\nAt present, the oldest circulating coins in the UK are the 1p and 2p copper coins introduced in 1971. No other coins from before 1982 are in circulation. Prior to the demonetisation of the larger 10p in 1993, the oldest circulating coins had usually dated from 1947: although older coins (shilling; florin, sixpence to 1980) were still legal tender, inflation meant that their silver content was worth more than their face value, which meant that they tended to be removed from circulation. Before decimalisation in 1971, a handful of change might have contained coins 100 or more years old, bearing any of five monarchs' heads, especially in the copper coins.\\r\\nThe first sterling notes were issued by the Bank of England shortly after its foundation in 1694. Denominations were initially handwritten on the notes at the time of issue. From 1745, the notes were printed in denominations between S20 and S1000, with any odd shillings added by hand. S10 notes were added in 1759, followed by S5 in 1793 and S1 and S2 in 1797. The lowest two denominations were withdrawn after the end of the Napoleonic wars. In 1855, the notes were converted to being entirely printed, with denominations of S5, S10, S20, S50, S100, S200, S300, S500 and S1000 issued.\\r\\nThe Bank of Scotland began issuing notes in 1695. Although the pound Scots was still the currency of Scotland, these notes were denominated in sterling in values up to S100. From 1727, the Royal Bank of Scotland also issued notes. Both banks issued some notes denominated in guineas as well as pounds. In the 19th century, regulations limited the smallest note issued by Scottish banks to be the S1 denomination, a note not permitted in England.\\r\\nWith the extension of sterling to Ireland in 1825, the Bank of Ireland began issuing sterling notes, later followed by other Irish banks. These notes included the unusual denominations of 30/- and S3. The highest denomination issued by the Irish banks was S100.\\r\\nIn 1826, banks at least 65 miles (105?km) from London were given permission to issue their own paper money. From 1844, new banks were excluded from issuing notes in England and Wales but not in Scotland and Ireland. Consequently, the number of private banknotes dwindled in England and Wales but proliferated in Scotland and Ireland. The last English private banknotes were issued in 1921.\\r\\nIn 1914, the Treasury introduced notes for 10/- and S1 to replace gold coins. These circulated until 1928, when they were replaced by Bank of England notes. Irish independence reduced the number of Irish banks issuing sterling notes to five operating in Northern Ireland. The Second World War had a drastic effect on the note production of the Bank of England. Fearful of mass forgery by the Nazis (see Operation Bernhard), all notes for S10 and above ceased production, leaving the bank to issue only 10/-, S1 and S5 notes. Scottish and Northern Irish issues were unaffected, with issues in denominations of S1, S5, S10, S20, S50 and S100.\\r\\nThe Bank of England reintroduced S10 notes in 1964. In 1969, the 10/- note was replaced by the 50p coin to prepare for decimalisation. S20 Bank of England notes were reintroduced in 1970, followed by S50 in 1981.[79] A S1 coin was introduced in 1983, and Bank of England S1 notes were withdrawn in 1988. Scottish and Northern Irish banks followed, with only the Royal Bank of Scotland continuing to issue this denomination.\\r\\nUK notes include raised print (e.g. on the words \\"Bank of England\\"); watermarks; embedded metallic thread; holograms; and fluorescent ink visible only under UV lamps. Three printing techniques are involved: offset litho, intaglio and letterpress; and the notes incorporate a total of 85 specialized inks.[80]\\r\\nThe Bank of England produces notes named \\"giant\\" and \\"titan\\".[81] A giant is a one million pound note, and a titan is a one hundred million pound bank note,[82] of which there are about 40. Giants and titans are used only within the banking system.\\r\\nThe S5 polymer banknote, issued by Northern Bank (now Danske Bank) in 2000, was the only polymer note in circulation until 2016, although Danske Bank also produces paper-based S10, S20 and S50 notes. The Bank of England introduced S5 polymer banknotes in September 2016, and the paper S5 notes were withdrawn on 5 May 2017. This date was picked due to its short format, 5/5.[citation needed] A polymer S10 banknote was introduced on 14 September 2017, and the paper note was withdrawn on 1 March 2018. A polymer S20 banknote will be introduced in 2020.[83]\\r\\nAs the central bank of the United Kingdom which has been delegated authority by the government, the Bank of England sets the monetary policy for the British pound by controlling the amount of money in circulation. It has a monopoly on issuance of banknotes in England and Wales, and regulates the amount of banknotes issued by seven authorized banks in Scotland and Northern Ireland.[84] HM Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee \\"if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances\\" but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days.[85]\\r\\nUnlike banknotes which have separate issuers in Scotland and Northern Ireland, all UK coins are issued by the Royal Mint, which is an independent enterprise (wholly owned by the Treasury) which also mints coins for other countries.\\r\\nIn Britain's Crown Dependencies, the Manx pound, Jersey pound, and Guernsey pound are unregulated by the Bank of England and are issued independently.[86] However, they are maintained at a fixed exchange rate by their respective governments, and Bank of England notes have been made legal tender on the islands, forming a sort of one-way de facto currency union. These currencies do not have ISO 4217 codes so \\"GBP\\" is usually used to represent all of them; informal codes are used where the difference is important.\\r\\nBritish Overseas Territories are responsible for the monetary policy of their own currencies (where they exist),[87] and have their own ISO 4217 codes. The Falkland Islands pound, Gibraltar pound, and Saint Helena pound are set at a fixed 1:1 exchange rate with the British pound by local governments.\\r\\nLegal tender in the United Kingdom is defined such that \\"a debtor cannot successfully be sued for non-payment if he pays into court in legal tender.\\" Parties can alternatively settle a debt by other means with mutual consent. Strictly speaking it is necessary for the debtor to offer the exact amount due as there is no obligation for the other party to provide change.[88]\\r\\nThroughout the UK, S1 and S2 coins are legal tender for any amount, with the other coins being legal tender only for limited amounts. Bank of England notes are legal tender for any amount in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland.[89] (Bank of England 10/- and S1 notes were legal tender, as were Scottish banknotes, during World War II under the Currency (Defence) Act 1939, which was repealed on 1 January 1946.) Channel Islands and Isle of Man banknotes are legal tender only in their respective jurisdictions.\\r\\nBank of England, Scottish, Northern Irish, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, and Falkland banknotes may be offered anywhere in the UK, although there is no obligation to accept them as a means of payment, and acceptance varies. For example, merchants in England generally accept Scottish and Northern Irish bills, but some unfamiliar with them may reject them.[90] However, Scottish and Northern Irish bills both tend to be accepted in Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively. Merchants in England generally do not accept Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Gibraltar, and Falkland notes,[citation needed] but Isle of Man notes are generally accepted in Scotland and Northern Ireland.[citation needed] Bank of England notes are generally accepted in the Falklands and Gibraltar, but for example Scottish and Northern Irish notes are not.[91] Since all of the bills are denominated in pounds sterling, banks will exchange them for locally issued bills at face value,[citation needed] though some in the UK have had trouble exchanging Falkland Islands pounds.[92]\\r\\nCommemorative S5 and 25p (crown) coins, rarely seen in circulation, are legal tender, as are the bullion coins issued by the Mint.\\r\\nIn 2006, the House of Commons Library published a research paper which included an index of prices in pounds for each year between 1750 and 2005, where 1974 was indexed at 100.[95]\\r\\nRegarding the period 1750ÿ1914 the document states: \\"Although there was considerable year on year fluctuation in price levels prior to 1914 (reflecting the quality of the harvest, wars, etc.) there was not the long-term steady increase in prices associated with the period since 1945\\". It goes on to say that \\"Since 1945 prices have risen in every year with an aggregate rise of over 27 times\\".\\r\\nThe value of the index in 1751 was 5.1, increasing to a peak of 16.3 in 1813 before declining very soon after the end of the Napoleonic Wars to around 10.0 and remaining in the range 8.5ÿ10.0 at the end of the nineteenth century. The index was 9.8 in 1914 and peaked at 25.3 in 1920, before declining to 15.8 in 1933 and 1934prices were only about three times as high as they had been 180 years earlier.[96]\\r\\nInflation had a dramatic effect during and after World War IIthe index was 20.2 in 1940, 33.0 in 1950, 49.1 in 1960, 73.1 in 1970, 263.7 in 1980, 497.5 in 1990, 671.8 in 2000 and 757.3 in 2005.\\r\\nThe following table shows the equivalent amount of goods and services that, in a particular year, could be purchased with S1.[97][98]\\r\\nThe table shows that from 1971 to 2015 the British pound lost about 92% of its buying power.\\r\\nThe smallest coin in 1971 was the ?1?2p, worth about 6.4p in 2015 prices.\\r\\nThe pound is freely bought and sold on the foreign exchange markets around the world, and its value relative to other currencies therefore fluctuates.[99]\\r\\nAs of 27?August?2017[update], S1 was worth US$1.289, ?1.0808, 141, CHF 1.22329, A$1.6247, C$1.6083 or INR 82.50.\\r\\nSterling is used as a reserve currency around the world and is currently ranked fourth in value held as reserves.","input":"What is the currency in the uk called?"},{"output":"convergent plate boundary","context":"The Aleutian Trench (or Aleutian Trough)[1] is an oceanic trench along a convergent plate boundary which runs along the southern coastline of Alaska and the Aleutian islands.

Based in Montgomery, Alabama, it is noted for its successful legal cases against white supremacist groups, its classification of hate groups and other extremist organizations, and for promoting tolerance education programs.[3][4][5]\\r\\nSPLC was founded by Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in 1971 as a civil rights law firm in Montgomery.[6] Civil rights leader Julian Bond served as president of the board between 1971 and 1979.[7]\\r\\nIn 1979, the SPLC began a litigation strategy of filing civil suits for monetary damages on behalf of the victims of violence from the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, with all damages recovered given to the victims or donated to other organizations. The SPLC also became involved in other civil rights causes, including cases to challenge what it sees as institutional racial segregation and discrimination, inhumane and unconstitutional conditions in prisons and detention centers, discrimination based on sexual orientation, mistreatment of illegal immigrants, and the unconstitutional mixing of church and state. The SPLC has provided information about hate groups to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies.[8][9]\\r\\nThe SPLC's classification and listings of hate groups and extremists (organizations and people that, in its assessment, \\"attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics\\")[10] are considered authoritative by academic and media sources[11][12][13][14] but have been the subject of criticism from conservatives and others, who have argued that some of the SPLC's listings are overbroad or unwarranted.[15][16]\\r\\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center was founded by civil rights lawyers Morris Dees and Joseph J. Levin Jr. in August 1971[17] as a law firm originally focused on issues such as fighting poverty, racial discrimination and the death penalty in the United States. The SPLC's first president was Julian Bond, who served until 1979 and then remained on the board of directors until his death in 2015. In 1979, Dees and the SPLC began filing civil lawsuits against Ku Klux Klan chapters and similar organizations for monetary damages on behalf of their victims; the favorable verdicts from these suits served to bankrupt the KKK and other targeted organizations.[18] In 1981, the Center began its Klanwatch project to monitor the activities of the KKK. That project, now called Hatewatch, was later expanded to include seven other types of hate organizations.[19]\\r\\nIn 1986, the entire legal staff of the SPLC, excluding Dees, resigned as the organization shifted from traditional civil rights work toward fighting right-wing extremism.[18] In 1989, the Center unveiled its Civil Rights Memorial, which was designed by Maya Lin.[20] The Center's \\"Teaching Tolerance\\" project was initiated in 1991.[21] In 2008, the SPLC and Dees were featured on National Geographic's Inside American Terror explaining their litigation strategy against the Ku Klux Klan.[22]\\r\\nIn July 1983, the SPLC headquarters was firebombed, destroying the building and records.[23] As a result of the arson, Klansmen Joe M. Garner and Roy T. Downs Jr., along with Klan sympathizer Charles Bailey, pleaded guilty in February 1985 to conspiring to intimidate, oppress and threaten members of black organizations represented by SPLC.[24] The SPLC built a new headquarters building from 1999 to 2001.[25]\\r\\nIn 1984, Dees became an assassination target of The Order, a revolutionary white supremacist group.[26] By 2007, according to Dees, more than 30 people had been jailed in connection with plots to kill him or to blow up SPLC offices.[27]\\r\\nIn 1995, four men were indicted for planning to blow up the SPLC.[28] In May 1998, three white supremacists were arrested for allegedly planning a nationwide campaign of assassinations and bombings targeting \\"Morris Dees, an undisclosed federal judge in Illinois, a black radio show host in Missouri, Dees's Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama, the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, and the Anti-Defamation League in New York.\\"[29]\\r\\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has initiated a number of civil cases seeking injunctive relief and monetary awards on behalf of its clients. The SPLC has said it does not accept any portion of monetary judgements.[30][31] Dees and the SPLC \\"have been credited with devising innovative legal ways to cripple hate groups, including seizing their assets.\\"[32] However, this has led to criticism from some civil libertarians, who contend that the SPLC's tactics chill free speech and set legal precedents that could be applied against activist groups which are not hate groups.[18] The SPLC has also filed suits related to the conditions of incarceration for adults and juveniles.\\r\\nAn early SPLC case was Sims v. Amos (consolidated with Nixon v. Brewer) in which a Federal District Court in Alabama ordered the state legislature to reapportion its election system. The result of the decision, which was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, was that 15 black legislators were elected in 1974.[33]\\r\\nIn 1981, the SPLC took Ku Klux Klan leader Louis Beam's Klan-associated militia, the Texas Emergency Reserve (TER),[34] to court to stop racial harassment and intimidation of Vietnamese shrimpers in and around Galveston Bay.[35] The Klan's actions against approximately 100 Vietnamese shrimpers in the area included a cross burning,[36] sniper fire aimed at them, and arsonists burning their boats.[37]\\r\\nIn May 1981, U.S. District Court judge Gabrielle McDonald[38] issued a preliminary injunction against the Klan, requiring them to cease intimidating, threatening, or harassing the Vietnamese.[39] McDonald eventually found the TER and Beam liable for tortious interference, violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and of various civil rights statutes and thus permanently enjoined them against violence, threatening behavior, and other harassment of the Vietnamese shrimpers.[38] The SPLC also uncovered an obscure Texas law \\"that forbade private armies in that state.\\"[40] McDonald found that Beam's organization violated it and hence ordered the TER to close its military training camp.[40]\\r\\nIn 1982, armed members of the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan terrorized Bobby Person, a black prison guard, and members of his family. They harassed and threatened others, including a white woman who had befriended blacks. In 1984, Person became the lead plaintiff in Person v. Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a lawsuit brought by the SPLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The harassment and threats continued during litigation and the court issued an order prohibiting any person from interfering with others inside the courthouse.[41] In January 1985, the court issued a consent order that prohibited the group's \\"Grand Dragon\\", Frazier Glenn Miller, Jr., and his followers from operating a paramilitary organization, holding parades in black neighborhoods, and from harassing, threatening or harming any black person or white persons who associated with black persons. Subsequently, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for damages.[41]\\r\\nWithin a year, the court found Miller and his followers, now calling themselves the White Patriot Party, in criminal contempt for violating the consent order. Miller was sentenced to six months in prison followed by a three-year probationary period, during which he was banned from associating with members of any racist group such as the White Patriot Party. Miller refused to obey the terms of his probation. He made underground \\"declarations of war\\" against Jews and the federal government before being arrested again. Found guilty of weapons violations, he went to federal prison for three years.[42][43]\\r\\nIn 1987, SPLC won a case against the United Klans of America for the lynching of Michael Donald, a black teenager in Mobile, Alabama.[44] The SPLC used an unprecedented legal strategy of holding an organization responsible for the crimes of individual members to help produce a $7?million judgement for the victim's mother.[44] The verdict forced United Klans of America into bankruptcy. Its national headquarters was sold for approximately $52,000 to help satisfy the judgement.[45] In 1987, five members of a Klan offshoot, the White Patriot Party, were indicted for stealing military weaponry and plotting to kill Dees.[46] The SPLC has since successfully used this precedent to force numerous Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups into bankruptcy.[47]\\r\\nOn November 13, 1988, in Portland, Oregon, three white supremacist members of East Side White Pride and White Aryan Resistance (WAR) fatally assaulted Mulugeta Seraw, an Ethiopian man who came to the United States to attend college.[48] In October 1990, the SPLC won a civil case on behalf of Seraw's family against WAR's operator Tom Metzger and his son, John, for a total of $12.5?million.[49][50] The Metzgers declared bankruptcy, and WAR went out of business. The cost of work for the trial was absorbed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as well as the SPLC.[51] As of August?2007[update], Metzger still makes payments to Seraw's family.[52][needs update]\\r\\nIn May 1991, Harold Mansfield, a black U.S. Navy war veteran, was murdered by George Loeb, a member of the neo-Nazi \\"Church of the Creator\\" (now called the Creativity Movement).[53] SPLC represented the victim's family in a civil case and won a judgement of $1?million from the church in March 1994.[54] The church transferred ownership to William Pierce, head of the National Alliance, to avoid paying money to Mansfield's heirs. The SPLC filed suit against Pierce for his role in the fraudulent scheme and won an $85,000 judgement against him in 1995.[55] The amount was upheld on appeal and the money was collected prior to Pierce's death in 2002.[55]\\r\\nThe SPLC won a $37.8?million verdict on behalf of Macedonia Baptist Church, a 100-year-old black church in Manning, South Carolina, against two Ku Klux Klan chapters and five Klansmen (Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and Invisible Empire, Inc.) in July 1998.[56] The money was awarded stemming from arson convictions; these Klan units burned down the historic black church in 1995.[57] Morris Dees told the press, \\"If we put the Christian Knights out of business, what's that worth? We don't look at what we can collect. It's what the jury thinks this egregious conduct is worth that matters, along with the message it sends.\\" According to The Washington Post the amount is the \\"largest-ever civil award for damages in a hate crime case.\\"[58]\\r\\nIn September 2000, the SPLC won a $6.3?million judgement against the Aryan Nations (AN) from an Idaho jury who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to a woman and her son who were attacked by Aryan Nations guards.[6] The lawsuit stemmed from the July 1998 attack when security guards at the Aryan Nations compound near Hayden Lake in northern Idaho, shot at Victoria Keenan and her son.[59] Bullets struck their car several times, causing the car to crash. An Aryan Nations member held the Keenans at gunpoint.[59] As a result of the judgement, Richard Butler turned over the 20-acre (81,000?m2) compound to the Keenans, who sold the property to a philanthropist. He donated the land to North Idaho College, which designated the area as a \\"peace park\\".[60] Because of the lawsuit, members of the AN drew up a plan to kill Dees, which was disrupted by the FBI.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2002, the SPLC and the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit (Glassroth v. Moore) against Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore for placing a display of the Ten Commandments in the rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building. Moore, who had final authority over what decorations were to be placed in the Alabama State Judicial Building's Rotunda, had installed a 5,280?pound (2400?kg) granite block, three feet wide by three feet deep by four feet tall, of the Ten Commandments late at night without the knowledge of any other court justice. After defying several court rulings, Moore was eventually removed from the court and the Supreme Court justices had the monument removed from the building.[61]\\r\\nOn March 18, 2003, two illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Edwin Alfredo Manca Gonzles and Ftima del Socorro Leiva Medina, were trespassing through a Texas ranch owned by Joseph Sutton. They were accosted by vigilantes known as Ranch Rescue, who were recruited by Sutton to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border region nearby.[42] Manca, Leiva, and the SPLC alleged that members of Ranch Rescue held the two migrants at gunpoint, threatened them with death, and otherwise terrorized them; they also alleged that Manca was struck on the back of the head with a handgun and that a Rottweiler dog was allowed to attack him.[42][62] Manca and Leiva also stated that the vigilantes gave them water, cookies and a blanket before letting them go after about an hour.[62]\\r\\nLater that year, SPLC, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and local attorneys filed a civil suit, Leiva v. Ranch Rescue, in Jim Hogg County, Texas, against Ranch Rescue and several of its associates, seeking damages for assault and illegal detention. In April 2005, SPLC obtained judgements totaling $1 million against Ranch Rescue member Casey James Nethercott and Ranch Rescue's leader, Torre John Foote. Those awards came six months after a $350,000 judgement in the same case and coincided with a $100,000 out-of-court settlement with Sutton. Nethercotts 70-acre (280,000?m2) Arizona property, which was Ranch Rescue's headquarters, was seized to pay the judgement. Nethercott was also charged by Texas prosecutors of pistol-whipping Manca (which Nethercott denied). A jury deadlocked on the pistol-whipping charge but convicted Nethercott of being a felon in possession of a firearm (as he had a prior assault conviction in California).[62] SPLC staff worked with Texas prosecutors to obtain Nethercott's conviction.[42][63]\\r\\nThe SPLC brought a civil suit on behalf of Billy Ray Johnson, a black, mentally disabled man, who was severely beaten by four white males in Texas and left bleeding in a ditch, suffering permanent injuries. In 2007, Johnson was awarded $9?million in damages by a Linden, Texas jury.[64][65] At a criminal trial, the four men were convicted of assault and received sentences of 30 to 60?days in county jail.[66][67]\\r\\nIn November 2008, the SPLC's case against the Imperial Klans of America (IKA), the nation's second-largest Klan organization, went to trial in Meade County, Kentucky.[68] The SPLC had filed suit for damages in July 2007 on behalf of Jordan Gruver and his mother against the IKA in Kentucky. In July 2006, five Klan members went to the Meade County Fairgrounds in Brandenburg, Kentucky, \\"to hand out business cards and flyers advertising a 'white-only' IKA function\\". Two members of the Klan started calling Gruver, a 16-year-old boy of Panamanian descent, a \\"spic\\".[69] Subsequently, the boy, (5?feet 3?inches (1.60?m) and weighing 150 pounds (68?kg)) was beaten and kicked by the Klansmen (one of whom was 6?feet 5?inches (1.96?m) and 300 pounds (140?kg)). As a result, the victim received \\"two cracked ribs, a broken left forearm, multiple cuts and bruises and jaw injuries requiring extensive dental repair.\\"[69]\\r\\nIn a related criminal case in February 2007, Jarred Hensley and Andrew Watkins were sentenced to three years in prison for beating Gruver.[68] On November 14, 2008, an all-white jury of seven men and seven women awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages to the plaintiff against Ron Edwards, Imperial Wizard of the group, and Jarred Hensley, who participated in the attack.[70]\\r\\nTogether with the ACLU National Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in November 2010 against the owner/operators of the private Walnut Grove Youth Correctional Facility in Leake County, Mississippi, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDC). They charged that conditions, including under-staffing and neglect of medical care, produced numerous and repeated abuses of youthful prisoners, high rates of violence and injury, and that one prisoner suffered brain damage because of inmate-on-inmate attacks.[71] A federal civil rights investigation was undertaken by the United States Department of Justice. In settling the suit, Mississippi ended its contract with GEO Group in 2012. Additionally, under the court decree, the MDC moved the youthful offenders to state-run units. In 2012, Mississippi opened a new youthful offender unit at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County.[72] The state also agreed to not subject youthful offenders to solitary confinement and a court monitor conducted regular reviews of conditions at the facility.[73]\\r\\nAlso with the ACLU Prison Project, the SPLC filed a class-action suit in May 2013 against Management and Training Corporation (MTC), the for-profit operator of the private East Mississippi Correctional Facility, and the MDC.[74] Management and Training Corporation had been awarded a contract for this and two other facilities in Mississippi in 2012 following the removal of GEO Group. The suit charged failure of MTC to make needed improvements, and to maintain proper conditions and treatment for this special needs population of prisoners.[75] In 2015 the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification.[76][needs update]\\r\\nIn 2012, the SPLC initiated a class action federal lawsuit against the Polk County, Florida sheriff, Grady Judd, alleging that seven juveniles confined by the sheriff were suffering in improper conditions.[77] U.S. District Court Judge Steven D. Merryday found in favor of Judd, who said the SPLC's allegations \\"were not supported by the facts or court precedence  [sic].\\"[78] The judge wrote that \\"the conditions of juvenile detention at (Central County Jail) are not consistent with (Southern Poverty's) dark, grim, and condemning portrayal.\\"[79] While the county sheriff's department did not recover an estimated $1 million in attorney's fees defending the case, Judge Merryday did award $103,000 in court costs to Polk County.[80]\\r\\nIn April 2017, the SPLC filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Tanya Gersh, accusing Andrew Anglin, publisher of the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer, of instigating an anti-Semitic harassment campaign against Gersh, a Whitefish, Montana, real estate agent.[81][82]\\r\\nSPLC's projects include the website Tolerance.org, which provides news on tolerance issues, education for children, guidebooks for activists, and resources for parents and teachers.[83] The website received Webby Awards in 2002 and 2004 for Best Activism.[84] Another product of Tolerance.org is the \\"10 Ways To Fight Hate on Campus: A Response Guide for College Activists\\" booklet.[85]\\r\\nThe SPLC also produces documentary films. Two have won Academy Awards for Documentary Short Subject: A Time for Justice (1994) and Mighty Times: The Children's March (2004).[86] In 2017 the SPLC began developing a 6-part series with Black Box Management to document \\"the normalization of far-right extremism in the age of Donald Trump.\\"[87]\\r\\nThe SPLC cooperates with, and offers training to, law enforcement agencies, focusing \\"on the history, background, leaders, and activities of far-right extremists in the United States\\".[88] The FBI has partnered with the SPLC and many other organizations \\"to establish rapport, share information, address concerns, and cooperate in solving problems\\" related to hate crimes.[89]\\r\\nThe SPLC is the organization most widely associated with tracking hate groups in the United States. It maintains lists of hate groups, which they define as groups that \\"... have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics\\". It says that hate group activities may include speeches, marches, rallies, meetings, publishing, leafleting, and criminal acts such as violence. (Not all groups so listed by the SPLC engage in criminal activity.) The process for determining which groups are included involves \\"talking through\\" cases that are not clear-cut.[10][90]\\r\\nIn 2018, the SPLC added male supremacy groups to their hate group list; specifically A Voice for Men and Return of Kings.[91]\\r\\nSince 1981, the SPLC's Intelligence Project has published a quarterly Intelligence Report that monitors what the SPLC considers radical right hate groups and extremists in the United States.[92] The Intelligence Report provides information regarding organizational efforts and tactics of these groups and persons, and has been cited by scholars as a reliable and comprehensive source on U.S. right-wing extremism and hate groups.[93] The SPLC also publishes HateWatch Weekly, a newsletter that follows racism and extremism, and the Hatewatch blog, whose subtitle is \\"Keeping an Eye on the Radical Right\\".[94]\\r\\nTwo articles published in Intelligence Report have won \\"Green Eyeshade Excellence in Journalism\\" awards from the Society of Professional Journalists. \\"Communing with the Council\\", written by Heidi Beirich and Bob Moser, took third place for Investigative Journalism in the Magazine Division in 2004, and \\"Southern Gothic\\", by David Holthouse and Casey Sanchez, took second place for Feature Reporting in the Magazine Division in 2007.[95]\\r\\nSince 2001, the SPLC has released an annual issue of the Intelligence Project called Year in Hate, later renamed Year in Hate and Extremism, in which they present statistics on the numbers of hate groups in America. The current format of the report covers racial hate groups, nativist hate groups, and other right-wing extremist groups such as groups within the Patriot Movement.[96] Jesse Walker, writing in Reason.com, criticized the 2016 report, questioning whether the count was reliable, as it focused on the number of groups rather than the number of people in those groups or the size of the groups. Walker gives the example that the 2016 report itself concedes an increase in the number of KKK groups could be due to two large groups falling apart, leading to members creating smaller local groups.[97]\\r\\nIn their study of the white separatist movement in the United States, sociologists Betty A. Dobratz and Stephanie L. Shanks-Meile referred to the SPLC's Klanwatch Intelligence Reports in saying \\"we relied on the SPLC and ADL for general information, but we have noted differences between the way events have been reported and what we saw at rallies. For instance, events were sometimes portrayed in Klanwatch Intelligence Reports as more militant and dangerous with higher turnouts than we observed.\\"[98]\\r\\nIn 2013, J.M. Berger wrote in Foreign Policy that media organizations should be more cautious when citing the SPLC and ADL, arguing that they are \\"not objective purveyors of data\\".[99]\\r\\nThe SPLC's identification and listings of hate groups and extremists has been the subject of controversy. Critics of the SPLC say that it chooses its causes with funding and donations in mind,[98] and argue that people and groups designated as 'hate groups' are often targeted by protests that prevent them from speaking. The SPLC sometimes responds by reviewing its actions and removing people or organizations from hate listings, such as that of Ben Carson; however, it has stood behind the vast majority of its listings.[15][100][101]\\r\\nThe SPLC's activities, including litigation, are supported by fundraising efforts, and it does not accept any fees or share in legal judgements awarded to clients it represents in court. Starting in 1974, the SPLC set aside money for its endowment stating that it was \\"convinced that the day [would] come when non-profit groups [would] no longer be able to rely on support through mail because of posting and printing costs\\".[122] For 2016, its endowment was approximately $319 million per its annual report and SPLC spent 68% of its revenue on programs.[1]\\r\\nIn 1994 the Montgomery Advertiser published an eight-part critical report on the SPLC, saying that it exaggerated the threat posed by the Klan and similar groups in order to raise money, discriminated against black employees, and used misleading fundraising tactics. The SPLC dismissed the series as a \\"hatchet job\\". SPLC's co-founder Joe Levin stated: \\"The Advertiser's lack of interest in the center's programs and its obsessive interest in the center's financial affairs and Mr. Dees' personal life makes it obvious to me that the Advertiser simply wants to smear the center and Mr. Dees.\\"[citation needed][123] The series was nominated for a 1995 Pulitzer Prize in Explanatory Journalism. Despite an SPLC campaign against the nomination the series was one of three finalists.[124]\\r\\nStarting in the 1990s, Ken Silverstein writing in Harper's Magazine and others were critical of the SPLC's fundraising appeals and finances, alleging that the group has used hyperbole and overstated the prevalence of hate groups to raise large amounts of money.[125]\\r\\nBased on 2015 figures, Charity Navigator rated the SPLC three out of four stars?ÿ 80.44 on financial health matters, 97.00 on accountability and transparency, and 86.00 (out of 100) overall; and GuideStar gives the SPLC a Gold-level rating.[126]","input":"Where is the southern poverty law center located?"},{"output":"Ford Ranchero coup utility","context":"Chevrolet El Camino is a coup utility  vehicle that was produced by Chevrolet between 1959ÿ60 and 1964ÿ1987. Unlike a pickup truck, the El Camino was adapted from a two-door station wagon platform that integrated the cab and cargo bed into the body. \\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduced in the 1959 model year in response to the success of the Ford Ranchero coup utility, its first run lasted only two years. Production resumed for the 1964ÿ1977 model years based on the Chevelle platform, and continued for the 1978ÿ1987 model years based on the GM G-body platform.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough based on corresponding General Motors car lines, the vehicle is classified and titled in North America as a SUV. GMC's badge engineered El Camino variant, the Sprint, was introduced for the 1971 model year. Renamed Caballero in 1978, it was also produced through the 1987 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFord Australia was the first company to produce a coup utility as a result of a 1932 letter from the wife of a farmer in Victoria, Australia, asking for \\"a vehicle to go to church in on a Sunday and which can carry our pigs to market on Mondays\\".[1] Ford designer Lew Bandt developed a suitable solution, and the first coup utility model was released in 1934.[1] Bandt went on to manage Fords Advanced Design Department, being responsible for the body engineering of the XP, XT, XW, and XA series Ford Falcon utilities. General Motors Australian subsidiary Holden also produced a Chevrolet coup utility in 1935, Studebaker produced the Coup Express from 1937 to 1939. The body style did not reappear on the American market until the release of the 1957 Ford Ranchero.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the coup utility and the similar open-topped roadster utility continued in production, but the improving economy of the mid- to late-1930s and the desire for improved comfort saw coup utility sales climb at the expense of the roadster utility until, by 1939, the latter was all but a fading memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mid-1955 introduction of Chevrolet's Cameo Carrier pickup truck helped pave the way for the El Camino. Although it was a model variant of Chevrolet's Task Force light-duty pickup, the Cameo offered an array of car-like features that included passenger-car styling, fiberglass rear fenders, two-tone paint, a relatively luxurious interior, as well as an optional V8 engine, automatic transmission, and power assists.[2] As always, there was a GMC version offered during the same time, called the GMC Suburban Carrier with the same features offered on the Chevrolet. In 1957 a special version was made for GMC to be shown at national car shows called the Palomino,[3] which had a Pontiac 347?cu?in (5.7?L) V8 installed, borrowed from the 1957 Star Chief.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther pickup truck producers, including Dodge, Ford, Studebaker, and International, began to offer flush-side cargo boxes on some of their 1957 models, such as the Dodge C Series, and the Studebaker E-series Deluxe. However, Ford also introduced the 1957 Ranchero, and established a new market segment in the U.S. market of an automobile platform based coup utility. In 1959, Chevrolet responded with the El Camino to compete with Ford's full-sized Ranchero. The original El Camino and Ranchero would compete directly only in the 1959 model year.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n1955 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier\\r\\n\\r\\n1955 GMC Suburban Carrier\\r\\n\\r\\n1956 Chevrolet Cameo Carrier rear view\\r\\n\\r\\n1957 GMC Suburban Carrier\\r\\n\\r\\n1957 GMC Palomino\\r\\n\\r\\n1958 GMC Suburban Carrier\\r\\n\\r\\n1959 GMC Suburban Carrier rear view\\r\\n\\r\\nThe El Camino was introduced for the 1959 model year two years after the Ford Ranchero. According to Chevrolet stylist Chuck Jordan, GM Harley Earl had suggested a coup pickup in 1952.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the Ranchero, it was based on an existing and modified platform, the new-for-1959 Brookwood two-door station wagon, itself based on the completely redesigned, longer, lower and wider full-sized Chevrolet. Highly stylized, it initially sold 50% more briskly than the more conservative Ranchero, some 22,000 to 14,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the Brookwoods wagon and a sedan delivery variant, the El Camino was available with any full-sized Chevrolet drivetrain. It came in a single trim level, its exterior using the mid-level Bel-Air's trim, and the interior of the low-end Biscayne. Its chassis featured Chevrolet's \\"Safety-Girder\\" X-frame design and a full-coil suspension, both introduced in the 1958 model year. The 119-inch (3,000?mm) wheel-base was 1.5 inches (38?mm) longer, and overall length for all 1959 Chevrolets was up to 210.9 inches (5,360?mm). The El Camino's payload rating ranged from 650 to 1150 pounds, with gross vehicle weights ranging from 4400 to 4900 pounds depending on powertrain and suspension. The somewhat soft passenger car suspension of the base model left the vehicle level without a load, in contrast the Ranchero, where standard 1100-pound rated heavy duty rear springs gave it a distinct rake when empty. The quirky Level Air suspension option, in its second and final year, was listed as available, but was almost never seen on any Chevrolet model, much less an El Camino. The 1959 El Camino was promoted as the first Chevrolet pickup built with a steel bed floor instead of wood. The floor was a corrugated sheetmetal insert, secured with 26 recessed bolts. Concealed beneath it was the floor pan from the Brookwood two-door wagon, complete with foot wells. Box capacity was almost 33 cubic feet (0.93?m3).\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the performance engines offered were a 283-cid Turbo-jet V8 with two- or four-barrel carburetion, several Turbo-Thrust 348-cid V8s with four-barrel or triple two-barrel carburetors producing 335?bhp (250?kW; 340?PS), and 250- and 290-bhp 283-cube Ramjet Fuel Injection V8s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHot Rod magazine conducted a test of an El Camino equipped with the hottest powertrain combination available in early 1959a 315?bhp (235?kW; 319?PS), triple-carb, solid-lifter 348 V8 mated to a four-speed. Staff testers clocked 0-60?mph times of around seven seconds, estimated top speed at 130?mph (210?km/h), and predicted 14-second/100-mph quarter-mile performance with a rear-axle ratio suitable for drag racing installed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 22,246 El Caminos were produced for 1959. That bested the count of 21,706 first-year Rancheros made in 1957 and the 14,169 Ford sedan pickups built in direct competition for the 1959 model year. But 1960 would be a different story.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe similar but less flamboyant 1960 model started at $2366 for the six-cylinder model; another $107 for a V8 with the two-barrel 283. At first glance, the exterior once again had a Bel Air look, with that series' bright-metal \\"jet\\" appliqu and narrow trailing molding used to accent the rear quarters. Inside, Biscayne/Brookwood appointments also persisted.  The seat was now covered in striped-pattern cloth with vinyl facings. Available interior trim shades were once again gray, blue, and green. Floor coverings were in medium-tone vinyl. Mid-1959 powertrain availability was carried over with minimal changes for 1960: The base 283-cid V8 was detuned a bit for fuel economy and was now rated at 170?bhp (127?kW; 172?PS), and the fuel-injected engines were officially gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrders plummeted by a third, to just 14,163, at which point Chevrolet discontinued the model; meanwhile, Ford moved 21,027 Rancheros, which were now based on the brand-new Falcon compact. The pioneering American sedan pickups just did not connect with enough car-buying Americans. Perhaps these early \\"crossovers\\" didn't carry enough passengers; in a time when baby-boomer families dominated the market, three across was the best they could offer. Cargo volume was meager compared with pickup trucks.  The low-level trim and marketing efforts focused almost exclusively on commercial customers may have inhibited sales, as well.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n1964ÿ1967 Chevrolet Chevelle\\r\\n\\r\\nChevrolet reintroduced an all new, mid-size El Camino four years later based on the Chevrolet Chevelle. The 1964 model was similar to the Chevelle two-door wagon forward of the B-pillars and carried both \\"Chevelle\\" and \\"El Camino\\" badges, but Chevrolet marketed the vehicle as a utility model and Chevelle's most powerful engines were not available. Initial engine offerings included six-cylinder engines of 194 and 230 cubic inches with horsepower ratings of 120 and 155, respectively. The standard V8 was a 283 cubic-inch Chevrolet small block with two-barrel carburetor and 195 horsepower (145?kW) with optional engines including a 220-horsepower 283 with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts. Added to the El Camino's option list during the course of the 1964 model year were two versions of the 327 cubic-inch small block V8 rated at 250 and 300 horsepower (220?kW)the latter featuring a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1, larger four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts.[9] El Caminos also featured Air shocks in the rear,as well as fully boxed frames. The shocks were continued over all generations, the frames only thru 1967.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1965 El Camino received the same facelift as the '65 Chevelle, with a more pronounced V-shaped front end, and a higher performance L79 version of the 327 engine rated at 350?hp (261?kW) that was also available in Chevelles. Most of the other engines were carried over from 1964, including the 194 and 230 cubic-inch Turbo Thrift sixes, the 195-horsepower 283 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8 and 327 cubic-inch Turbo-Fire V8s of 250 and 300 horsepower (220?kW).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1966, GM added a 396?cu?in (6.5?L) V8 engine to the lineup rated from 325 to 375?hp (280?kW). The 1965 327 would run low 15s in the 1/4 mile (at some 90?mph), while 1966 to 1969 models were easily into the mid- to upper-14s. New sheetmetal highlighted the 1966 El Camino, identical to the Chevelle. A new instrument panel with horizontal sweep speedometer was featured. Inside, the standard version featured a bench seat interior and rubber floor mat from the low-line Chevelle 300 series, while the Custom used a more upscale interior from the Chevelle Malibu with plusher cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting, or optional Strato swivel bucket seats with console. A tachometer was optional.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1967 El Camino followed the Chevelle's styling facelift with a new grille, front bumper, and trim. Air shocks remained standard equipment on the El Camino, allowing the driver to compensate for a load. The year 1967 also brought the collapsible steering column and options of disc brakes and Turbo Hydramatic 400 3-speed automatic transmission. It was the second year the 396 (L35, L34, and L78) could be had in the El Camino (both 13480 300 Deluxe base and 13680 Malibu series). Since the L35 396/325?hp engine was the base for the SS396 series, the number of L35 engines reported sold by Chevrolet in 1967 (2,565) were sold in one of the two El Camino series, which were the only other series the engine could be ordered in. Since the L34 (now 350?hp) & L78 (375?hp) were available in either El Camino series as well as the two SS396 body styles, there is no way of knowing how many of these optional engines went to which body style. Chevrolet does report 17,176 L34 and 612 L78 engine options were sold in 1967 Chevelles, but there is no breakdown of body styles. The TH400 3-speed automatic was now available as an option (RPO M40) with the 396 engine in both the SS396 series and the 396-equipped El Caminos. The 3-speed manual transmission remained the standard transmission with a heavy duty (RPO M13) also available along with the 2-speed Powerglide and either M20 wide ratio or M21 close ratio 4-speed transmissions.  Although there was no actual factory El Camino Super Sport until 1968, many owners have \\"cloned\\" '67 SS396s using 1967 Chevelle SS396 badges and trim.\\r\\n\\r\\n1965 Chevrolet El Camino\\r\\n\\r\\nChevrolet introduced a longer El Camino in 1968, based on the Chevelle station wagon/four-door sedan wheelbase (116?in (2,946?mm), overall length: 208?in (5,283?mm)); it also shared Chevelle Malibu exterior and interior trims. The interior was revamped including cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl bench seats and deep twist carpeting. All-vinyl Strato bucket seats and center console were an $111 option. Power front disc brakes and Positraction were optional. A new, high-performance Super Sport SS396 version was launched. The Turbo-Jet 396 had 325?bhp (242?kW) or 350?bhp (260?kW) versions. Returning to the official options list for the first time since late 1966 was the 375?bhp (280?kW) L78. It had solid lifters, big-port heads, and an 800?cfm Holley four-barrel on a low-rise aluminum manifold. A three-speed manual was standard with all engines, and a four-speed or automatic was optional.\\r\\nIn 1968, the SS was a separate model (the \\"SS-396\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1969 models showed only minor changes, led by more-rounded front-end styling. A single chrome bar connected quad headlights, and a slotted bumper held the parking lights. New round instrument pods replaced the former linear layout. For the first time, the Chevrolet 350 V8 was used in an El Camino. The Super Sport group included a 265- or 325-horsepower 396-cubic-inch V8 beneath a double-domed hood, along with a black-out grille displaying an SS emblem. More potent editions of the 396 engine, developing 350 or 375 horsepower (280?kW) also made the options list. Options included power windows and locks. Curiously, back-up lights moved from the rear bumper to the tailgate, where they were ineffective when the gate was down.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1970 models received sheet metal revisions that gave the bodies a more squared-up stance, and interiors were also redesigned.\\r\\nThe new SS396, which actually displaced 402?cu?in (6.6?L) (although all emblems read 396) was available. Chevrolet's largest and most-powerful engine of the time was also put into a select few El Caminos. The LS6 454?CID engine, rated at 450?hp (336?kW) and 500?lb?ft (680?N?m) of torque, gave the El Camino 1/4-mile times in the lower 13-second range at around ?108?mph (174?km/h).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1971 El Camino got fresh front-end styling that included large Power-Beam single-unit headlights, a reworked grille and bumper, and integral park/signal/marker lights. For 1971, mandated lower-octane unleaded fuel necessitated a reduction in engine compression, and GM's A.I.R. system, a \\"smog pump\\", was added to control tailpipe emissions.  Power and performance were reduced. Engine offerings for 1971 included the 250-6, small-block V8s of 307 and 350 cubic inches; and big block V8s of 402 and 454-cubic-inch displacements. Horsepower ratings of those engines for 1971 ranged from 145 for the six to 365 for the RPO LS5 454 ÿ all in gross figures.  The LS6 454 V8 was gone forever.  A rebadged El Camino, the GMC Sprint debuted in 1971. It shared the same engine and transmission offerings as its Chevrolet counterpart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1972 El Caminos wore single-unit parking and side marker lights on their front fenders, outside of a revised twin-bar grille, but little changed. For 1972, horsepower measurements were switched to the \\"net\\" figures as installed in a vehicle with all accessories and emission controls hooked up. Engine offerings included the 110 horsepower (82?kW) 250-6, a 307 V8, a 175 horsepower (130?kW) 350-cubic-inch V8, and big block V8s of 402 and 454 cubic-inch displacements. The 402-cubic-inch (still known as a 396) produced 240 horsepower (180?kW); the 454 managed to put out 270 horsepower (200?kW) under the net rating system. Super Sport equipment could now be ordered with any V8 engine, including the base 307-cubic-inch version. All 1972 El Caminos with the 454 ci engine have a \\"W\\" as the fifth digit in the VIN, and the 454 was only available with Super Sport trim.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 1973, the El Camino was redesigned. Matching the Chevelle line and using the wagon chassis, it was the largest El Camino generation. Energy-absorbing hydraulic front bumper systems on these vehicles added more weight. There were two different trim levels of El Caminos during this period. The base model and SS option shared interior and exterior appointments with the Chevelle Malibu, while the El Camino Classic (introduced for 1974) shared its trim with the more upscale Chevelle Malibu Classic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chassis design was as new as the bodies with 1-inch (25?mm) a wider wheel track, front and rear. The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right, which resulted in a more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 El Caminos. Additional new features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass, flush-style outside door handles, molded full-foam seat construction, flow-through power ventilation system, inside hood release, refined Delcotron generator and sealed side-terminal battery, a larger 22-US-gallon (83?L; 18?imp?gal) fuel tank, and \\"flush and dry\\" rocker panels introduced first on the redesigned 1971 full-size Chevrolets. New options included swivel bucket seats (with console) and Turbine I urethane (backed by steel) wheels, as was the instrument gauge cluster.[13] A benefit of the new body designs was much better visibility of which the unusually thin windshield pillars contributed. A structural improvement was a stronger design for the side door guard beams.  El Caminos shared the \\"Colonnade\\" frameless door glass with other Chevelles, and would continue this feature into the next generation as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 307 2-barrel V8 of 115?hp (86?kW) was the base engine. Options included a 350 2-barrel V8 of 145?hp (108?kW), a 350 4-barrel V8 of 175?hp (130?kW), and a 454 4-barrel V8 rated at 245?hp (183?kW). Hardened engine valve seats and hydraulic camshafts made these engines reliable for many miles, and allowed them to accept the increasingly popular unleaded regular gasoline. The three-speed manual transmission was standard; 4-speed manual and Turbo Hydra-Matic 3-speed automatic transmissions were optional. Crossflow radiators and coolant reservoirs prevented overheating.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SS, then a trim option, included a black grill with SS emblem, bodyside striping, bright roof drip moldings, color-keyed dual sport mirrors, special front and rear stabilizer bars, rally wheels, 70-series raised white-lettered tires, special instrumentation and SS interior emblems.[14]\\r\\nThe SS option was available with a 350 or 454 V8 with the 4-speed or Turbo Hydra-Matic transmissions.\\r\\n[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1974 El Caminos sported an elongated, Mercedes-type grille. Inside, the new top-of-the-line El Camino Classic featured luxurious interiors with notchback bench seats (or optional Strato bucket seats) upholstered in cloth or vinyl, carpeted door panels and woodgrain instrument panel trim. The 350 V8 became the base engine and a 400 V8 engine was new this year. The 454, the top engine, was available with the Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 automatic or 4-speed manual transmission.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1975 models featured a new grill, providing a fresh appearance. Suspension upgrades offered a quieter ride, and radial-ply tires became standard. Dual remote mirrors, new twin sport mirrors, intermittent wipers, and cruise control were among new convenience features this year. The 1975 high energy ignition (HEI) provided spark to the spark plugs with minimal maintenance and increased power. The larger distributor cap also provided better high-RPM performance by decreasing the likelihood of the spark conducting to the wrong terminal. The 250-cubic-inch in-line six of 105?hp (78?kW) was offered as the base engine. The 454-cubic-inch V8, downrated yet again to 215 horsepower (160?kW), made it into 1975 as an El Camino option, but this would be its last go-around. It was not available in California, and the optional four-speed stick was no longer offered. Buyers could now choose an Econominder instrument package that included a vacuum gauge to point out when optimum fuel economy was being attained.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 1976, El Camino Classic models now featured the new rectangular headlights that other high-end GM cars were sporting. These were quad units in stacked arrangement. The base model retained the previously used dual round headlights. Engines included the base 250 I6 engine, a new 140-horsepower 305-cubic-inch V8, two- and four-barrel 350s (with availability still depending on California delivery), and the 400-cubic-inch V8, still good for 175?hp. All engines except the 250 I6 came with the Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmission as the only transmission available. The 250 I6 came with a 3-speed manual or an optional Turbo Hydra-matic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1977 models were little changed, except the 400 V8 was gone. The El Camino Classic was again the top model and the SS option continued.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1978 through 1987 El Caminos were produced in four trim levels: Classic, Black Knight (1978)/Royal Knight (1979ÿ83), Conquista and Super Sport, and shared chassis components with the Chevrolet Malibu. Chevrolet 90 V6 and Buick V6 engines were used for the first time. The optional 305 cubic-inch small block V8 was rated at 150 or 165 horsepower (123?kW), and from 1982ÿ1984, the Oldsmobile-sourced diesel engine was also optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new, trimmer El Camino was unveiled in 1978, adopting the new, more sharp-edged Malibu styling, and a one-inch longer wheelbase of 117?in (2,972?mm). The front end sheet metal and doors were shared with the Malibu, and the rear tailgate and bumper was shared with the Malibu station wagon. For the first time, though, the El Camino had a unique chassis ÿ it was shared with no other Chevrolet. The front end featured a new single rectangular headlight design. The base engine was a 200-cubic-inch (3.3-liter) V6 that developed 95 horsepower (71?kW), except in California where, to meet emissions standards, the 231-cubic-inch Buick engine was the base engine . Two upgrades could be ordered: a 305-cubic-inch V8 with 145 horsepower (108?kW), or a 350-cubic-inch V8 with 170 horsepower (130?kW) that was only available in El Caminos and Malibu station wagons. It was not available on Malibu passenger cars (with exception to coupe and sedan Malibu 9C1 police vehicles). Among GM makes, at least, the era of bigness was fading into history, overtaken by a new age of efficiency and economy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1979 model got minimal changes following its debut as a redesigned \\"new-size\\" model in 1978. Alterations to the 1979 El Camino amounting to little more than a new divided grille. However, a \\"small-block\\" 267-cubic-inch (4.4-liter) V8 joined the options list and slotted between the standard 3.3-liter V6 and the optional 5.0-liter four-barrel V8. The 350-cubic-inch (5.7-liter) V8, developing 170 horsepower (130?kW) was again available. Both three- and four-speed manual transmissions had floor shifters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1980 El Camino started out the 1980s with few changes, though engine choices were shuffled a little. The base V6 displaced 229 cubic inches, up from 200 the year before. Horsepower increased from 94 to 115. Optional again were a 267-cubic-inch V8 with 125 horsepower (93?kW) and a 305 V8, now with 155 horsepower (down five). The 350 with 170 horsepower (130?kW) offered in 1979 was dropped. A three speed floor shifted manual transmission was standard, but most got the optional three-speed automatic.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1981 models received a new horizontal tube grill. The 1981 engines mostly continued from 1980, but now used GM's Computer Command Control (CCC) emission system. The base 229-cubic-inch V6 made 110 horsepower (down from 115), as did the California-only 231-cubic-inch Buick V6. Optional engines were the 267-cubic-inch V8 with 115 horsepower (86?kW) and The 305-cubic-inch V8, now with 150 horsepower (110?kW). The three-speed automatic added a lock-up torque converter to aid highway mileage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1982 (through the final 1987) El Camino sported a new frontal appearance with a crosshatch grille flanked by quad rectangular headlights. New under the hood for 1982 was a 105-horsepower 5.7-liter (350-cubic-inch) Diesel V8, which was also offered in Chevrolet's full-size cars. Though mileage with the diesel was commendable, it was an expensive option and would eventually amass a dismal repair record. Gasoline-engine choices were unchanged, except Chevrolet's 229-cubic-inch (3.8-liter) V6 was now standard in California-bound cars, replacing Buick's 231-cubic-inch V6.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1983, the 4.4-liter V8 was gone, leaving the 5.0-liter version as the only optional gas V8. The standard engine was again Chevrolet's 3.8-liter V6 with 110 horsepower (82?kW), though California cars, once again, got a Buick V6 with similar specifications. Continuing on the options list was the 5.7-liter V8 Diesel with 105?hp (78?kW). The sister Malibu sedan and wagon were discontinued after the 1983 model year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1983ÿ87 El Camino SS was offered as a conversion (completed by Choo-Choo Customs Inc., of Chattanooga, Tennessee) to include the aerodynamic front end similar to the Monte Carlo SS, but did not receive the L69 engine package.\\r\\n\\r\\nGM shifted El Camino production to Mexico, and the new fuel-injected 4.3?L V6 became the base engine through 1987.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Camino production ended quietly in late 1987.[18] Some model year 1987's (420 El Caminos and 325 GMC Caballeros) are listed as new car retail deliveries in calendar year 1988 based on their date of first retail sale.[19] Speculation in online forums[20] indicates 3GCCW80H2HS915586 \\"may\\" be the final vehicle.\\r\\nThe GM Media Archive/Heritage Center confirmed that no MY 1988 El Caminos or Caballeros were produced.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA range of Chevrolet models, based on the Holden HK, was introduced onto the South African market in 1969.[22] A coupe utility version was released in 1971 under the Chevrolet El Camino name [22] and was offered with imported Holden 186 six and 308 V8 engines.[22] A version of the later Holden HQ utility was marketed in South Africa as the Chevrolet El Camino AQ.[23] [24]\\r\\nA facelifted El Camino AJ was released in 1976 with production ceasing in 1978.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1974, Chevrolet's sister division, Pontiac, reportedly took an El Camino body, grafted on the urethane-nose front end from its Grand Am series, added the GA's instrument panel, reclining Strato-bucket seats with adjustable lumbar support along with Pontiac's Rally II wheels. This was a styling exercise for a possible Pontiac version of the El Camino; the concept never reached production.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1992, GM unveiled an El Camino concept, basically a pickup variant of the Chevrolet Lumina Z34. The concept received mixed, mostly negative reviews, mostly because of its front wheel drive layout.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1995 model year, GM had a concept El Camino based on the full-size\\r\\nCaprice station wagon using the grille of a 1994ÿ96 Impala SS; this concept was destined for production, but was shelved when GM decided to discontinue the B-platform car line at the end of 1996.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pontiac G8 ST was shown at the New York International Auto Show in March 2008. Based on the Holden Commodore Ute, it shared the G8 platform with a 73-inch (1,900?mm) cargo bed. The Sport Truck had the same 361?hp (269?kW), 6.0-liter V8 used in the G8 GT, as well as the 3.6-liter, 300?hp (220?kW) direct-injection V6.[26] The G8 ST was slated for release as a 2010 model, but in January 2009, GM announced to dealers the G8 ST was cancelled due to budget cuts and restructuring.[27]  In 2011, GM again considered bringing back the El Camino under the Chevrolet brand as early as 2015.[28]","input":"What was the ford version of the el camino?"},{"output":"Lieutenant-General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, OM, GCMG, GCVO, KCB, DL","context":"Lieutenant-General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell, OM, GCMG, GCVO, KCB, DL (/?be?d?n ?po??l/ BAY-d?n POH-?l; 22 February 1857?ÿ 8 January 1941) was a British Army officer, writer, author of Scouting for Boys which was an inspiration for the Scout Movement, founder and first Chief Scout of The Boy Scouts Association and founder of the Girl Guides.[4]\\r\\nAfter having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa.[5] In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking.[6] Several of his military books, written for military reconnaissance and scout training in his African years, were also read by boys. In 1907, he held a demonstration camp, the Brownsea Island Scout camp, which is now seen as the beginning of Scouting.[7] Based on his earlier books, particularly Aids to Scouting, he wrote Scouting for Boys,[8] published in 1908 by Sir Arthur Pearson, for boy readership. In 1910 Baden-Powell retired from the army and formed The Boy Scouts Association.\\r\\nThe first Scout Rally was held at The Crystal Palace in 1909, at which appeared a number of girls dressed in Scout uniform, who told Baden-Powell that they were the \\"Girl Scouts\\", following which, in 1910, Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell formed the Girl Guides from which the Girl Guides Movement grew. In 1912 he married Olave St Clair Soames. He gave guidance to the Scouting and Girl Guiding Movements until retiring in 1937. Baden-Powell lived his last years in Nyeri, Kenya, where he died and was buried in 1941.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street (now 11 Stanhope Terrace), Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. He was called Stephe (pronounced \\"Stevie\\") by his family.[9] He was named after his godfather, Robert Stephenson, the railway and civil engineer,[10] and his third name was his mother's maiden name.[11]\\r\\nBaden-Powell was the son of The Reverend Baden Powell, Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford University and Church of England priest and his third wife, Henrietta Grace Smyth (3 September 1824?ÿ 13 October 1914), eldest daughter of Admiral William Henry Smyth. After Powell died in 1860, to identify her children with her late husband's fame, and to set her own children apart from their half-siblings and cousins, his mother styled the family name Baden-Powell. The name was eventually legally changed by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.[12]\\r\\nBaden-Powell had four older half-siblings from the second of his father's two previous marriages, and six full siblings Warington (1847ÿ1921), George (1847ÿ1898), the often-ill Augustus (\\"Gus\\") (1849ÿ1863), Francis (\\"Frank\\") (1850ÿ1933), Agnes (1858ÿ1945) and Baden (1860ÿ1937), as well as three others (Henrietta Smyth, 28 Oct 1851 ÿ 9 March 1854; John Penrose Smyth, 21 December 1852 ÿ 14 December 1855; and Jessie Smyth 25 November 1855 ÿ 24 July 1856),[13] who had all died very young before he was born.[9]\\r\\nBaden-Powell's father died when he was three. Subsequently, Baden-Powell was raised by his mother, a strong woman who was determined that her children would succeed. In 1933 he said of her \\"The whole secret of my getting on, lay with my mother.\\"[9][14][15]\\r\\nBaden-Powell attended Rose Hill School, Tunbridge Wells. He was given a scholarship to Charterhouse, a prestigious public school. He played the piano and violin, was an ambidextrous artist, and enjoyed acting. Holidays were spent on yachting or canoeing expeditions with his brothers. His first introduction to Scouting skills was through stalking and cooking game while avoiding teachers in the nearby woods, which were strictly out-of-bounds.[9]\\r\\nIn 1876 Baden-Powell joined the 13th Hussars in India with the rank of lieutenant. He enhanced and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was Mentioned in Despatches. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads. Although Baden-Powell claimed the beads had been those of the Zulu king Dinizulu, one researcher learned from Baden-Powell's diary that he had taken beads from a dead woman's body around that time[16] and indeed the bead form is more similar to dowry beads than to warrior beads. The beads were later incorporated into the Wood Badge training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and in 1890 he was brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth.[9] He was posted to Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence.[9] He frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings.[17] In 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.[18]\\r\\nBaden-Powell returned to Africa in 1896, and served in the Second Matabele War, in the expedition to relieve British South Africa Company personnel under siege in Bulawayo.[19] This was a formative experience for him not only because he commanded reconnaissance missions into enemy territory in the Matopos Hills, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here.[20] It was during this campaign that he first met and befriended the American scout Frederick Russell Burnham, who introduced Baden-Powell to stories of the American Old West and woodcraft (i.e. scoutcraft), and here that he wore his signature Stetson campaign hat and neckerchief for the first time.[9]\\r\\nBaden-Powell was accused of illegally executing a prisoner of war in 1896, the Matabele chief Uwini, who had been promised his life would be spared if he surrendered. Uwini was sentenced to be shot by firing squad by a military court, a sentence Baden-Powell confirmed. Baden-Powell was cleared by a military court of inquiry but the colonial civil authorities wanted a civil investigation and trial. Baden-Powell later claimed he was \\"released without a stain on my character\\". Baden-Powell was also accused of allowing native African warriors under his command to massacre enemy prisoners including women, children and non-combatants.[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter Rhodesia, Baden-Powell served in the Fourth Ashanti War in Gold Coast. In 1897, at the age of 40, he was brevetted colonel (the youngest colonel in the British Army) and given command of the 5th Dragoon Guards in India.[21] A few years later he wrote a small manual, entitled Aids to Scouting, a summary of lectures he had given on the subject of military scouting, much of it a written explanation of the lessons he had learned from Burnham, to help train recruits.[22] Using this and other methods he was able to train them to think independently, use their initiative, and survive in the wilderness.\\r\\nBaden-Powell returned to South Africa before the Second Boer War and was engaged in further military actions against the Zulus. Although instructed to maintain a mobile mounted force on the frontier with the Boer republics, Baden-Powell amassed stores and a garrison at Mafeking. While engaged in this, he and much of his intended mobile force was at Mafeking when it was surrounded by a Boer army, at times in excess of 8,000 men.\\r\\nBaden-Powell was the garrison commander during the subsequent Siege of Mafeking, which lasted 217 days. Although Baden-Powell could have destroyed his stores and had sufficient forces to break out throughout much of the siege, especially since the Boers lacked adequate artillery to shell the town or its forces, he remained in the town to the point of his intended mounted soldiers eating their horses.\\r\\nThe siege of the small town received undue attention from both the Boers and international media because Lord Edward Cecil, the son of the British Prime Minister, was besieged in the town.[23][24] The garrison held out until relieved, in part thanks to cunning deceptions, many devised by Baden-Powell. Fake minefields were planted and his soldiers pretended to avoid non-existent barbed wire while moving between trenches.[25] Baden-Powell did much reconnaissance work himself.[26] In one instance, noting that the Boers had not removed the rail line, Baden-Powell loaded an armoured locomotive with sharpshooters and sent it down the rails into the heart of the Boer encampment and back again in a successful attack.[24]\\r\\nContrary views of Baden-Powell's actions during the siege argue that his success in resisting the Boers was secured at the expense of the lives of the native African soldiers and civilians, including members of his own African garrison. Pakenham stated that Baden-Powell drastically reduced the rations to the native garrison.[27] However, in 2001, after subsequent research, Pakenham decidedly retreated from this position.[9][23]\\r\\nDuring the siege, the Mafeking Cadet Corps of white boys below fighting age stood guard, carried messages, assisted in hospitals, and so on, freeing grown men to fight. Baden-Powell did not form the Cadet Corps himself, and there is no evidence that he took much notice of them during the Siege. But he was sufficiently impressed with both their courage and the equanimity with which they performed their tasks to use them later as an object lesson in the first chapter of Scouting for Boys.\\r\\nThe siege was lifted on 16 May 1900. Baden-Powell was promoted to major-general, and became a national hero.[28] However, the British military commanders were more critical of his performance and even less impressed with his subsequent choices to again allow himself to be besieged.[24][27] Ultimately, his failure to properly scout the situation and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River led to his being removed from action.[23][24]\\r\\nBriefly back in the United Kingdom in October 1901, Baden-Powell was invited to visit King Edward VII at Balmoral, the monarch's Scottish retreat, and personally invested as Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).[29] The Order of the Bath is the fourth-most senior of the British Orders of Chivalry.\\r\\nBaden-Powell was further sidelined from active command[24] and given the role of organising the South African Constabulary, a colonial police force. He returned to England to take up a post as Inspector-General of Cavalry in 1903. While holding this position, Baden-Powell was instrumental in reforming reconnaissance training in British cavalry, giving the force an important advantage in scouting ability over continental rivals.[30] Also during this appointment, Baden-Powell selected the location of Catterick Garrison to replace Richmond Castle which was then the Headquarters of the Northumbrian Division. In 1907 he was promoted to Lieutenant-General but was left on the inactive list. Eventually he was appointed to the lowly command of the Northumbrian Division of the newly formed Territorial Force.[31]\\r\\nIn 1910, after being rebuked for a series of what were regarded as publicity gaffes, one suggesting invasion by Germany, Baden-Powell retired from the Army.[9] Baden-Powell later claimed[dubious ÿ discuss] he was advised by King Edward VII that he could better serve his country by promoting Scouting.[32][33]\\r\\nOn the outbreak of World War I in 1914, at the age of fifty-seven, Baden-Powell put himself at the disposal of the War Office. No command was given to him. It has been claimed[dubious ÿ discuss] that Lord Kitchener said: \\"he could lay his hand on several competent divisional generals but could find no one who could carry on the invaluable work of the Boy Scouts\\".[34] It was rumoured that Baden-Powell was engaged in spying and Baden-Powell claimed[dubious ÿ discuss] that intelligence officers spread this myth.[17]\\r\\nPronunciation of Baden-Powell\\r\\n/?be?d?n ?po?.?l/\\r\\nMan, Nation, Maiden\\r\\nPlease call it Baden.\\r\\nFurther, for Powell\\r\\nRhyme it with Noel\\r\\nVerse by B-P\\r\\nOn his return from Africa in 1903, Baden-Powell found that his military training manual, Aids to Scouting, had become a best-seller, and was being used by teachers and youth organisations.[35] Following his involvement in the Boys' Brigade as a Brigade Vice-President and Officer in charge of its scouting section, with encouragement from his friend, William Alexander Smith, Baden-Powell decided to re-write Aids to Scouting to suit a youth readership. In August 1907 he held a camp on Brownsea Island to test out his ideas. About twenty boys attended: eight from local Boys' Brigade companies, and about twelve public school boys, mostly sons of his friends.\\r\\nBaden-Powell was also influenced by Ernest Thompson Seton, who founded the Woodcraft Indians. Seton gave Baden-Powell a copy of his book The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians and they met in 1906.[36][37] The first book on the Scout Movement, Baden-Powell's Scouting for Boys was published in six instalments in 1908, and has sold approximately 150 million copies as the fourth best-selling book of the 20th century.[38]\\r\\nBoys and girls[39] spontaneously formed Scout troops and the Scouting Movement had inadvertently started, first as a national, and soon an international phenomenon.[40] A rally of Scouts was held at Crystal Palace in London in 1909, at which Baden-Powell met some of the first Girl Scouts. The Girl Guides were subsequently formed in 1910 under the auspices of Baden-Powell's sister, Agnes Baden-Powell. Baden-Powell's friend Juliette Gordon Low was encouraged by him to found the Girl Scouts of the USA.\\r\\nIn 1920, the 1st World Scout Jamboree took place in Olympia in West Kensington, and Baden-Powell was acclaimed Chief Scout of the World. Baden-Powell was created a Baronet in 1921 and Baron Baden-Powell, of Gilwell, in the County of Essex, on 17 September 1929, Gilwell Park being the International Scout Leader training centre.[41] After receiving this honour, Baden-Powell mostly styled himself \\"Baden-Powell of Gilwell\\".\\r\\nIn 1929, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree, he received as a present a new 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce car (chassis number GVO-40, registration OU 2938) and an Eccles Caravan.[42] This combination well served the Baden-Powells in their further travels around Europe. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles and is now on display at Gilwell Park. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Jam Roll and Eccles were reunited at Gilwell for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007. Recently it has been purchased on behalf of Scouting and is owned by a charity, B-P Jam Roll Ltd. Funds are being raised to repay the loan that was used to purchase the car.[42][43] Baden-Powell also had a positive impact on improvements in youth education.[44] Under his dedicated command the world Scouting movement grew. By 1922 there were more than a million Scouts in 32 countries; by 1939 the number of Scouts was in excess of 3.3?million.[45]\\r\\nAt the 5th World Scout Jamboree in 1937, Baden-Powell gave his farewell to Scouting, and retired from public Scouting life. 22 February, the joint birthday of Robert and Olave Baden-Powell, continues to be marked as Founder's Day by Scouts and Thinking Day by Guides to remember and celebrate the work of the Chief Scout and Chief Guide of the World.\\r\\nIn his final letter to the Scouts, Baden-Powell wrote:\\r\\nI have had a most happy life and I want each one of you to have a happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world to be happy and enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being successful in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. \\"Be prepared\\" in this way, to live happy and to die happy?ÿ stick to your Scout Promise always?ÿ even after you have ceased to be a boy?ÿ and God help you to do it.[46]\\r\\nIn January 1912, Baden-Powell was en route to New York on a Scouting World Tour, on the ocean liner SS?Arcadian, when he met Olave St Clair Soames.[47][48] She was 23, while he was 55; they shared the same birthday, 22 February. They became engaged in September of the same year, causing a media sensation due to Baden-Powell's fame. To avoid press intrusion, they married in private on 30 October 1912, at St Peter's Church in Parkstone.[49] The Scouts of England each donated a penny to buy Baden-Powell a wedding gift, a car (note that this is not the Rolls-Royce they were presented with in 1929). There is a monument to their marriage inside St Mary's Church, Brownsea Island.\\r\\nBaden-Powell and Olave lived in Pax Hill near Bentley, Hampshire from about 1919 until 1939.[50] The Bentley house was a gift of her father.[51] Directly after he had married, Baden-Powell began to suffer persistent headaches, which were considered by his doctor to be of psychosomatic origin and treated with dream analysis.[9] The headaches disappeared upon his moving into a makeshift bedroom set up on his balcony.\\r\\nIn 1939, Baden-Powell and Olave moved to a cottage he had commissioned in Nyeri, Kenya, near Mount Kenya, where he had previously been to recuperate. The small one-room house, which he named Paxtu, was located on the grounds of the Outspan Hotel, owned by Eric Sherbrooke Walker, Baden-Powell's first private secretary and one of the first Scout inspectors.[9] Walker also owned the Treetops Hotel, approximately 17?km out in the Aberdare Mountains, often visited by Baden-Powell and people of the Happy Valley set. The Paxtu cottage is integrated into the Outspan Hotel buildings and serves as a small Scouting museum.[52]\\r\\nBaden-Powell died on 8 January 1941 and is buried at St Peter's Cemetery in Nyeri.[53] His gravestone bears a circle with a dot in the centre \\"?\\", which is the trail sign for \\"Going home\\", or \\"I have gone home\\". His wife Olave moved back to England in 1942, although when she died (in 1977), her ashes were sent to Kenya and interred beside her husband.[54] The Kenyan government has declared Baden-Powell's grave a national monument.[55]\\r\\nIn addition, when Olave's sister Auriol Davidson (ne Soames) died in 1919, Olave and Robert took her three nieces, Christian (1912ÿ1975), Clare (1913ÿ1980), and Yvonne (1918ÿ1995?), into their family and brought them up as their own children.\\r\\nTim Jeal, who wrote the biography Baden-Powell, argued that Baden-Powell's distrust of communism led to his implicit support, through na?vet, of fascism. Baden-Powell admired Benito Mussolini early[when?] in the Italian fascist leader's career. In 1939 Baden-Powell noted in his diary: \\"Lay up all day. Read Mein Kampf. A wonderful book, with good ideas on education, health, propaganda, organisation etc. ÿ and ideals which Hitler does not practise himself.\\"[9]:550\\r\\nSome early Scouting \\"Thanks\\" badges (from 1911) and the Scouting \\"Medal of Merit\\" badge had a swastika symbol on them.[59][60] This was undoubtedly influenced by the use by Rudyard Kipling of the swastika on the jacket of his published books,[61] including \\"Kim\\", which was used by Baden-Powell as a basis for the Wolf Cub branch of the Scouting Movement. The swastika had been a symbol for luck in India long before being adopted by the National Socialist Party in 1920, and when Nazi use of the swastika became more widespread, the Scouts stopped using it. According to a biography by Michael Rosenthal, Baden-Powell used the swastika because he was a Nazi sympathiser. By contrast, Jeal argues that Baden-Powell had been ignorant of the symbol's growing association with Nazism and that he had used the symbol for its centuries-old meaning of \\"good luck\\" in India. (Nazi Germany banned Scouting, a competitor to the Hitler Youth, in June 1934, seeing it as \\"a haven for young men opposed to the new State\\".[62] Based on the regime's view of Scouting as a dangerous espionage organisation, Baden-Powell's name was included in \\"The Black Book\\", a 1940 list of people slated for detention following the planned conquest of the United Kingdom.[63])\\r\\nThree of Baden-Powell's many biographers comment on his sexuality; the first two (in 1979 and 1986) focused on his relationship with his close friend Kenneth McLaren.[64]:217ÿ218[65]:48 Tim Jeal's later biography discusses the relationship and finds no evidence that this friendship was of an erotic nature.[9]:82 Jeal then examines Baden-Powell's views on women, his appreciation of the male form, his military relationships, and his marriage, concluding that, in his personal opinion, Baden-Powell was a repressed homosexual.[9]:103 Jeal's conclusion is disputed.[66]:6\\r\\nBaden-Powell published books and other texts during his years of military service both to finance his life and to generally educate his men.[9]\\r\\nBaden-Powell was regarded as an excellent storyteller. During his whole life he told \\"ripping yarns\\" to audiences. After having published Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell kept on writing more handbooks and educative materials for all Scouts, as well as directives for Scout Leaders. In his later years, he also wrote about the Scout movement and his ideas for its future. He spent most of the last two years of his life in Africa, and many of his later books had African themes.[9] Currently, many pages of his field diary, complete with drawings, are on display at the National Scouting Museum in Irving, Texas.\\r\\nBaden-Powell made paintings and drawings almost every day of his life. Most have a humorous or informative character.[9] Baden-Powell was a consummate artist, and his books are scattered with his pen-and-ink sketches, frequently whimsical. Unfortunately, there is no catalogue of his paintings, some of which appear in some of his books, and twelve hang in the British Scout Headquarters at Gilwell Park.\\r\\nIn 1937 Baden-Powell was appointed to the Order of Merit, one of the most exclusive awards in the British honours system, and he was also awarded 28 decorations by foreign states, including the Grand Officer of the Portuguese Order of Christ,[73] the Grand Commander of the Greek Order of the Redeemer (1920),[74] the Commander of the French Lgion d'honneur (1925), the First Class of the Hungarian Order of Merit (1929), the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog of Denmark, the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Lion, the Grand Cross of the Order of the Phoenix, and the Order of Polonia Restituta.\\r\\nThe Silver Wolf Award worn by Robert Baden-Powell is handed down the line of his successors, with the current Chief Scout, Bear Grylls, wearing this original award.\\r\\nThe Bronze Wolf Award, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded by the World Scout Committee for exceptional services to world Scouting, was first awarded to Baden-Powell by a unanimous decision of the then International Committee on the day of the institution of the Bronze Wolf in Stockholm in 1935. He was also the first recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926, the highest award conferred by the Boy Scouts of America.\\r\\nIn 1927, at the Swedish National Jamboree he was awarded by the ?sterreichischer Pfadfinderbund with the \\"Gro?es Dankabzeichen des ?PB.[75]:113\\r\\nIn 1931 Baden-Powell received the highest award of the First Austrian Republic (Gro?es Ehrenzeichen der Republik am Bande) out of the hands of President Wilhelm Miklas.[75]:101 Baden-Powell was also one of the first and few recipients of the Goldene Gemse, the highest award conferred by the ?sterreichischer Pfadfinderbund.[76]\\r\\nIn 1931, Major Frederick Russell Burnham dedicated Mount Baden-Powell[77] in California to his old Scouting friend from forty years before.[78][79] Today their friendship is honoured in perpetuity with the dedication of the adjoining peak, Mount Burnham.[80]\\r\\nBaden-Powell was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize on numerous occasions, including 10 separate nominations in 1928.[81] He was awarded the Wateler Peace Prize in 1937.[82] In 2002, Baden-Powell was named 13th in the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.[83] As part of the Scouting 2007 Centenary, Nepal renamed Urkema Peak to Baden-Powell Peak.[84]\\r\\nThe family name legally changed from Powell to Baden-Powell by Royal Licence on 30 April 1902.[41]","input":"Who was the founder of the scout movement?"},{"output":"October 29, 1821","context":"The first natives in Costa Rica were hunters and gatherers, and Costa Rica served as an \\"Intermediate Region\\" between Mesoamerican and Andean native cultures.\\r\\nIn 1502, Christopher Columbus made landfall in Costa Rica. Soon after, his forces overcame the indigenous people. He incorporated the territory into the Captaincy General of Guatemala as a province of New Spain in 1524. For the next 300 years, Costa Rica was a colony of Spain. As a result, Costa Rica's culture has been greatly influenced by the culture of Spain.[1] During this period, Costa Rica remained sparsely developed and impoverished.\\r\\nFollowing the Mexican War of Independence (1810ÿ1821), Costa Rica became part of the independent Mexican Empire in 1821. Subsequently, Costa Rica was part of the Federal Republic of Central America in 1823, before gaining full independence in 1838. Its economy struggled due to lack of connections with European suppliers. In 1856, Costa Rica resisted American settlers from mounting a take-over of the government.\\r\\nAfter 1869, Costa Rica established a democratic government.[1]\\r\\nAfter the Costa Rican Civil War in 1948, the government drafted a new constitution, guaranteeing universal suffrage and the dismantling of the military. Today, Costa Rica is a democracy that relies on technology and eco-tourism for its economy. Although poverty has declined since the turn of the 21st century, economic problems still exist. Costa Rica is facing problems of underemployment, foreign and internal debt, and a trade deficiency.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Pre-Columbian times, the Native Americans in what is now Costa Rica were part of a cultural complex known as the \\"Intermediate Area,\\" between the Mesoamerican and Andean cultural regions.[2]\\r\\nThe northwest of the country, the Nicoya Peninsula, was the southernmost point of Nahuatl cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors (conquistadores) came in the sixteenth century. The central and southern portions of the country had Chibcha influences. The indigenous people have influenced modern Costa Rican culture to a relatively small degree. In the years soon after European encounter, many of the people died due to infectious diseases, such as measles and smallpox, which were endemic among the Europeans but to which they had no immunity.[3]\\r\\nThe oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica is associated with the arrival of groups of hunter-gatherers about 10,000 to 7,000 years BC, with ancient archaeological evidence (stone tool making) located in the Turrialba Valley, at sites called Guardiria and Florence, with matching quarry and workshop areas with presence of type clovis spearheads and South American inspired arrows. All this suggests the possibility that in this area two different cultures coexisted.\\r\\nThe people of this era were nomadic. They were organized in family-based bands of about 20 to 30 members. Their usual prey animals were called megafauna, such as giant armadillos and sloths, mastodons, etc. These became extinct about 8,000 years before the modern era. The first settlers had to adapt to hunting smaller animals and develop appropriate strategies to adjust to the new conditions.\\r\\nThe colonial period began when Christopher Columbus reached the eastern coast of Costa Rica on his fourth voyage on September 18, 1502. Numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions followed, eventually leading to the first Spanish colony in Costa Rica, Villa Bruselas founded in 1524.[4]\\r\\nDuring most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, which was nominally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (i.e., Mexico). In practice it operated as a largely autonomous entity within the Spanish Empire. Costa Rica's distance from the capital in Guatemala, its legal prohibition under Spanish law against trading with its southern neighbors in Panama, then part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada (i.e., Colombia), and the lack of resources such as gold and silver, resulted in Costa Rica attracting few inhabitants. It was a poor, isolated, and sparsely inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.[5] a Spanish governor in 1719 described Costa Rica as \\"the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America.\\" [6]\\r\\nThe area suffered a lack of indigenous population available for forced labor, which meant that most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work their own land. This prevented the establishment of large haciendas. For all these reasons Costa Rica was by and large unappreciated and overlooked by the Spanish Crown and left to develop on its own. The small landowners' relative poverty, the lack of a large indigenous labor force, the population's ethnic and linguistic homogeneity, and Costa Rica's isolation from the Spanish colonial centers in Mexico and the Andes, all contributed to the development of an autonomous and individualistic agrarian society. Even the Governor had to farm his own crops and tend to his own garden due to his poverty.[7][disputed ÿ discuss]\\r\\nIn the early 19th century, Napoleon's occupation of Spain led to the outbreak of revolts all across Spanish America. In New Spain, all of the fighting by those seeking independence was done in the center of that area from 1810 to 1821, what today is central Mexico. Once the Viceroy was defeated in the capital citytoday Mexico Cityin 1821, the news of independence was sent to all the territories of New Spain, including the Intendencies of the former Captaincy of Guatemala. Costa Rica joined the other Central American Intendancies in a joint declaration of independence from Spain, the 1821 Act of Independence.\\r\\nOn October 13, 1821 the documents arrived at Cartago, and an emergency meeting was called upon by Governor Juan Manuel de Ca?as. There were many ideas on what to do upon gaining independence, such as joining Mexico, joining Guatemala or Nueva Granada (today Colombia). A group was declared (Junta de Legados), which created the temporary Junta Gubernativa Superior. Meanwhile, \\"the clouds clear up\\" (\\"Mientras se aclaraban los nublados del da\\"), was a famous phrase of the events of the day.\\r\\nIndependence from Spain was acknowledged and ratified on October 29, 1821 by the colonial authorities. It was then ratified in the cities of San Jos on November 1, 1821, at Cartago on November 3rd, 1821, at Heredia on November 11, 1821, and Alajuela on November 25th, 1821.[8]\\r\\nAfter the declaration of independence, the New Spain parliament intended to establish a commonwealth whereby the King of Spain, Ferdinand VII, would also be Emperor of New Spain, but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the New Spain throne. Ferdinand VII did not recognize the colony's independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of New Spain.\\r\\nBy request of Parliament, the president of the regency, Agustn de Iturbide, was proclaimed emperor of New Spain, which was renamed as Mexico. The Mexican Empire was the official name given to this monarchical regime from 1821 to 1823. The territory of the Mexican Empire included the continental intendancies and provinces of New Spain proper (including those of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala) (See: History of Central America).\\r\\nIn 1823, a revolution in Mexico ousted Emperor Agustn de Iturbide. A new Mexican congress voted to allow the Central American Intendancies to decide their own fate. That year, the United Provinces of Central America was formed of the five Central American Intendancies under General Manuel Jos Arce. The Intendancies took the new name of States. The United Provinces federation, not strongly united to begin with, rapidly disintegrated under the pressures of intra-provincial rivalries.\\r\\nFollowing full independence in 1838, Costa Rica had no regular trade routes established to export their coffee to European markets. They had problems with lack of infrastructure producing problems in transportation: the coffee-growing areas were mainly in the Central Valley and had access only to the port of Puntarenas on the Pacific Coast. Before the Panama Canal was opened, ships from Europe had to sail around Cape Horn in order to get to the Pacific Coast. In 1843, the country established a trade route to Europe with the help of William Le Lacheur, a Guernsey merchant and shipowner.\\r\\nIn 1856, William Walker, an American filibuster, began incursions into Central America. After landing in Nicaragua, he proclaimed himself as president of Nicaragua and re-instated slavery, which had been abolished.[9] He intended to expand into Costa Rica and after he entered that territory, the country declared war against his forces. Led by Commander in Chief of the Army of Costa Rica, President Juan Rafael Mora Porras, the filibusters were defeated and forced out of the country. Costa Rican forces followed the filibusters into Rivas, Nicaragua, where in a final battle, William Walker and his forces were finally pushed back. Juan Santamara, a drummer boy from Alajuela who lost his life torching the filibusters' stronghold, was killed in this final battle. He is today remembered as a national hero.[10]\\r\\nAn era of peaceful democracy in Costa Rica began in 1869 with elections. Costa Rica has avoided much of the violence that has plagued Central America. Since the late nineteenth century, only two brief periods of violence have marred its democratic development. In 1917ÿ19, Federico Tinoco Granados ruled as a dictator.\\r\\nIn 1948, Jos Figueres Ferrer led an armed uprising in the wake of a disputed presidential election. \\"With more than 2,000 dead, the 44-day Costa Rican Civil War resulting from this uprising was the bloodiest event in twentieth-century Costa Rican history.\\"[11] The victorious junta drafted a constitution guaranteeing free elections with universal suffrage and the abolition of the military. Figueres became a national hero, winning the first election under the new constitution in 1953. Since then Costa Rica has been one of the few democracies to operate without a standing army.[12] The nation has held 16 successive presidential elections, all peaceful, the latest being in 2014.\\r\\nCosta Rica's economy went under a transformation in 1978. The country went from being \\"an economic development success story\\" to entering a severe socio-economic crisis. Costa Rica relied on the exportation of bananas and coffee. In 1978, coffee prices dropped, and its revenues declined. In 1979, the price of oil, a main imported item, increased sharply and rapidly, plunging the country into crisis. In order to help improve the economy, President Rodrigo Carazo continued to borrow money internationally. In return, this led the country to be more in debt.[13]\\r\\nOnce a largely agricultural country, Costa Rica has transformed to relying on technology industry and services, and eco-tourism. Costa Rica's major source of export income is technology based. Microsoft, Motorola, Intel and other technology-related firms have established operations in Costa Rica. Local companies create and export software as well as other computer-related products. Tourism is growing at an accelerated pace, and many believe that income from this tourism may soon become the major contributor to the nation's GDP. Traditional agriculture, particularly coffee and bananas, continues to be an important part of Costa Rica's exports.\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"When did costa rica gain independence from spain?"},{"output":"around 1280 CE","context":"","input":"When did the polynesians first arrived in new zealand?"},{"output":"Honorius","context":"In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing de facto independent entities; however, at no point did the Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.\\r\\nThe Western Roman Empire existed intermittently in several periods between the 3rd and 5th centuries, after Diocletian's Tetrarchy and the reunifications associated with Constantine the Great and Julian the Apostate (331/2ÿ363). Theodosius I divided the Empire upon his death (in 395) between his two sons. Finally, eighty-five years later, Zeno of the Eastern Empire recognized the reality of the Western Empire's reduced domainRoman power ceased to exist even in the Italian Peninsulaafter the deposition of Romulus Augustus and the subsequent death of Julius Nepos, and therefore proclaimed himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.\\r\\nThe rise of Odoacer of the Foederati to rule over Italy in 476 was popularized by eighteenth-century historian Edward Gibbon as a demarcating event for the end of the Western Empire and is sometimes used to mark the transition from Antiquity to the Middle Ages. Imperial rule was reimposed in large parts of the West in the sixth century by the armies of the Eastern Roman Empire but political upheaval in the East Roman heartlands saw the Western provinces slip away once more, this time for good. Frankish king Charlemagne would be declared in AD 800 in an attempt to revive the Western Roman Empire; this new imperial line would evolve in time into the Holy Roman Empire, which revived the imperial title but was otherwise in no meaningful sense an extension of Roman traditions or institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the Roman Republic expanded, it reached a point where the central government in Rome could not effectively rule the distant provinces. Communications and transportation were especially problematic given the vast extent of the Empire. News of invasion, revolt, natural disasters, or epidemic outbreak was carried by ship or mounted postal service, often requiring much time to reach Rome and for Rome's orders to be realized in the province of origin. For this reason, provincial governors had de facto rule in the name of the Roman Republic.\\r\\nPrior to the establishment of the Empire, the territories of the Roman Republic had been divided in 43 BC among the members of the Second Triumvirate: Mark Antony, Octavian and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. Antony received the provinces in the East: Achaea, Macedonia and Epirus (roughly modern Greece, Albania and the coast of Croatia), Bithynia, Pontus and Asia (roughly modern Turkey), Syria, Cyprus, and Cyrenaica. These lands had previously been conquered by Alexander the Great; thus, much of the aristocracy was of Greek origin. The whole region, especially the major cities, had been largely assimilated into Greek culture, Greek often serving as the lingua franca.\\r\\nOctavian obtained the Roman provinces of the West: Italia (modern Italy), Gaul (modern France), Gallia Belgica (parts of modern Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg), and Hispania (modern Spain and Portugal). These lands also included Greek and Carthaginian colonies in the coastal areas, though Celtic tribes such as Gauls and Celtiberians were culturally dominant. Lepidus received the minor province of Africa (roughly modern Tunisia). Octavian soon took Africa from Lepidus, while adding Sicilia (modern Sicily) to his holdings.\\r\\nUpon the defeat of Mark Antony, a victorious Octavian controlled a united Roman Empire. While the Roman Empire featured many distinct cultures, all were often said to experience gradual Romanization. While the predominantly Greek culture of the East and the predominantly Latin culture of the West functioned effectively as an integrated whole, political and military developments would ultimately realign the Empire along those cultural and linguistic lines.\\r\\nMinor rebellions and uprisings were fairly common events throughout the Empire. Conquered tribes or cities would revolt, and the legions would be detached to crush the rebellion. While this process was simple in peacetime, it could be considerably more complicated in wartime, as for example in the Great Jewish Revolt.\\r\\nIn a full-blown military campaign, the legions, under generals such as Vespasian, were far more numerous. To ensure a commander's loyalty, a pragmatic emperor might hold some members of the general's family hostage. To this end, Nero effectively held Domitian and Quintus Petillius Cerialis, governor of Ostia, who were respectively the younger son and brother-in-law of Vespasian. The rule of Nero ended only with the revolt of the Praetorian Guard, who had been bribed in the name of Galba. The Praetorian Guard, a figurative \\"sword of Damocles\\", were often perceived as being of dubious loyalty. Following their example, the legions at the borders increased participation in the civil wars.\\r\\nThe main enemy in the West was arguably the Germanic tribes behind the rivers Rhine and Danube. Augustus had tried to conquer them but ultimately pulled back after the Teutoburg reversal.\\r\\nThe Parthian Empire, in the East, on the other hand, was too remote and powerful to be conquered. Any Parthian invasion was confronted and usually defeated; similarly, Parthians repelled some attempts of Roman invasion, however, even after successful wars of conquest, such as those implemented by Trajan and Septimius Severus. Those distant territories were forsaken to prevent unrest and also to ensure a more healthy and lasting peace with the Persians. The Parthians were followed by the Sasanian Empire, which continued hostilities with the Roman Empire.\\r\\nControlling the western border of Rome was reasonably easy because it was relatively close and also because of the disunity between the Germanic foes, however, controlling both frontiers altogether during wartime was difficult. If the emperor was near the border in the East, chances were high that an ambitious general would rebel in the West and vice versa. This wartime opportunism plagued many ruling emperors and indeed paved the road to power for several future emperors.\\r\\nRome and the Italian peninsula began to experience an economic slowdown as industries and money began to move outward. By the beginning of the 2nd century AD, the economic stagnation of Italia was seen in the provincial-born Emperors, such as Trajan and Hadrian. Economic problems increased in strength and frequency.[citation needed]\\r\\nStarting on 18 March 235, with the assassination of the Emperor Alexander Severus, the Roman Empire sank into a 50-year civil war, now known as the Crisis of the Third Century. The rise of the bellicose Sassanid dynasty in Parthia posed a major threat to Rome in the east. Demonstrating the increased danger, Emperor Valerian was captured by Shapur I in 259. His eldest son and heir-apparent, Gallienus, succeeded and took up the fight on the eastern frontier. Gallienus' son, Saloninus, and the Praetorian Prefect Silvanus were residing in Colonia Agrippina (modern Cologne) to solidify the loyalty of the local legions. Nevertheless, Marcus Cassianius Latinius Postumus - the local governor of the German provinces? rebelled; his assault on Colonia Agrippina resulted in the deaths of Saloninus and the prefect. In the confusion that followed, an independent state known as the Gallic Empire emerged.\\r\\nIts capital was Augusta Treverorum (modern Trier), and it quickly expanded its control over the German and Gaulish provinces and over all of Hispania and Britannia. It had its own senate, and a partial list of its consuls still survives. It maintained Roman religion, language, and culture, and was far more concerned with fighting the Germanic tribes than other Romans. However, in the reign of Claudius Gothicus (268 to 270), large expanses of the Gallic Empire were restored to Roman rule. At roughly the same time, several eastern provinces seceded under the Palmyrene Empire, under the rule of Queen Zenobia.\\r\\nIn 272, Emperor Aurelian finally managed to reclaim Palmyra and its territory for the empire. With the East secure, his attention was turned to the West, taking the Gallic Empire a year later. Because of a secret deal between Aurelian and Gallic Emperor Tetricus I and his son Tetricus II, the Gallic army was swiftly defeated. In exchange, Aurelian spared their lives and gave the two former rebels important positions in Italy.\\r\\nThe external borders were mostly stable for the remainder of the Crisis of the Third Century, although, between the death of Aurelian in 275 and the accession of Diocletian ten years later, at least eight emperors or would-be emperors were killed, many assassinated by their own troops.\\r\\nUnder Diocletian, the political division of the Roman Empire began. In 285, he promoted Maximian to the rank of Augustus (Emperor) and gave him control of the Western regions of the Empire. In 293, Galerius and Constantius Chlorus were appointed as their subordinates (Caesars), creating the First Tetrarchy. This system effectively divided the Empire into four major regions and created separate capitals besides Rome as a way to avoid the civil unrest that had marked the 3rd century. In the West, the capitals were Maximian's Mediolanum (now Milan) and Constantius' Trier. In the East, the capitals were Sirmium and Nicomedia. On 1 May 305, the two senior Augusti stepped down, and their respective Caesars were promoted to Augusti and appointed two new Caesars, thus creating the Second Tetrarchy.\\r\\nThe system of the Tetrarchy quickly ran aground when the Western Roman Empire's Constantius died unexpectedly in 306, and his son Constantine the Great was proclaimed Augustus of the West by the legions in Britain. A crisis followed as several claimants attempted to rule the Western half. In 308, the Augustus of the East, Galerius, arranged a conference at Carnuntum which revived the Tetrarchy by dividing the West between Constantine and a newcomer named Licinius. Constantine was far more interested in conquering the whole empire. Through a series of battles in the East and the West, Licinius and Constantine stabilized their respective parts of the Roman Empire by 314, and began to compete for sole control of a reunified state. Constantine emerged victorious in 324 after the surrender and murder of Licinius following the Battle of Chrysopolis.\\r\\nThe Tetrarchy ended, but the idea of dividing the Roman Empire between two emperors had been validated. Very strong emperors would reunite it under their single rule, but with their death the Roman Empire would be divided again and again between the East and the West.\\r\\nConstantius was born in 317 at Sirmium, Pannonia. He was the third son of Constantine the Great, and second by his second wife Fausta, the daughter of Maximian. Constantius was made Caesar by his father on 13 November 324.[2] The Roman Empire was under the rule of a single Emperor, but, with the death of Constantine in 337, civil war erupted among his three sons, dividing the Empire into three parts. The West was unified in 340 under Constans, who was assassinated in 350 under the order of the usurper Magnentius; after Magnentius lost the Battle of Mursa Major and committed suicide, a complete reunification of the whole Empire occurred in 353, with Constantius II.\\r\\nConstantius II focused most of his power in the East and is regarded as the first emperor of the Byzantine Empire. Under his rule, the city of Byzantium - only recently re-founded as Constantinople - was fully developed as a capital. In 361, Constantius II became ill and died, and Constantius Chlorus' grandson Julian, who had served as Constantius II's Caesar, assumed power. Julian was killed in 363 in the Battle of Samarra against the Persian Empire and was succeeded by Jovian, who ruled only until 364.\\r\\nFollowing the death of Jovian, Valentinian I emerged as Emperor in 364. He immediately divided the Empire once again, giving the eastern half to his brother Valens. Stability was not achieved for long in either half, as the conflicts with outside forces (tribes) intensified. In 376, the Visigoths, fleeing before the Ostrogoths, who in turn were fleeing before the Huns, were allowed to cross the river Danube and settle into the Balkans by the Eastern government. Mistreatment caused a full-scale rebellion, and in 378 they inflicted a crippling defeat on the Eastern Roman field army in the Battle of Adrianople, in which Valens also died. The campaigns to subdue them were only partly successful, and they officially became semi-independent foederati under their own leaders.\\r\\nMore than in the East, there was also opposition to the Christianizing policy of the Emperors in the western half of the Empire. In 379, Valentinian I's son and successor Gratian declined to wear the mantle of Pontifex Maximus, and in 382 he rescinded the rights of pagan priests and removed the Altar of Victory from the Roman Curia, a decision which caused dissatisfaction among the traditionally pagan aristocracy of Rome. Theodosius I later decreed a ban on all religions except orthodox Christianity.\\r\\nThe political situation was unstable. In 383, a powerful and popular general named Magnus Maximus seized power in the West and forced Gratian's half-brother Valentinian II to flee to the East for aid; in a destructive civil war, the Eastern Emperor Theodosius I restored him to power. In 392, the Frankish and pagan magister militum Arbogast assassinated Valentinian II and proclaimed an obscure senator named Eugenius as Emperor. In 394 the forces of the two halves of the Empire again clashed with great loss of life. Again Theodosius I won, and he briefly ruled a united Empire until his death in 395. He was the last Emperor to rule both parts of the Roman Empire; his older son Arcadius inherited the eastern half while the younger Honorius got the western half. Both were still minors and neither was capable of ruling effectively. Honorius was placed under the tutelage of the half-Roman/half-barbarian magister militum Flavius Stilicho while Rufinus became the power behind the throne in the east. Rufinus and Stilicho were rivals, and their disagreements were exploited by the Gothic leader Alaric I who again rebelled following the death of Theodosius I. Neither half of the Empire could raise forces sufficient even to subdue Alaric's men, and both tried to use Alaric against the other half. Alaric himself tried to establish a long-term territorial and official base, but was never able to do so.\\r\\nStilicho tried to defend Italy and bring the invading Goths under control, but to do so he stripped the Rhine frontier of troops and the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi invaded Gaul in large numbers. Stilicho became a victim of court intrigues and was killed in 408. While the East began a slow recovery and consolidation, the West began to collapse entirely. Alaric's men sacked Rome in 410.\\r\\nThe West, less urbanized with a spread-out populace, may have experienced an economic decline throughout the Late Empire in some provinces. Southern Italy, northern Gaul (except for large towns and cities) to some extent Spain and the Danubian areas may have suffered. The East was not so destitute, especially as Emperors like Constantine the Great and Constantius II had invested heavily in the eastern economy. As a result, the Eastern Empire could afford large numbers of professional soldiers and augment them with mercenaries, while the Western Roman Empire could not afford this to the same extent. Even in major defeats, the East could, certainly not without difficulties, buy off its enemies with a ransom.\\r\\nThe political, economic and military control of the Eastern Empire's resources remained safe in Constantinople, which was well fortified and located at the crossroads of several major trade and military routes. In contrast, the Western Empire was more fragmented. Its capital was transferred to Ravenna in 402 largely for defensive reasons, and it had easy access to the imperial fleet of the Eastern Empire but was isolated in other aspects as it was surrounded by swamps and marshes. The economic power remained focused on Rome and its hyper-rich senatorial aristocracy which dominated much of Italy and Africa in particular. After Gallienus banned senators from army commands in the mid-3rd century, the senatorial elite lost all experience ofand interest inmilitary life. In the early 5th century the wealthy landowning elite of the Roman Senate largely barred its tenants from military service, but it also refused to approve sufficient funding for maintaining a sufficiently powerful mercenary army to defend the entire Western Empire. The West's most important military area had been northern Gaul and the Rhine frontier in the 4th century, when Trier frequently served as the capital of the Empire and many leading Western generals were Barbarians. After the civil war in 394 between Theodosius I and Eugenius, the new Western government installed by Theodosius I increasingly had to divert military resources from Britain and the Rhine to protect Italy. This, in turn, led to further rebellions and civil wars because the Western imperial government was not providing the military protection the northern provinces expected and needed against the barbarians.\\r\\nThe Western Empire's resources were much limited, and the lack of available manpower forced the government to rely ever more on confederate barbarian troops operating under their own commanders, where the Western Empire would often have difficulties paying. In certain cases deals were struck with the leaders of barbaric mercenaries rewarding them with land, which led to the Empire's decline as less land meant there would be less tax revenue to support the military.\\r\\nAs the central power weakened, the State gradually lost control of its borders and provinces, as well as control over the Mediterranean Sea. Roman Emperors tried to maintain control of the sea, but, once the Vandals conquered North Africa, imperial authorities had to cover too much ground with too few resources. The loss of the African provinces might have been the worse reversal on the West's fortunes, since they were among its wealthiest territories and supplied the essential grain imports to Italy. In many places, the Roman institutions collapsed along with the economic stability. In some regions, such as Gaul and Italy, the settlement of barbarians on former Roman lands seems to have caused relatively little disruption.\\r\\nRemaining as emperor after the death of Stilicho in 408, Honorius reigned until his own death in 423. His reign was filled with usurpations and invasions. In 410, Rome was sacked by Alaric's forces. This event made a great impression on contemporaries, as this was the first time since the Gallic invasions of the 4th century BC that the city had fallen to a foreign enemy. Under Alaric's successors, the Goths then settled in Gaul (412ÿ418), from where they operated as Roman allies against the Vandals, Alans, and Suevi in Spain, and against the usurper Jovinus (413). Meanwhile, another usurper, Constantine (406ÿ411), had stripped Roman Britain of its defenses when he crossed over to Gaul in 407, leaving the Romanized population subject to invasions, first by the Picts and then by the Saxons, Angli, and the Jutes who began to settle permanently from about 440 onwards.\\r\\nHonorius' death in 423 was followed by turmoil until the Eastern Roman government with the force of arms installed Valentinian III as Western Emperor in Ravenna, with Galla Placidia acting as regent during her son's minority. After a violent struggle with several rivals, and against Placidia's wish, Aetius rose to the rank of magister militum. Aetius was able to stabilize the Western Empire's military situation somewhat, relying heavily on his Hunnic allies. With their help, he defeated the Burgundians, who had occupied part of southern Gaul after 407, and settled them in Savoy as Roman allies (433). Later that century, as Roman power faded away, the Burgundians extended their rule to the Rhone valley.\\r\\nMeanwhile, pressure from the Visigoths and a rebellion by Bonifacius, the governor of Africa, induced the Vandals under their king Gaiseric to cross over from Spain in 429. They temporarily halted in Numidia (435) before moving eastward and capturing Carthage, from where they established an independent state with a powerful navy (439). The Vandal fleet became a constant danger to Roman sea trade and the coasts and islands of the western and central Mediterranean.\\r\\nIn 444, the Huns, who had been employed as Roman allies by Aetius, were united under their ambitious king Attila. Turning against their former ally, the Huns became a formidable threat to the Empire. Attila then received a plea for help and the ring of Honoria, the Emperor's sister. Threatening war, he claimed half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry.\\r\\nFaced with refusal, he invaded Gaul and was only stopped in the battle of the Catalaunian Plains by a combined Roman-Germanic army led by Aetius. The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, Pope Leo's plea for peace, and reports of a campaign of Marcianus directed at his headquarters in Pannonia induced him to halt this campaign. Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453).\\r\\nAetius was slain in 454 by Valentinian, who was then himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later. With the end of the Theodosian dynasty, a new period of dynastic struggle ensued. The Vandals took advantage of the unrest and sailed up to Rome, which they plundered in 455.\\r\\nThe instability caused by usurpers throughout the Western Empire helped these tribes in their conquests, and by the 450s the Germanic tribes had become usurpers themselves. During the next twenty years, several Western Emperors were installed by Constantinople, but their authority relied upon barbarian commanders (Ricimer (456ÿ472), Gundobad (473ÿ475)). Majorian was the last emperor to campaign in Gaul and Spain in 458-460 before being deposed and murdered by Ricimer. From the 460s onwards, imperial control was effectively restricted to Italy and southern Gaul as the remaining Western provinces refused to accept Ricimer's appointment of Libius Severus in 461.\\r\\nIn 475, Orestes, a former secretary of Attila, drove Emperor Julius Nepos out of Ravenna and proclaimed his own son Romulus Augustus as emperor. In 476, Orestes refused to grant Odoacer and the Heruli federated status, prompting an invasion. Orestes was killed and Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustus, installed himself as ruler over Italy and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople. Although isolated pockets of Roman rule continued even after 476, the city of Rome itself was under the rule of the barbarians, and the control of Rome over the West had effectively ended.\\r\\nThree rump states continued under Roman rule in some form or another after 476: Julius Nepos controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480. Syagrius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487. Lastly, a Roman-Moor realm survived in north Africa, resisting Vandal incursions, and becoming a part of the Eastern Roman Empire c.533 when Belisarius defeated the Vandals.\\r\\nBy convention, the Western Roman Empire is deemed to have ended on 4 September 476, when Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus, but the historical record calls this determination into question.\\r\\nJulius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West, and ruled a rump state in Dalmatia. He was recognized as such by Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno and by Syagrius, who had managed to preserve Roman sovereignty in an exclave in northern Gaul, known today as the Domain of Soissons.\\r\\nOdoacer proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and began to negotiate with Zeno. Zeno eventually granted Odoacer patrician status as recognition of his authority and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy. Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire. Odoacer accepted this condition and issued coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy. This, however, was mainly an empty political gesture, as Odoacer never returned any real power or territories to Julius Nepos. The murder of Julius Nepos in 480 prompted Odoacer to invade Dalmatia, annexing it to his Kingdom of Italy.\\r\\nThe last hope for a reunited Empire came in 493, as Odoacer was replaced by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths. Theodoric had been forced to appear subservient to Zeno in order to deal with a dangerous Odoacer. While in principle Theodoric was a subordinate, a viceroy of the Emperor of the East, in fact he was his equal.\\r\\nFollowing Theodoric's death in 526, the Western half of the Empire was now fully controlled by Germanic tribes (though many of them continued to recognize Roman law and made claims to continuity), while the Eastern half had established itself under the Justinian dynasty. While the East would make some attempts to recapture the West, the Roman Empire was never reunited.\\r\\nThroughout Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Eastern Roman Empire, or the Byzantine Empire, laid claims on areas of the West which had been occupied by several tribes. In the 6th century, the Eastern Roman Empire managed to reconquer large areas of the former Western Roman Empire. The most successful were the campaigns of the generals Belisarius and Narses on behalf of the Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I from 533 to 554. The Vandal-occupied former Roman territory in North Africa was regained, particularly the territory centered around the city of Carthage. Less than a year later, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Dalmatia, and the Balearic Islands were easily captured by the invading Roman legions. The campaign eventually moved into Italy and the Byzantines reconquered it completely. Minor territories were taken as far west as the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Only three years after Justinian had died, the Lombards had invaded Italy, but the wealthiest parts of the province remained securely in Roman hands throughout the seventh century.[3]\\r\\nAlthough some eastern emperors occasionally attempted to campaign in the West, none were as successful as Justinian. After 600, events conspired to drive the Western provinces out of Constantinople's control, with imperial attention focused on the pressing issues of war with Sasanian Iran and then the rise of Arab power. For a while, the West remained important, with the Emperor Constans II ruling from Sicily a Roman Empire that still stretched from North Africa to the Caucasus in the 660s, but thereafter imperial attention declined rapidly, with Constantinople itself being besieged in the 670s, renewed war with the Arabs in the 680s, and then a period of chaos between 695 and 717, during which time Africa was finally lost to the Romans once and for all. The Emperor Leo III restored order, but his doctrinal reforms, known as the Iconoclastic Controversy, proved extremely unpopular in the West, and led to the final breakdown in imperial rule over Rome itself.\\r\\nByzantine rule continued in Sicily throughout the eighth century, with the island slowly being overrun by the Arabs over the course of the ninth century. In Italy, a few strongholds in Calabria ultimately provided a base for modest imperial expansion, which reached its peak in the early eleventh century, with most of southern Italy under \\"Roman\\" rule of a sort. This, however, was undone by further Byzantine civil war, and the slow conquest of the region by the Byzantines' former mercenaries, the Normans, who finally put an end to imperial rule in Western Europe in 1071.\\r\\nAs the Western Roman Empire crumbled, the new Germanic rulers who conquered the provinces upheld many Roman laws and traditions. Many of the invading Germanic tribes were already Christianized, although most were followers of Arianism. They quickly converted to official imperial Christianity, gaining more loyalty from the local Roman populations, as well as the recognition and support of the powerful Bishop of Rome. Although they initially continued to recognize indigenous tribal laws, they were more influenced by Roman Law and gradually incorporated it as well.\\r\\nRoman Law, particularly the Corpus Juris Civilis collected by order of Justinian I, is the ancient basis on which the modern Civil law stands. In contrast, Common law is based on the Germanic Anglo-Saxon law.\\r\\nLatin as a language never really disappeared. It combined with neighboring Germanic and Celtic languages, giving rise to many modern Romance languages such as Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian and a large number of minor languages and dialects. Today, more than 900 million people are native speakers worldwide.\\r\\nLatin also influenced Germanic languages such as English, German, and Dutch; all surviving Celtic languages, Albanian, and such Slavic languages as Polish and Czech, and even the non-Indo-European Hungarian. It survives in its \\"purer\\" form as the language of the Catholic Church (the Mass was spoken exclusively in Latin until 1969), and was used as a lingua franca between many nations.

Roman numerals continue to be used, but were mostly replaced by Arabic numerals.\\r\\nThe ideal of the Roman Empire as a mighty Christian Empire with a single ruler continued to appeal to many powerful rulers. Under the principle of translatio imperii, the Holy Roman Empire explicitly proclaimed itself as the continuation of the Western Roman Empire. The title of the Western Roman Emperor was revived when Charlemagne, King of the Franks and Lombards, was crowned as Emperor of the Romans of the West by Pope Leo III in 800. The status of the Holy Roman Emperor as the rightful Western Roman Emperor in the medieval era was further legitimated by the recognition as \\"co-emperor\\" from the Eastern Roman Emperor, who was in direct succession to the ancient Roman Emperors. The Holy Roman Empire continued to regard itself as the successor state of the Western Roman Empire until its downfall in 1806. The French King Louis XIV, as well as French Emperor Napoleon I, and the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, among others, also tried to resurrect the Empire, albeit unsuccessfully.\\r\\nA very visible legacy of the Western Roman Empire is the Roman Catholic Church. The Church slowly began to replace Roman institutions in the West, even helping to negotiate the safety of Rome during the late 5th century. In many cases the only source of law and civil administration was the local bishop, often himself a former governor like St. Ambrose of Milan and St. Germanus of Auxerre. As Rome was invaded by Germanic tribes, many assimilated, and by the middle of the medieval period (c. 9th and 10th centuries) the central, western, and northern parts of Europe had been largely converted to Roman Catholicism and acknowledged the Pope as the Vicar of Christ.\\r\\nAugusti are shown with their Caesares and regents further indented\\r\\nFlavius Orestes was killed by revolting Germanic mercenaries.

It includes zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg).[2][3][4] The further inclusion of copernicium (Cn) in group 12 is supported by recent experiments on individual copernicium atoms.[5] Group 12 is also known as the volatile metals,[citation needed] although this can also more generally refer to any metal (which need not be in group 12) that has high volatility, such as polonium[6] or flerovium.[7] Formerly this group was named IIB (pronounced as \\"group two B\\", as the \\"II\\" is a Roman numeral) by CAS and old IUPAC system.\\r\\nThe three group 12 elements that occur naturally are zinc, cadmium and mercury. They are all widely used in electric and electronic applications, as well as in various alloys. The first two members of the group share similar properties as they are solid metals under standard conditions. Mercury is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature. While zinc is very important in the biochemistry of living organisms, cadmium and mercury are both highly toxic. As copernicium does not occur in nature, it has to be synthesized in the laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike other groups of the periodic table, the members of group 12 show patterns in its electron configuration, especially the outermost shells, which result in trends in their chemical behavior:\\r\\nGroup 12 elements are all soft, diamagnetic, divalent metals. They have the lowest melting points among all transition metals.[8] Zinc is bluish-white and lustrous,[9] though most common commercial grades of the metal have a dull finish.[10] Zinc is also referred to in nonscientific contexts as spelter.[citation needed] Cadmium is soft, malleable, ductile, and with a bluish-white color. Mercury is a liquid, heavy, silvery-white metal. It is the only common liquid metal at ordinary temperatures, and as compared to other metals, it is a poor conductor of heat, but a fair conductor of electricity.[11]\\r\\nThe table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the group 12 elements. Very little is known about copernicium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its boiling point (tentative).[12]\\r\\nZinc is somewhat less dense than iron and has a hexagonal crystal structure.[13] The metal is hard and brittle at most temperatures but becomes malleable between 100 and 150?C.[9][10] Above 210?C, the metal becomes brittle again and can be pulverized by beating.[14] Zinc is a fair conductor of electricity.[9] For a metal, zinc has relatively low melting (419.5?C, 787.1?F) and boiling points (907?C).[8] Cadmium is similar in many respects to zinc but forms complex compounds.[15] Unlike other metals, cadmium is resistant to corrosion and as a result it is used as a protective layer when deposited on other metals. As a bulk metal, cadmium is insoluble in water and is not flammable; however, in its powdered form it may burn and release toxic fumes.[16] Mercury has an exceptionally low melting temperature for a d-block metal. A complete explanation of this fact requires a deep excursion into quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique electronic configuration where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d and 6s subshells. As such configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gas elements, which form weak bonds and thus easily melting solids. The stability of the 6s shell is due to the presence of a filled 4f shell. An f shell poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s shell and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f shell is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points. Gold has atoms with one less 6s electron than mercury. Those electrons are more easily removed and are shared between the gold atoms forming relatively strong metallic bonds.[17][18]\\r\\nZinc, cadmium and mercury form a large range of alloys. Among the zinc containing ones, brass is an alloy of zinc and copper. Other metals long known to form binary alloys with zinc are aluminium, antimony, bismuth, gold, iron, lead, mercury, silver, tin, magnesium, cobalt, nickel, tellurium and sodium.[19] While neither zinc nor zirconium are ferromagnetic, their alloy ZrZn\\r\\n2 exhibits ferromagnetism below 35?K.[9] Cadmium is used in many kinds of solder and bearing alloys, due to a low coefficient of friction and fatigue resistance.[20] It is also found in some of the lowest-melting alloys, such as Wood's metal.[21] Because it is a liquid, mercury dissolves other metals and the alloys that are formed are called amalgams. For example, such amalgams are known with gold, zinc, sodium, and many other metals. Because iron is an exception, iron flasks have been traditionally used to trade mercury. Other metals that do not form amalgams with mercury include tantalum, tungsten and platinum. Sodium amalgam is a common reducing agent in organic synthesis, and is also used in high-pressure sodium lamps. Mercury readily combines with aluminium to form a mercury-aluminium amalgam when the two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam reacts with air to give aluminium oxide, small amounts of mercury corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances because of the risk of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.[22]\\r\\nMost of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group 12. The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.\\r\\nAll elements in this group are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly from top to bottom of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band.[23] Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.\\r\\nZinc and cadmium are electropositive while mercury is not.[23] As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good reducing agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 in which the ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion Hg2+\\r\\n2, two mercury(I) ions come together to form a metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species.[24] Cadmium can also form species such as [Cd2Cl6]4? in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel.\\r\\nThe elements in group 12 are usually considered to be d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants.[25] There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare and those that do exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, [M(CN)2]?. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell,[26] zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury is. This is because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4).[27][28] However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested that it would be better to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.[29]\\r\\nAlthough group 12 lies in the d-block of the modern 18-column periodic table, the d electrons of zinc, cadmium, and (almost always) mercury behave as core electrons and do not take part in bonding. This behavior is similar to that of the main-group elements, but is in stark contrast to that of the neighboring group 11 elements (copper, silver, and gold), which also have filled d-subshells in their ground-state electron configuration but behave chemically as transition metals. For example, the bonding in chromium(II) sulfide (CrS) involves mainly the 3d electrons; that in iron(II) sulfide (FeS) involves both the 3d and 4s electrons; but that of zinc sulfide (ZnS) involves only the 4s electrons and the 3d electrons behave as core electrons. Indeed, useful comparison can be made between their properties and the first two members of group 2, beryllium and magnesium, and in earlier short-form periodic table layouts, this relationship is illustrated more clearly. For instance, zinc and cadmium are similar to beryllium and magnesium in their atomic radii, ionic radii, electronegativities, and also in the structure of their binary compounds and their ability to form complex ions with many nitrogen and oxygen ligands, such as complex hydrides and amines. However, beryllium and magnesium are small atoms, unlike the heavier alkaline earth metals and like the group 12 elements (which have a greater nuclear charge but the same number of valence electrons), and the periodic trends down group 2 from beryllium to radium (similar to that of the alkali metals) are not as smooth when going down from beryllium to mercury (which is more similar to that of the p-block main groups) due to the d-block and lanthanide contractions. It is also the d-block and lanthanide contractions that give mercury many of its distinctive properties.[29]\\r\\nAll three metal ions form many tetrahedral species, such as MCl2?\\r\\n4. Both zinc and cadmium can also form octahedral complexes such as the aqua ions [M(H2O)6]2+ which are present in aqueous solutions of salts of these metals.[35] Covalent character is achieved by using the s and possibly p orbitals. Mercury, however, rarely exceeds a coordination number of four. Coordination numbers of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 are also known.\\r\\nAlthough copernicium is the heaviest known group 12 element, there has been some theoretical work regarding possible heavier group 12 elements. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 162, unhexbium (Uhb), under copernicium, relativistic Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next group 12 element after copernicium should actually be element 164, unhexquadium (Uhq), which is predicted to have an electron configuration of [Og] 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p1/22.[33][36] The 8s and 8p1/2 orbitals are predicted to be so strongly stabilized relativistically that they become core electrons and do not participate in chemical reactions, unlike the earlier group 12 elements where the s electrons behave as valence electrons. However, the 9s and 9p1/2 levels are expected to be readily available for hybridization and bonding, so that unhexquadium should still behave chemically like a normal transition metal. Calculations predict that the 7d electrons of unhexquadium should participate very readily in chemical reactions, so that unhexquadium should be able to show stable +6 and +4 oxidation states in addition to the normal +2 state in aqueous solutions with strong ligands. Unhexquadium should thus be able to form compounds like Uhq(CO)4, Uhq(PF3)4 (both tetrahedral), and Uhq(CN)2?\\r\\n2 (linear), which is very different behavior from that of lead, which unhexquadium would be a heavier homologue of if not for relativistic effects. Nevertheless, the divalent state would be the main one in aqueous solution, and unhexquadium(II) should behave more similarly to lead than unhexquadium(IV) and unhexquadium(VI).[33][34]\\r\\nUnhexquadium should be a soft metal like mercury, and metallic unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It is also expected to be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4?eV. It should also have some similarities to oganesson as well as to the other group 12 elements.[33] Unhexquadium should be at most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685?kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum.[34][37] Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158?pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474?u, about 19.5?times as much as that of magnesium.[37] This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46?g{cm?3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61?g{cm?3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47?g{cm?3).[37] Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.[34]\\r\\nTheoretical interest in the chemistry of unhexquadium is largely motivated by theoretical predictions that it, especially the isotope 482Uhq (with 164 protons and 318 neutrons), would be at the center of a hypothetical second island of stability (the first being centered around 306Ubb, with 122 protons and 184 neutrons).[38][39][40]\\r\\nThe elements of group 12 have been found throughout history, being used since ancient times to being discovered in laboratories. The group itself has not acquired a trivial name, but it has been called group IIB in the past.\\r\\nZinc has been found being used in impure forms in ancient times as well as in alloys such as brass that have been found to be over 2000 years old.[41][42] Zinc was distinctly recognized as a metal under the designation of Fasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374.[43] The metal was also of use to alchemists.[44] The name of the metal was first documented in the 16th century,[45][46] and is probably derived from the German zinke for the needle-like appearance of metallic crystals.[47]\\r\\nThe isolation of metallic zinc in the West may have been achieved independently by several people in the 17th century.[48] German chemist Andreas Marggraf is usually given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in a 1746 experiment by heating a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal.[49] Experiments on frogs by the Italian doctor Luigi Galvani in 1780 with brass paved the way for the discovery of electrical batteries, galvanization and cathodic protection.[50][51] In 1880, Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, invented the Voltaic pile.[50] The biological importance of zinc was not discovered until 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site.[52]\\r\\nIn 1817, cadmium was discovered in Germany as an impurity in zinc carbonate minerals (calamine) by Friedrich Stromeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann.[53] It was named after the Latin cadmia for \\"calamine\\", a cadmium-bearing mixture of minerals, which was in turn named after the Greek mythological character, ?Ѵ? Cadmus, the founder of Thebes.[54] Stromeyer eventually isolated cadmium metal by roasting and reduction of the sulfide.[55][56][57]\\r\\nIn 1927, the International Conference on Weights and Measures redefined the meter in terms of a red cadmium spectral line (1 m = 1,553,164.13 wavelengths).[58] This definition has since been changed (see krypton). At the same time, the International Prototype Meter was used as standard for the length of a meter until 1960,[59] when at the General Conference on Weights and Measures the meter was defined in terms of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in vacuum.[60]\\r\\nMercury has been found in Egyptian tombs which have been dated back to 1500 BC,[61] where mercury was used in cosmetics. It was also used by the ancient Chinese who believed it would improve and prolong health.[62] By 500 BC mercury was used to make amalgams (Medieval Latin amalgama, \\"alloy of mercury\\") with other metals.[63] Alchemists thought of mercury as the First Matter from which all metals were formed. They believed that different metals could be produced by varying the quality and quantity of sulfur contained within the mercury. The purest of these was gold, and mercury was called for in attempts at the transmutation of base (or impure) metals into gold, which was the goal of many alchemists.[64]\\r\\nHg is the modern chemical symbol for mercury. It comes from hydrargyrum, a Latinized form of the Greek word ?Ѵϫ? (hydrargyros), which is a compound word meaning \\"water-silver\\" (hydr- = water, argyros = silver)? since it is liquid like water and shiny like silver. The element was named after the Roman god Mercury, known for speed and mobility. It is associated with the planet Mercury; the astrological symbol for the planet is also one of the alchemical symbols for the metal.[65] Mercury is the only metal for which the alchemical planetary name became the common name.[64]\\r\\nThe heaviest known group 12 element, copernicium, was first created on February 9, 1996, at the Gesellschaft fr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, by Sigurd Hofmann, Victor Ninov et al.[66] It was then officially named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) after Nicolaus Copernicus on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus' birth.[67]\\r\\nLike in most other d-block groups, the abundance in Earth's crust of group 12 elements decreases with higher atomic number. Zinc is with 65 parts per million (ppm) the most abundant in the group while cadmium with 0.1 ppm and mercury with 0.08 ppm are orders of magnitude less abundant.[68] Copernicium, as a synthetic element with a half-life of a few minutes, may only be present in the laboratories where it was produced.\\r\\nGroup 12 metals are chalcophiles, meaning the elements have low affinities for oxides and prefer to bond with sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere.[69] The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals.[23] Sphalerite, which is a form of zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60ÿ62% zinc.[13] No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. Greenockite (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper.[70][71] One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia.[72] Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust,[73] because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.[74]\\r\\nWhile mercury and zinc minerals are found in large enough quantities to be mined, cadmium is too similar to zinc and therefore is always present in small quantities in zinc ores from where it is recovered. Identified world zinc resources total about 1.9 billion tonnes.[75] Large deposits are in Australia, Canada and the United States with the largest reserves in Iran.[69][76][77] At the current rate of consumption, these reserves are estimated to be depleted sometime between 2027 and 2055.[78][79] About 346 million tonnes have been extracted throughout history to 2002, and one estimate found that about 109 million tonnes of that remains in use.[80] In 2005, China was the top producer of mercury with almost two-thirds global share followed by Kyrgyzstan.[81] Several other countries are believed to have unrecorded production of mercury from copper electrowinning processes and by recovery from effluents. Because of the high toxicity of mercury, both the mining of cinnabar and refining for mercury are hazardous and historic causes of mercury poisoning.[82]\\r\\nZinc is the fourth most common metal in use, trailing only iron, aluminium, and copper with an annual production of about 10 million tonnes.[83] Worldwide, 95% of the zinc is mined from sulfidic ore deposits, in which sphalerite (ZnS) is nearly always mixed with the sulfides of copper, lead and iron. Zinc metal is produced using extractive metallurgy.[84] Roasting converts the zinc sulfide concentrate produced during processing to zinc oxide:[85] For further processing two basic methods are used: pyrometallurgy or electrowinning. Pyrometallurgy processing reduces zinc oxide with carbon or carbon monoxide at 950?C (1,740?F) into the metal, which is distilled as zinc vapor.[86] The zinc vapor is collected in a condenser.[85] Electrowinning processing leaches zinc from the ore concentrate by sulfuric acid:[87] After this step electrolysis is used to produce zinc metal.[85]\\r\\nCadmium is a common impurity in zinc ores, and it is most isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium.[88] Cadmium is isolated from the zinc produced from the flue dust by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated out of the electrolysis solution.[89]\\r\\nThe richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury, with cinnabar (HgS) being the most common ore in the deposits.[90] Mercury is extracted by heating cinnabar in a current of air and condensing the vapor.[91]\\r\\nSuper-heavy elements such as copernicium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of copernicium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.[92] The first fusion reaction to produce copernicium was performed by GSI in 1996, who reported the detection of two decay chains of copernicium-277.[66]\\r\\nIn total, approximately 75 atoms of copernicium have been prepared using various nuclear reactions.\\r\\nDue to the physical similarities which they share, the group 12 elements can be found in many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents[2] as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode.[93] These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal,[94] or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts.[95] Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act as an alternative to the standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.[96]\\r\\nIn the US, zinc is used predominantly for galvanizing (55%) and for brass, bronze and other alloys (37%).[97] The relative reactivity of zinc and its ability to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe.[98] Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline.[98][note 4] Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water from corrosion.[99][100] Zinc is also used as an anode material for batteries such as in zincÿcarbon batteries[101][102] or zinc-air battery/fuel cells.[103][104][105] A widely used alloy which contains zinc is brass, in which copper is alloyed with anywhere from 3% to 45% zinc, depending upon the type of brass.[98] Brass is generally more ductile and stronger than copper and has superior corrosion resistance.[98] These properties make it useful in communication equipment, hardware, musical instruments, and water valves.[98] Other widely used alloys that contain zinc include nickel silver, typewriter metal, soft and aluminium solder, and commercial bronze.[9] Alloys of primarily zinc with small amounts of copper, aluminium, and magnesium are useful in die casting as well as spin casting, especially in the automotive, electrical, and hardware industries.[9] These alloys are marketed under the name Zamak.[106] Roughly one quarter of all zinc output, in the United States (2009), is consumed in the form of zinc compounds, a variety of which are used industrially.[97]\\r\\nCadmium has many common industrial uses as it is a key component in battery production, is present in cadmium pigments,[107] coatings,[95] and is commonly used in electroplating.[20] In 2009, 86% of cadmium was used in batteries, predominantly in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. The European Union banned the use of cadmium in electronics in 2004 with several exceptions but reduced the allowed content of cadmium in electronics to 0.002%.[108] Cadmium electroplating, consuming 6% of the global production, can be found in the aircraft industry due to the ability to resist corrosion when applied to steel components.[20]\\r\\nMercury is used primarily for the manufacture of industrial chemicals or for electrical and electronic applications. It is used in some thermometers, especially ones which are used to measure high temperatures. A still increasing amount is used as gaseous mercury in fluorescent lamps,[109] while most of the other applications are slowly phased out due to health and safety regulations,[110] and is in some applications replaced with less toxic but considerably more expensive Galinstan alloy.[111] Mercury and its compounds have been used in medicine, although they are much less common today than they once were, now that the toxic effects of mercury and its compounds are more widely understood.[112] It is still used as an ingredient in dental amalgams. In the late 20th century the largest use of mercury[113][114] was in the mercury cell process (also called the Castner-Kellner process) in the production of chlorine and caustic soda.[115]\\r\\nThe group 12 elements have multiple effects on biological organisms as cadmium and mercury are toxic while zinc is required by most plants and animals in trace amounts.\\r\\nZinc is an essential trace element, necessary for plants,[116] animals,[117] and microorganisms.[118] It is \\"typically the second most abundant transition metal in organisms\\" after iron and it is the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes.[116] There are 2ÿ4?grams of zinc[119] distributed throughout the human body,[120] and it plays \\"ubiquitous biological roles\\".[121] A 2006 study estimated that about 10% of human proteins (2800) potentially bind zinc, in addition to hundreds which transport and traffic zinc.[116] In the U.S., the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is 8?mg/day for women and 11?mg/day for men.[122] Harmful excessive supplementation may be a problem and should probably not exceed 20?mg/day in healthy people,[123] although the U.S. National Research Council set a Tolerable Upper Intake of 40?mg/day.[124]\\r\\nMercury and cadmium are toxic and may cause environmental damage if they enter rivers or rain water. This may result in contaminated crops[125] as well as the bioaccumulation of mercury in a food chain leading to an increase in illnesses caused by mercury and cadmium poisoning.[126]\\r\\nZinc\\r\\nZn\\r\\nAtomic Number: 30\\r\\nAtomic Weight: 65.38\\r\\nMelting Point: 692.88 K\\r\\nBoiling Point: 1180 K\\r\\nSpecific mass: 7.134 g/cm3\\r\\nElectronegativity: 1.65\\r\\nCadmium\\r\\nCd\\r\\nAtomic Number: 48\\r\\nAtomic Weight: 112.411\\r\\nMelting Point: 594.33 K\\r\\nBoiling Point: 1040 K\\r\\nSpecific mass: 8.69 g/cm3\\r\\nElectronegativity: 1.69\\r\\nMercury\\r\\nHg\\r\\nAtomic Number: 80\\r\\nAtomic Weight: 200.59\\r\\nMelting Point: 234.43 K\\r\\nBoiling Point: 630 K\\r\\nSpecific mass: 13.5336 g/cm3\\r\\nElectronegativity: 2.00\\r\\nCopernicium\\r\\nCn\\r\\nAtomic Number: 112\\r\\nAtomic Weight: [285]\\r\\nMelting Point:??

The eventual end of the period of Islamic rule of India is marked by the two main events Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the beginning of British rule, although Islamic rule persisted in Hyderabad State and other minor princely states until Union of India in 1948. However, most Islamic rules had started to wane in the 17th and 18th century before that.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the last quarter of the 12th century, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Indo-Gangetic plain, conquering in succession Ghazni, Multan, Sindh, Lahore, and Delhi. Qutb-ud-din Aybak, one of his generals proclaimed himself Sultan of Delhi. In the 13th century, Shamsuddؐn Iltutmish (1211ÿ1236), a former slave-warrior, established a Turkic kingdom in Delhi, which enabled future sultans to push in every direction; within the next 100 years, the Delhi Sultanate extended its way east to Bengal and south to the Deccan, while the sultanate itself experienced repeated threats from the northwest and internal revolts from displeased, independent-minded nobles. The sultanate was in constant flux as five dynasties, all of either Turkic or Afghan origin,[3] rose and fell: the Slave dynasty (1206ÿ90), Khalji dynasty (1290ÿ1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320ÿ1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414ÿ51), and Lodi dynasty (1451ÿ1526). The Khalji dynasty, under 'Al'uddؐn (1296ÿ1316), succeeded in bringing most of South India under its control for a time, although conquered areas broke away quickly. Power in Delhi was often gained by violencenineteen of the thirty-five sultans were assassinatedand was legitimized by reward for tribal loyalty. Factional rivalries and court intrigues were as numerous as they were treacherous; territories controlled by the sultan expanded and shrank depending on his personality and fortunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the Qur'an and sharia (Islamic law) provided the basis for enforcing Islamic administration over the independent Hindu rulers, but the sultanate made only fitful progress in the beginning when many campaigns were undertaken for plunder and temporary reduction of fortresses. The effective rule of a sultan depended largely on his ability to control the strategic places that dominated the military highways and trade routes, extract the annual land tax, and maintain personal authority over military and provincial governors. Sultan 'Ala ud-Din made an attempt to reassess, systematize, and unify land revenues and urban taxes and to institute a highly centralized system of administration over his realm, but his efforts were abortive. Although agriculture in North India improved as a result of new canal construction and irrigation methods, including what came to be known as the Persian wheel, prolonged political instability and parasitic methods of tax collection brutalized the peasantry. Yet trade and a market economy, encouraged by the free-spending habits of the aristocracy, acquired new impetus both in and overseas. Experts in metalwork, stonework, and textile manufacture responded to the new patronage with enthusiasm. In this period Persian language and many Persian cultural aspects became dominant in the centers of power in Meric'a, as the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate (who, though being Turkish or Afghan, had been thoroughly Persianized since the era of the Ghaznavids)[4]  patronized aspects of the foreign culture and language from their seat of power in India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sultans' failure to hold securely the Deccan and South India resulted in the rise of competing for Southern dynasties: the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate (1347ÿ1527) and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire (1336ÿ1565). Zafar Khan, a former provincial governor under the Tughluqs, revolted against his Turkic overlord and proclaimed himself sultan, taking the title Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in 1347. The Bahmani Sultanate, located in the northern Deccan, lasted for almost two centuries, until it fragmented into five smaller states, known as the Deccan sultanates (Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmednagar, Berar, and Bidar) in 1527. The Bahmani Sultanate adopted the patterns established by the Delhi overlords in tax collection and administration, but its downfall was caused in large measure by the competition and hatred between Deccani (domiciled Muslim immigrants and local converts) and paradesi (foreigners or officials in temporary service). The Bahmani Sultanate initiated a process of cultural synthesis visible in Hyderabad where cultural flowering is still expressed in vigorous schools of Deccani architecture and painting.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in 1336, the Vijayanagara Empire (named for its capital Vijayanagara (Vijayanagar), \\"City of Victory,\\" in present-day Karnataka) expanded rapidly toward Madurai in the south and Goa in the west and exerted intermittent control over the east coast and the extreme southwest. Vijayanagara rulers closely followed Chola precedents, especially in collecting agricultural and trade revenues, in giving encouragement to commercial guilds, and in honoring temples with lavish endowments. Added revenue needed for waging war against the Bahmani sultans was raised by introducing a set of taxes on commercial enterprises, professions, and industries. Political rivalry between the Bahmani and the Vijayanagara rulers involved control over the Krishna-Tungabhadra river basin, which shifted hands depending on whose military was superior at any given time. The Vijayanagar rulers' capacity for gaining victory over their enemies was contingent on ensuring a constant supply of horsesinitially through Arab traders but later through the Portugueseand maintaining internal roads and communication networks. Merchant guilds enjoyed a wide sphere of operation and were able to offset the power of landlords and Brahmans in court politics. Commerce and shipping eventually passed largely into the hands of foreigners, and special facilities and tax concessions were provided for them by the ruler.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Vijayanagara itself contained numerous temples with rich ornamentation, especially the gateways, and a cluster of shrines for the deities. Most prominent among the temples was the one dedicated to Virupaksha, a manifestation of Shiva, the patron-deity of the Vijayanagar rulers. Temples continued to be the nuclei of diverse cultural and intellectual activities, but these activities were based more on tradition than on contemporary political realities. When the rulers of the five Deccan sultanates combined their forces and attacked Vijayanagara in 1565, the empire crumbled at the Battle of Talikot. Most Muslim rulers of south India were Shia muslims.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mughal Empire was an empire that at its greatest territorial extent ruled most of the Indian subcontinent between 1526 and 1707. The empire was founded by the Turco-Mongol leader Babur in 1526, when he defeated Ibrahim Lodi, the last Pashtun ruler of the Delhi Sultanate at the First Battle of Panipat. The word \\"Mughal\\" is the Persian version of Mongol. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb were prominent rulers of Mughal empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNizam, a shortened version of Nizam-ul-Mulk, meaning Administrator of the Realm, was the title of the native sovereigns of Hyderabad state, India, since 1719, belonging to the Asaf Jah dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721 who intermittently ruled under the title Asaf Jah in 1924. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal Empire crumbled, and the viceroy in Hyderabad, the young Asaf Jah, declared himself independent.\\r\\n\\r\\nNawab of Awadh ruled parts of current day Uttar Pradesh.

Taken together, these systems are sometimes referred to as the car's computer (Technically there is no single computer but multiple ones.) Sometimes one assembly incorporates several of the individual control modules (PCM is often both engine and transmission).[1]\\r\\nSome modern motor vehicles have up to 80 ECUs. Embedded software in ECUs continues to increase in line count, complexity, and sophistication.[2] Managing the increasing complexity and number of ECUs in a vehicle has become a key challenge for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Examples of such ECUs include:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development of an ECU involves both hardware and software required to perform the functions expected from that particular module. Automotive ECU's are being developed following the V-model.[1] Recently the trend is to dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to develop safe modules by following standards like ISO 26262.[3] It is rare that a module is developed fully from scratch. The design is generally iterative and improvements are made to both the hardware and software. The development of most ECU's are carried out by Tier 1 suppliers based on specifications provided by the OEM.\\r\\nAs part of the development cycle, manufacturers perform detailed FMEAs and other failure analyses to catch failure modes that can lead to unsafe conditions or driver annoyance. Extensive testing and validation activities are carried out as part of the Production part approval process to gain confidence of the hardware and software. On-board diagnostics or OBD help provide specific data related to which system or component failed or caused a failure during run time and help perform repairs.\\r\\nSome people may wish to modify their ECU so as to be able to add more functionality to it. Most ECU's these days however come equipped with protection locks which prevent users from modifying the ECU. The protection locks are made in a way that, when circumvented, triggers DMCA liability. This in effect makes modifying the ECU by circumventing the protection illegal [4] except if done under an exception[5] to the DMCA.","input":"How many electronic control units in a car?"},{"output":"The Siege of Rhodes","context":"","input":"What is considered to be the first musical in western musical theatre?"},{"output":"23 chromosome pairs","context":"3,234.83 Mb (Mega-basepairs) per haploid genome\\r\\nThe human genome is the complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as DNA within the 23 chromosome pairs in cell nuclei and in a small DNA molecule found within individual mitochondria. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA genes and noncoding DNA. Haploid human genomes, which are contained in germ cells (the egg and sperm gamete cells created in the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction before fertilization creates a zygote) consist of three billion DNA base pairs, while diploid genomes (found in somatic cells) have twice the DNA content. While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1%),[1] these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the chimpanzees (approximately 4%[2]) and bonobos.\\r\\nThe Human Genome Project produced the first complete sequences of individual human genomes, with the first draft sequence and initial analysis being published on February 12, 2001.[3] The human genome was the first of all vertebrates to be completely sequenced. As of 2012, thousands of human genomes have been completely sequenced, and many more have been mapped at lower levels of resolution. The resulting data are used worldwide in biomedical science, anthropology, forensics and other branches of science. There is a widely held expectation that genomic studies will lead to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and to new insights in many fields of biology, including human evolution.\\r\\nAlthough the sequence of the human genome has been (almost) completely determined by DNA sequencing, it is not yet fully understood. Most (though probably not all) genes have been identified by a combination of high throughput experimental and bioinformatics approaches, yet much work still needs to be done to further elucidate the biological functions of their protein and RNA products. Recent results suggest that most of the vast quantities of noncoding DNA within the genome have associated biochemical activities, including regulation of gene expression, organization of chromosome architecture, and signals controlling epigenetic inheritance.\\r\\nThere are an estimated 19,000-20,000 human protein-coding genes.[4] The estimate of the number of human genes has been repeatedly revised down from initial predictions of 100,000 or more as genome sequence quality and gene finding methods have improved, and could continue to drop further.[5][6] Protein-coding sequences account for only a very small fraction of the genome (approximately 1.5%), and the rest is associated with non-coding RNA molecules, regulatory DNA sequences, LINEs, SINEs, introns, and sequences for which as yet no function has been determined.[7]\\r\\nIn June 2016, scientists formally announced HGP-Write, a plan to synthesize the human genome.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base pairs. The genome is organized into 22 paired chromosomes, plus the X chromosome (one in males, two in females) and, in males only, one Y chromosome. These are all large linear DNA molecules contained within the cell nucleus. The genome also includes the mitochondrial DNA, a comparatively small circular molecule present in each mitochondrion. Basic information about these molecules and their gene content, based on a reference genome that does not represent the sequence of any specific individual, are provided in the following table. (Data source: Ensembl genome browser release 87, December 2016 for most values; Ensembl genome browser release 68, July 2012 for miRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA.)\\r\\nTable 1 (above) summarizes the physical organization and gene content of the human reference genome, with links to the original analysis, as published in the Ensembl database at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Chromosome lengths were estimated by multiplying the number of base pairs by 0.34 nanometers, the distance between base pairs in the DNA double helix. The number of proteins is based on the number of initial precursor mRNA transcripts, and does not include products of alternative pre-mRNA splicing, or modifications to protein structure that occur after translation.\\r\\nVariations are unique DNA sequence differences that have been identified in the individual human genome sequences analyzed by Ensembl as of December, 2016. The number of identified variations is expected to increase as further personal genomes are sequenced and analyzed. In addition to the gene content shown in this table, a large number of non-expressed functional sequences have been identified throughout the human genome (see below). Links open windows to the reference chromosome sequences in the EBI genome browser.\\r\\nSmall non-coding RNAs are RNAs of as many as 200 bases that do not have protein-coding potential. These include: microRNAs, or miRNAs (post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression), small nuclear RNAs, or snRNAs (the RNA components of spliceosomes), and small nucleolar RNAs, or snoRNA (involved in guiding chemical modifications to other RNA molecules). Long non-coding RNAs are RNA molecules longer than 200 bases that do not have protein-coding potential. These include: ribosomal RNAs, or rRNAs (the RNA components of ribosomes), and a variety of other long RNAs that are involved in regulation of gene expression, epigenetic modifications of DNA nucleotides and histone proteins, and regulation of the activity of protein-coding genes. Small discrepancies between total-small-ncRNA numbers and the numbers of specific types of small ncNRAs result from the former values being sourced from Ensembl release 87 and the latter from Ensembl release 68.\\r\\nAlthough the human genome has been completely sequenced for all practical purposes, there are still hundreds of gaps in the sequence. A recent study noted more than 160 euchromatic gaps of which 50 gaps were closed.[10] However, there are still numerous gaps in the heterochromatic parts of the genome which is much harder to sequence due to numerous repeats and other intractable sequence features.\\r\\nThe human reference genome (GRC v38) has been successfully compressed to ~5.2-fold (marginal less than 550 MB) in 155 minutes using a desktop computer with 6.4 GB of RAM.[11]\\r\\nThe content of the human genome is commonly divided into coding and noncoding DNA sequences. Coding DNA is defined as those sequences that can be transcribed into mRNA and translated into proteins during the human life cycle; these sequences occupy only a small fraction of the genome (<2%). Noncoding DNA is made up of all of those sequences (ca. 98% of the genome) that are not used to encode proteins.\\r\\nSome noncoding DNA contains genes for RNA molecules with important biological functions (noncoding RNA, for example ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA). The exploration of the function and evolutionary origin of noncoding DNA is an important goal of contemporary genome research, including the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, which aims to survey the entire human genome, using a variety of experimental tools whose results are indicative of molecular activity.\\r\\nBecause non-coding DNA greatly outnumbers coding DNA, the concept of the sequenced genome has become a more focused analytical concept than the classical concept of the DNA-coding gene.[12][13]\\r\\nMutation rate of human genome is a very important factor in calculating evolutionary time points. Researchers calculated the number of genetic variations between human and apes. Dividing that number by age of fossil of most recent common ancestor of humans and ape, researchers calculated the mutation rate. Recent studies using next generation sequencing technologies concluded a slow mutation rate which doesn't add up with human migration pattern time points and suggesting a new evolutionary time scale.[14] 100,000 year old human fossils found in Israel have served to compound this new found uncertainty of the human migration timeline.[14]\\r\\nProtein-coding sequences represent the most widely studied and best understood component of the human genome. These sequences ultimately lead to the production of all human proteins, although several biological processes (e.g. DNA rearrangements and alternative pre-mRNA splicing) can lead to the production of many more unique proteins than the number of protein-coding genes.\\r\\nThe complete modular protein-coding capacity of the genome is contained within the exome, and consists of DNA sequences encoded by exons that can be translated into proteins. Because of its biological importance, and the fact that it constitutes less than 2% of the genome, sequencing of the exome was the first major milepost of the Human Genome Project.\\r\\nNumber of protein-coding genes. About 20,000 human proteins have been annotated in databases such as Uniprot.[16] Historically, estimates for the number of protein genes have varied widely, ranging up to 2,000,000 in the late 1960s,[17] but several researchers pointed out in the early 1970s that the estimated mutational load from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit of approximately 40,000 for the total number of functional loci (this includes protein-coding and functional non-coding genes).[18]\\r\\nThe number of human protein-coding genes is not significantly larger than that of many less complex organisms, such as the roundworm and the fruit fly. This difference may result from the extensive use of alternative pre-mRNA splicing in humans, which provides the ability to build a very large number of modular proteins through the selective incorporation of exons.\\r\\nProtein-coding capacity per chromosome. Protein-coding genes are distributed unevenly across the chromosomes, ranging from a few dozen to more than 2000, with an especially high gene density within chromosomes 19, 11, and 1 (Table 1). Each chromosome contains various gene-rich and gene-poor regions, which may be correlated with chromosome bands and GC-content[citation needed]. The significance of these nonrandom patterns of gene density is not well understood.[19]\\r\\nSize of protein-coding genes. The size of protein-coding genes within the human genome shows enormous variability (Table 2). The median size of a protein-coding gene is 26,288 bp (mean = 66,577 bp; Table 2 in [20]). For example, the gene for histone H1a (HIST1HIA) is relatively small and simple, lacking introns and encoding mRNA sequences of 781 nt and a 215 amino acid protein (648 nt open reading frame). Dystrophin (DMD) is the largest protein-coding gene in the human reference genome, spanning a total of 2.2 MB, while Titin (TTN) has the longest coding sequence (114,414 bp), the largest number of exons (363),[21] and the longest single exon (17,106 bp). Over the whole genome, the median size of an exon is 122 bp (mean = 145 bp), the median number of exons is 7 (mean = 8.8), and the median coding sequence encodes 367 amino acids (mean = 447 amino acids; Table 21 in[7] ).\\r\\nTable 2. Examples of human protein-coding genes. Chrom, chromosome. Alt splicing, alternative pre-mRNA splicing. (Data source: Ensembl genome browser release 68, July 2012)\\r\\nRecently, a systematic meta-analysis of updated data of the human genome [20] found that the largest protein-coding gene in the human reference genome is RBFOX1 (RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog 1), spanning a total of 2.47 MB. Over the whole genome, considering a curated set of protein-coding genes, the median size of an exon is currently estimated to be 133 bp (mean = 309 bp), the median number of exons is currently estimated to be 8 (mean = 11), and the median coding sequence is currently estimated to encode 425 amino acids (mean = 553 amino acids; Tables 2 and 5 in[20]).\\r\\nNoncoding DNA is defined as all of the DNA sequences within a genome that are not found within protein-coding exons, and so are never represented within the amino acid sequence of expressed proteins. By this definition, more than 98% of the human genomes is composed of ncDNA.\\r\\nNumerous classes of noncoding DNA have been identified, including genes for noncoding RNA (e.g. tRNA and rRNA), pseudogenes, introns, untranslated regions of mRNA, regulatory DNA sequences, repetitive DNA sequences, and sequences related to mobile genetic elements.\\r\\nNumerous sequences that are included within genes are also defined as noncoding DNA. These include genes for noncoding RNA (e.g. tRNA, rRNA), and untranslated components of protein-coding genes (e.g. introns, and 5' and 3' untranslated regions of mRNA).\\r\\nProtein-coding sequences (specifically, coding exons) constitute less than 1.5% of the human genome.[7] In addition, about 26% of the human genome is introns.[22] Aside from genes (exons and introns) and known regulatory sequences (8ÿ20%), the human genome contains regions of noncoding DNA. The exact amount of noncoding DNA that plays a role in cell physiology has been hotly debated. Recent analysis by the ENCODE project indicates that 80% of the entire human genome is either transcribed, binds to regulatory proteins, or is associated with some other biochemical activity.[6]\\r\\nIt however remains controversial whether all of this biochemical activity contributes to cell physiology, or whether a substantial portion of this is the result transcriptional and biochemical noise, which must be actively filtered out by the organism.[23] Excluding protein-coding sequences, introns, and regulatory regions, much of the non-coding DNA is composed of: Many DNA sequences that do not play a role in gene expression have important biological functions. Comparative genomics studies indicate that about 5% of the genome contains sequences of noncoding DNA that are highly conserved, sometimes on time-scales representing hundreds of millions of years, implying that these noncoding regions are under strong evolutionary pressure and positive selection.[24]\\r\\nMany of these sequences regulate the structure of chromosomes by limiting the regions of heterochromatin formation and regulating structural features of the chromosomes, such as the telomeres and centromeres. Other noncoding regions serve as origins of DNA replication. Finally several regions are transcribed into functional noncoding RNA that regulate the expression of protein-coding genes (for example[25] ), mRNA translation and stability (see miRNA), chromatin structure (including histone modifications, for example[26] ), DNA methylation (for example[27] ), DNA recombination (for example[28] ), and cross-regulate other noncoding RNAs (for example[29] ). It is also likely that many transcribed noncoding regions do not serve any role and that this transcription is the product of non-specific RNA Polymerase activity.[23]\\r\\nPseudogenes are inactive copies of protein-coding genes, often generated by gene duplication, that have become nonfunctional through the accumulation of inactivating mutations. Table 1 shows that the number of pseudogenes in the human genome is on the order of 13,000,[30] and in some chromosomes is nearly the same as the number of functional protein-coding genes. Gene duplication is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution.\\r\\nFor example, the olfactory receptor gene family is one of the best-documented examples of pseudogenes in the human genome. More than 60 percent of the genes in this family are non-functional pseudogenes in humans. By comparison, only 20 percent of genes in the mouse olfactory receptor gene family are pseudogenes. Research suggests that this is a species-specific characteristic, as the most closely related primates all have proportionally fewer pseudogenes. This genetic discovery helps to explain the less acute sense of smell in humans relative to other mammals.[31]\\r\\nNoncoding RNA molecules play many essential roles in cells, especially in the many reactions of protein synthesis and RNA processing. Noncoding RNA include tRNA, ribosomal RNA, microRNA, snRNA and other non-coding RNA genes including about 60,000 long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs).[6][32][33][34] Although the number of reported lncRNA genes continues to rise and the exact number in the human genome is yet to be defined, many of them are argued to be non-functional.[35]\\r\\nMany ncRNAs are critical elements in gene regulation and expression. Noncoding RNA also contributes to epigenetics, transcription, RNA splicing, and the translational machinery. The role of RNA in genetic regulation and disease offers a new potential level of unexplored genomic complexity.[36]\\r\\nIn addition to the ncRNA molecules that are encoded by discrete genes, the initial transcripts of protein coding genes usually contain extensive noncoding sequences, in the form of introns, 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR), and 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). Within most protein-coding genes of the human genome, the length of intron sequences is 10- to 100-times the length of exon sequences (Table 2).\\r\\nThe human genome has many different regulatory sequences which are crucial to controlling gene expression. Conservative estimates indicate that these sequences make up 8% of the genome,[37] however extrapolations from the ENCODE project give that 20[38]-40%[39] of the genome is gene regulatory sequence. Some types of non-coding DNA are genetic \\"switches\\" that do not encode proteins, but do regulate when and where genes are expressed (called enhancers).[40]\\r\\nRegulatory sequences have been known since the late 1960s.[41] The first identification of regulatory sequences in the human genome relied on recombinant DNA technology.[42] Later with the advent of genomic sequencing, the identification of these sequences could be inferred by evolutionary conservation. The evolutionary branch between the primates and mouse, for example, occurred 70ÿ90 million years ago.[43] So computer comparisons of gene sequences that identify conserved non-coding sequences will be an indication of their importance in duties such as gene regulation.[44]\\r\\nOther genomes have been sequenced with the same intention of aiding conservation-guided methods, for exampled the pufferfish genome.[45] However, regulatory sequences disappear and re-evolve during evolution at a high rate.[46][47][48]\\r\\nAs of 2012, the efforts have shifted toward finding interactions between DNA and regulatory proteins by the technique ChIP-Seq, or gaps where the DNA is not packaged by histones (DNase hypersensitive sites), both of which tell where there are active regulatory sequences in the investigated cell type.[37]\\r\\nRepetitive DNA sequences comprise approximately 50% of the human genome.[49]\\r\\nAbout 8% of the human genome consists of tandem DNA arrays or tandem repeats, low complexity repeat sequences that have multiple adjacent copies (e.g. \\"CAGCAGCAG...\\").[citation needed] The tandem sequences may be of variable lengths, from two nucleotides to tens of nucleotides. These sequences are highly variable, even among closely related individuals, and so are used for genealogical DNA testing and forensic DNA analysis.[50]\\r\\nRepeated sequences of fewer than ten nucleotides (e.g. the dinucleotide repeat (AC)n) are termed microsatellite sequences. Among the microsatellite sequences, trinucleotide repeats are of particular importance, as sometimes occur within coding regions of genes for proteins and may lead to genetic disorders. For example, Huntington's disease results from an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n within the Huntingtin gene on human chromosome 4. Telomeres (the ends of linear chromosomes) end with a microsatellite hexanucleotide repeat of the sequence (TTAGGG)n.\\r\\nTandem repeats of longer sequences (arrays of repeated sequences 10ÿ60 nucleotides long) are termed minisatellites.\\r\\nTransposable genetic elements, DNA sequences that can replicate and insert copies of themselves at other locations within a host genome, are an abundant component in the human genome. The most abundant transposon lineage, Alu, has about 50,000 active copies,[51] and can be inserted into intragenic and intergenic regions.[52] One other lineage, LINE-1, has about 100 active copies per genome (the number varies between people).[53] Together with non-functional relics of old transposons, they account for over half of total human DNA.[54] Sometimes called \\"jumping genes\\", transposons have played a major role in sculpting the human genome. Some of these sequences represent endogenous retroviruses, DNA copies of viral sequences that have become permanently integrated into the genome and are now passed on to succeeding generations.\\r\\nMobile elements within the human genome can be classified into LTR retrotransposons (8.3% of total genome), SINEs (13.1% of total genome) including Alu elements, LINEs (20.4% of total genome), SVAs and Class II DNA transposons (2.9% of total genome).\\r\\nWith the exception of identical twins, all humans show significant variation in genomic DNA sequences. The human reference genome (HRG) is used as a standard sequence reference.\\r\\nThere are several important points concerning the human reference genome:\\r\\nMost studies of human genetic variation have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are substitutions in individual bases along a chromosome. Most analyses estimate that SNPs occur 1 in 1000 base pairs, on average, in the euchromatic human genome, although they do not occur at a uniform density. Thus follows the popular statement that \\"we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9% the same\\",[55] although this would be somewhat qualified by most geneticists. For example, a much larger fraction of the genome is now thought to be involved in copy number variation.[56] A large-scale collaborative effort to catalog SNP variations in the human genome is being undertaken by the International HapMap Project.\\r\\nThe genomic loci and length of certain types of small repetitive sequences are highly variable from person to person, which is the basis of DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. The heterochromatic portions of the human genome, which total several hundred million base pairs, are also thought to be quite variable within the human population (they are so repetitive and so long that they cannot be accurately sequenced with current technology). These regions contain few genes, and it is unclear whether any significant phenotypic effect results from typical variation in repeats or heterochromatin.\\r\\nMost gross genomic mutations in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, a number of human diseases are related to large-scale genomic abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, and a number of other diseases result from nondisjunction of entire chromosomes. Cancer cells frequently have aneuploidy of chromosomes and chromosome arms, although a cause and effect relationship between aneuploidy and cancer has not been established.\\r\\nWhereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome.[57][58]\\r\\nAn example of a variation map is the HapMap being developed by the International HapMap Project. The HapMap is a haplotype map of the human genome, \\"which will describe the common patterns of human DNA sequence variation.\\"[59] It catalogs the patterns of small-scale variations in the genome that involve single DNA letters, or bases.\\r\\nResearchers published the first sequence-based map of large-scale structural variation across the human genome in the journal Nature in May 2008.[60][61] Large-scale structural variations are differences in the genome among people that range from a few thousand to a few million DNA bases; some are gains or losses of stretches of genome sequence and others appear as re-arrangements of stretches of sequence. These variations include differences in the number of copies individuals have of a particular gene, deletions, translocations and inversions.\\r\\nSingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not occur homogeneously across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 by the end of the first quarter of 2001.[62]\\r\\nChanges in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.\\r\\nA personal genome sequence is a (nearly) complete sequence of the chemical base pairs that make up the DNA of a single person. Because medical treatments have different effects on different people due to genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the analysis of personal genomes may lead to personalized medical treatment based on individual genotypes.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe first personal genome sequence to be determined was that of Craig Venter in 2007. Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples. That sequence was derived from the DNA of several volunteers from a diverse population.[63] However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort the decision was made to switch from sequencing a composite sample to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome.[64] In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released,[65] including those of Desmond Tutu,[66][67] and of a Paleo-Eskimo.[68] In November 2013, a Spanish family made their personal genomics data publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The work was led by Manuel Corpas and the data obtained by direct-to-consumer genetic testing with 23andMe and the Beijing Genomics Institute). This is believed to be the first such public genomics dataset for a whole family.[69]\\r\\nThe sequencing of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity that had not been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings.[70] Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.[71]\\r\\nIn humans, gene knockouts naturally occur as heterozygous or homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts. These knockouts are often difficult to distinguish, especially within heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. They are also difficult to find as they occur in low frequencies.\\r\\nPopulations with high rates of consanguinity, such as countries with high rates of first-cousin marriages, display the highest frequencies of homozygous gene knockouts. Such populations include Pakistan, Iceland, and Amish populations. These populations with a high level of parental-relatedness have been subjects of human knock out research which has helped to determine the function of specific genes in humans. By distinguishing specific knockouts, researchers are able to use phenotypic analyses of these individuals to help characterize the gene that has been knocked out.\\r\\nKnockouts in specific genes can cause genetic diseases, potentially have beneficial effects, or even result in no phenotypic effect at all. However, determining a knockouts phenotypic effect and in humans can be challenging. Challenges to characterizing and clinically interpreting knockouts include difficulty calling of DNA variants, determining disruption of protein function (annotation), and considering the amount of influence mosaicism has on the phenotype. [73]\\r\\nOne major study that investigated human knockouts is the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction study. It was found that individuals possessing a heterozygous loss-of-function gene knockout for the APOC3 gene had lower triglycerides in the blood after consuming a high fat meal as compared to individuals without the mutation. However, individuals possessing homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts of the APOC3 gene displayed the lowest level of triglycerides in the blood after the fat load test, as they produce no functional APOC3 protein. [74]\\r\\nMost aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) factors. Some inherited variation influences aspects of our biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease in combination with the appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.[75]\\r\\nDisease-causing mutations in specific genes are usually severe in terms of gene function, and are fortunately rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they constitute a significant component of known medical conditions, especially in pediatric medicine. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified, currently there are approximately 2,200 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database.[75]\\r\\nStudies of genetic disorders are often performed by means of family-based studies. In some instances population based approaches are employed, particularly in the case of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a geneticist-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the Human Genome Project are likely to provide increased availability of genetic testing for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment. Parents can be screened for hereditary conditions and counselled on the consequences, the probability it will be inherited, and how to avoid or ameliorate it in their offspring.\\r\\nAs noted above, there are many different kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e. has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.\\r\\nWith the advent of the Human Genome and International HapMap Project, it has become feasible to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between genomic sequence variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders per se as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder. The categorized table below provides the prevalence as well as the genes or chromosomes associated with some human genetic disorders.\\r\\nComparative genomics studies of mammalian genomes suggest that approximately 5% of the human genome has been conserved by evolution since the divergence of extant lineages approximately 200 million years ago, containing the vast majority of genes.[77][78] The published chimpanzee genome differs from that of the human genome by 1.23% in direct sequence comparisons.[79] Around 20% of this figure is accounted for by variation within each species, leaving only ~1.06% consistent sequence divergence between humans and chimps at shared genes.[80] This nucleotide by nucleotide difference is dwarfed, however, by the portion of each genome that is not shared, including around 6% of functional genes that are unique to either humans or chimps.[81]\\r\\nIn other words, the considerable observable differences between humans and chimps may be due as much or more to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there has been found to be a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make up as much as 5 ÿ 15% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same protein translation as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a fusion product of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13.[82] (later renamed to chromosomes 2A and 2B, respectively).\\r\\nHumans have undergone an extraordinary loss of olfactory receptor genes during our recent evolution, which explains our relatively crude sense of smell compared to most other mammals. Evolutionary evidence suggests that the emergence of color vision in humans and several other primate species has diminished the need for the sense of smell.[83]\\r\\nIn September 2016, scientists reported that, based on human DNA genetic studies, all non-Africans in the world today can be traced to a single population that exited Africa between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago.[84]\\r\\nThe human mitochondrial DNA is of tremendous interest to geneticists, since it undoubtedly plays a role in mitochondrial disease. It also sheds light on human evolution; for example, analysis of variation in the human mitochondrial genome has led to the postulation of a recent common ancestor for all humans on the maternal line of descent (see Mitochondrial Eve).\\r\\nDue to the lack of a system for checking for copying errors, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage.[85] Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA (for example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of your 32 ancestors contributed to your mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal you would expect that ~3% of your autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet you would have a ~97% chance to have no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA).\\r\\nEpigenetics describes a variety of features of the human genome that transcend its primary DNA sequence, such as chromatin packaging, histone modifications and DNA methylation, and which are important in regulating gene expression, genome replication and other cellular processes. Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression and one of the most highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.[86][87]\\r\\nEpigenetic patterns can be identified between tissues within an individual as well as between individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their epigenetic state are called epialleles. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individuals genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the epigenetic state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome. Such studies establish epigenetics as an important interface between the environment and the genome.[88]","input":"How many chromosomes are in the human genome?"},{"output":"Rs7,593 in 2013","context":"India's per capita income (nominal) was Rs7,593 in 2013, ranked at 112th out of 164 countries by the World Bank,[1] while its per capita income on purchasing power parity (PPP) basis was US$5,350, and ranked 106th.[2] Other estimates for per capita Gross National Income and Gross Domestic Product vary by source. For example, India's average GDP per capita on PPP basis in 2009, according to The Economist, was US$5,138, with significant variation among its states and union territories. Goa had the highest per capita PPP GDP at US$4903, while Bihar the lowest with per capita PPP GDP of US$682 as of 2015 [3] In rupee terms, India's Per capita income grew by 10.4% to reach Rs.74,920 in 2013-14.\\r\\nWhile India's per capita incomes were low, the average household size and consequent household incomes were higher. India had a total of 247 million households in 2011, with an average of about 4.9 people per household, according to Census of India.[4]\\r\\nEstimates for average household income and the size of India's middle income households vary by source. Using World Bank's definition of middle income families to be those with per capita income between $10 to $50 per day,[5] the National Council of Applied Economic Research[6] of India completed a survey and concluded there were 153 million people who belonged to middle income group in 2006. In contrast, Meyer and Birdsall and Tim Light used a different survey and estimated the number of Middle Income population to be about 70 million in 2009-2010.[7] These groups as well as the World Bank estimated in their 2011 reports that if India's economy continues to grow per projections, India's middle income group would double by 2015 over 2010 levels, and grow by an additional 500 million people by 2025. This would make it, with China, the world's largest middle income market.[8]\\r\\nCompared to other countries, income inequality in India is relatively small as measured by Gini coefficient. India had a Gini coefficient of 32.5 in year 1999- 2000;[9] India's nominal Gini index rose to 36.8 in 2005, while real Gini after tax remained nearly flat at 32.6.[10]\\r\\nStates of India have significant disparities in their average income.[11] Bihar was by far the poorest in India, and per capita income was low in its neighbouring states, along with Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland.[12] The higher income states include Goa, Delhi, Haryana, Sikkim, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Kerala.[13][14][15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLike in other countries, cities provide comparatively a better standard of living.\\r\\nTowns and cities make more than two thirds of the Indian GDP, even though less than a third of the population live in them.[17]\\r\\nIndia has a high rate of migration from rural areas to urban cities. A major reason for the massive migration to cities was the Partition of India. More than half of the refugees from Pakistan settled in urban areas such as Delhi.[18] It is estimated that up to 590 million people, or 40% of the Indian population will be living in cities by 2030, much higher than the current 28%. Also, it is estimated that six states, including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and Punjab will have more than half of their total population living in Urban areas by 2030.[19]\\r\\nIn India, urban areas have seen a much higher growth rate as compared to rural areas. Despite up to three-fourths of the population living in rural areas, rural areas contribute to only one-third of the national income.The main reason for rural India's poor performance in terms of income is the fact that rural India is mostly dependent on agriculture. The agriculture sector in India grew at a rate of only 1.6% in 2008-09,[20] while the Indian Economy grew at a rate of 6.7%, despite the 2008 Financial Crisis.[21] An extremely slow rate of growth in the agriculture sector of the Indian economy has serious implications for the rural-urban divide, both in terms of income and GDP. Some estimates say that the average income of a person living in an urban area may be up to 4 times higher than that of a person living in a rural area.[22] The rising levels of urbanisation in India is a major reason for the rising levels of income disparity in the country.\\r\\nBridging the Urban-Rural Gap\\r\\nIn India, the government has taken steps to bridge the urban-rural gap. This includes setting up the Council for Advancement of People's Action and Rural Technology (CAPART) by the Ministry of Rural Development.[23] CAPART helps in providing assistance to various organisations which help in developmental activities.[24] There is a constantly widening rift between rural and urban India, not only in terms of income, but other social measures. There is an urgent need to strengthen the agriculture sector in India, bring about reforms in labour laws, and provide education.[25]\\r\\nThe Economic Survey of India 2007 by OECD concluded\\r\\nAt the state level, economic performance is much better in states with a relatively liberal regulatory environment than in the relatively more restrictive states\\".[17]\\r\\nThe analysis of this report suggests that the differences in economic performance across states are associated with the extent to which states have introduced market-oriented reforms. Thus, further reforms on these lines, complemented with measures to improve infrastructure, education and basic services, would increase the potential for growth outside of agriculture and thus boost better-paid employment, which is a key to sharing the fruits of growth and lowering poverty.[17]\\r\\nAbout 27.5% of the population was living below the poverty line in 2004-2005.[26]\\r\\nReforming cumbersome regulatory procedures, improving rural connectivity, establishing law and order, creating a stable platform for natural resource investment that balances business interests with social concerns, and providing rural finance are important.\\r\\nGross Domestic State Product (GSDP) is the state counterpart to a country's gross domestic product (GDP), the most comprehensive measure of national economic activity.

A principal author of this law was Royal S. Copeland, a three-term U.S. Senator from New York.[2] In 1968, the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions were added to the FD&C. Also in that year the FDA formed the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) to incorporate into FD&C regulations the recommendations from a National Academy of Sciences investigation of effectiveness of previously marketed drugs.[3] The act has been amended many times, most recently to add requirements about bioterrorism preparations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe introduction of this act was influenced by the death of more than 100 patients due to a sulfanilamide medication where diethylene glycol was used to dissolve the drug and make a liquid form[4](see elixir sulfanilamide disaster). It replaced the earlier Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FDC Act has ten chapters:[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FD&C is perhaps best known by the consumer because of its use in the naming of food coloring additives, such as \\"FD&C Yellow No. 6.\\" The Act made the certification of some food color additives mandatory. Some food colorings are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and do not require certification.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FDA lists nine FD&C (Food, Drugs & Cosmetics) certified color additives for use in foods in the United States, and numerous D&C (Drugs & Cosmetics) colorings allowed only in drugs for external application or cosmetics. Color additives derived from natural sources, such as vegetables, minerals or animals, and artificial counterparts of natural derivatives, are exempt from certification. Both artificial and naturally derived color additives are subject to rigorous standards of safety before their approval for use in foods.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are also \\"D&C\\" colors that are only approved for use in pharmaceuticals for external application and cosmetics.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FFDCA requires producers of food additives to demonstrate to a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use of an additive. If the FDA finds an additive to be safe the agency issues a regulation specifying the conditions under which the additive may be safely used.\\r\\n\\r\\nA shortened definition of \\"food additive\\" is defined by the FDA as \\"any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristic of any food (including any substance intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food; and including any source of radiation intended for any such use); if such substance is not GRAS or sanctioned prior to 1958 or otherwise excluded from the definition of food additives.\\"[14] The full definition can be found in Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, which provides for any additional exclusions.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHomeopathic preparations are regulated and protected under Sections 201(g) and 201(j), provided that such medications are formulated from substances listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, which the Act recognizes as an official drug compendium.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, under separate authority of FTC Act, the Federal Trade Commission declared in November 2016 that homeopathic products cannot include claims of effectiveness without \\"competent and reliable scientific evidence.\\" If no such evidence exists, they must state this fact clearly on their labeling, and state that the product's claims are based only on 18th-century theories that have been discarded by modern science.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nBottled water is regulated by the FDA as a food. The Agency has published identity standards for types of water (mineral water, spring water), and regulations covering water processing and bottling, water quality and product labeling.[17][18]\\r\\n[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Act defines cosmetics as \\"articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body...for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance.\\" Under the Act, the FDA does not approve cosmetic products, but because the Act prohibits the marketing of adulterated or misbranded cosmetics in interstate commerce, it can remove cosmetics from the market that contain unsafe ingredients or that are mislabeled.  The FDA can and does inspect cosmetics manufacturing facilities to ensure that cosmetics are not adulterated.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 28, 1976, the FD&C Act was amended to include regulation for medical devices.[21] The amendment required that all medical devices be classified into one of three classes:\\r\\n\\r\\nFor devices that were marketed prior to the amendment (Preamendment devices) and were classified as Class III, the amendment obligated the FDA to review the device to either reclassify it as a Class II device subject to premarket notification, or to require the device manufacturer to undergo the premarket authorization process and prove the safety and efficacy of the device in order to continue marketing it. Notable examples of such preamendment devices are those used for electroconvulsive therapy, which the FDA started reviewing in 2011.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 510(k)[24] of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires those device manufacturers who must register to notify FDA, at least 90 days in advance, of their intent to market a medical device.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is known as Premarket Notification, PMN, or 510(k). It allows FDA to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of the three classification categories. Thus, \\"new\\" devices (not in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976) that have not been classified can be properly identified.\\r\\n\\r\\nAny device that reaches market via a 510(k) notification must be \\"substantially equivalent\\" to a device on the market prior to May 28, 1976 (a \\"predicate device\\"). If a device being submitted is significantly different, relative to a pre-1976 device, in terms of design, material, chemical composition, energy source, manufacturing process, or intended use, the device nominally must go through a premarket approval, or PMA. This does not always happen.\\r\\n\\r\\nA device that reaches market via the 510(k) process is not considered to be \\"approved\\" by the FDA. Nevertheless, it can be marketed and sold in the United States. They are generally referred to as \\"cleared\\" or \\"510(k) cleared\\" devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2011 study by Dr. Diana Zuckerman and Paul Brown of the National Research Center for Women and Families, and Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that most medical devices recalled in the last five years for \\"serious health problems or death\\" had been previously cleared by the FDA using the less stringent, and cheaper, 510(k) process. In a few cases the devices had been deemed so low-risk that they did not need FDA regulation. Of the 113 devices recalled, 35 were for cardiovascular issues.[25] This may lead to a reevaluation of FDA procedures and better oversight.\\r\\n\\r\\nPremarket approval (PMA) is the most stringent type of device marketing application required by FDA. Unlike the 510(k) pathway, the maker of the medical device must submit an application to the FDA and must receive approval prior to marketing the device.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PMA application contains information about how the medical device was designed and how it is manufactured, as well as preclinical and clinical studies of the device, demonstrating that it is safe and effective for its intended use.[27] Because the PMA requires a clinical trial it is significantly more expensive than a 510(k).[28]:7\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 created section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, which obligated the FDA to establish a risk-based regulatory system for medical devices.  As a result the FDA established a \\"de novo\\" pathway for devices that would automatically be classified as Class III because there was no already-existing device that could be used a predicate for a 510k submission, but for which general controls or general and special controls could provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Wheeler-Lea Act, passed in 1938, granted the Federal Trade Commission the authority to oversee advertising of all products regulated by FDA, other than prescription drugs.\\r\\n\\r\\nDescriptions of these can be found at the FDA's web site.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmendments:\\r\\n\\r\\nOther laws:[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome US states have adopted the FD&C Act as an equivalent state law and will by default adopt any changes to the Federal law as changes to the state law as well.[citation needed]","input":"Who created the food drug and cosmetic act?"},{"output":"from 1978 to 1982","context":"The Seven Mile Bridge is a famous bridge in the Florida Keys, in Monroe County, Florida, United States.

The modern bridge is open to vehicular traffic; the older one only to pedestrians and cyclists. The older bridge, originally known as the Knights Key-Pigeon Key-Moser Channel-Pacet Channel Bridge, was constructed from 1909 to 1912 under the direction of Henry Flagler and Clarence S. Coe as part of the Florida East Coast Railway's Key West Extension, also known as the Overseas Railroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the railroad was damaged by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, the line was sold to the United States government, which refurbished Seven Mile Bridge for automobile use.

It had a swing span to allow passage of boats in the Moser Channel of the Intracoastal Waterway, near where the bridge crosses Pigeon Key, a small island that held a work camp for Flagler's railroad. Hurricane Donna in 1960 caused further damage.\\r\\nThe current road bridge was constructed from 1978 to 1982.\\r\\nThe vast majority of the original bridge still exists, although the swing span has been removed. The 2.2-mile section to Pigeon Key, used as a fishing pier and long open to motorized vehicles to give access to the key, was closed to motorized traffic in 2008 after the unsupported sections began to sag. As of 2015[update], the section remains open to pedestrians and bicyclists.[2][3] In 2014, Florida Department of Transportation approved a $77 million plan to restore the old bridge.[4]\\r\\nThe new bridge is a box-girder structure built from precast, prestressed concrete sections, comprising 440 spans.

In 2000-09 approximately 3.1 million acres in the US were under rice production, while an increase is expected in the next decade to approximately 3.3 million acres.[1] US Rice represents rice producers in the six largest rice-producing states of Arkansas (The nations's number one rice producer.), California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrican rice (a separate species from Asian rice, originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River[4][5]) was introduced to the United States in the 17th century.

In 1685, a bag of Madagascar rice known as \\"Gold Seede\\" was given to Dr. Henry Woodward. A tax law of 26 September 1691 had permitted payment of taxes by the colonists by way of rice and other commodities.[6] [7]\\r\\nThe colonies of South Carolina and Georgia prospered and amassed great wealth from rice planting, based on the slave labor obtained from the Senegambia area of West Africa and from coastal Sierra Leone. One batch of slaves was advertised as \\"a choice cargo of Windward and Gold Coast Negroes, who have been accustomed to the planting of rice\\". At the port of Charleston, through which 40% of all American slave imports passed, slaves from Africa brought the highest prices in recognition of their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around Georgetown, Charleston, and Savannah.[6]\\r\\nEnslaved Africans cleared the land, diked the marshes and built the irrigation system, skimming the freshwater layer off the high tide, flushing the fields, and adjusting the water level to the development stage of the rice. Rice was planted, hoed, and harvested with hand tools; plows and harvest wains could be pulled by mules or oxen wearing special shoes.[6] At first rice was milled by hand with wooden paddles, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets (the making of which was another skill brought by slaves from Africa). The invention of the rice mill increased profitability of the crop, and the addition of water power for the mills in 1787 by American millwright Jonathan Lucas was another step forward.\\r\\nRice production was not merely unhealthy but lethal. One 18th-century writer wrote:[6]\\r\\nIf a work could be imagined peculiarly unwholesome and even fatal to health, it must be that of standing like the negroes, ankle and mid-leg deep in water which floats an ouzy mud, and exposed all the while to a burning sun which makes the air they breathe hotter than the human blood; these poor wretches are then in a furness of stinking putrid effluvia.\\r\\nInadequate food, housing, and clothing, malaria, yellow fever, venomous snakes, alligators, hard labour, and brutal treatment killed up to a third of Low Country slaves within a year. Not one child in ten lived to age sixteen. However, in the 1770s, a slave could produce rice worth more than six times his or her own market value in a year, so this high death rate was not uneconomical for their owners. Rice plantations could produce profits of up to 26 percent per year. Runaways, on the other hand, were a problem:[6]\\r\\nI gave them a hundred lashes more than a dozen times; but they never quit running away, till I chained them together, with iron collars round their necks, and chained them to spades, and made them do nothing but dig ditches to drain the rice swamps. They could not run away then, unless they went together, and carried their chains and spades with them. I kept them in this way two years....\\r\\nMost plantations were run on the task system, where a slave was given one or more tasks, estimated at ten hours' hard work, each day. After they had finished the tasks to the overseer's satisfaction, they could spend the remainder of the day as they chose, often on growing their food, spinning, sewing their clothes, or building their houses (slaves were typically supplied with nails and five yards of cloth per year). The task system, and the unwillingness of free people to live in rice-growing areas, may have led to the greater survival of African culture among the Gullah.[6]\\r\\nIn the country's early years, rice production was limited to the South Atlantic and Gulf states. For almost the first 190 years of rice production in the US, the principal producers were South Carolina and Georgia. Limited amounts were grown in North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.[9]\\r\\nRice was introduced into the southern states of Louisiana and east Texas in the mid-19th century.[10] Meanwhile, soil fertility in the east fell, especially for inland rice.[6]\\r\\nEmancipation in 1863 freed rice workers. East-coast rice farming required hard, skilled work under extremely unhealthy conditions, and without slave labour, profits fell. Increasing automation in response came too late, and a series of hurricanes that hit Carolina in the late 1800s and damaged levees put an end to the industry. Production shifted to the Deep South,[11] where the geography was more favourable to mechanization.[9]\\r\\nThese events can be seen in rice production statistics. In 1839, the total production was 80,841,422 pounds, of which 60,590,861 pounds were grown in South Carolina and 12,384,732 pounds in Georgia. In 1849, cultivation reached 215,313,497 pounds.[12] Between 1846 and 1861, annual rice production in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia averaged more than 105 million pounds of cleaned rice, with South Carolina producing more than 75 percent.\\r\\nAt the census of 1870, after emancipation, the production of rice decreased to 73,635,021 pounds. In 1879, the total area devoted to rice was 174,173 acres, and the total production of clean rice was up again to 110,131,373 pounds. A decade later, the total area devoted to rice cultivation was 161,312 acres, and the total production of clean rice equaled 128,590,934 pounds; this represented a 16.76 percent increase in the amount produced, with a decrease of 7.38 percent in the area under cultivation.[12]\\r\\nBetween 1890 and 1900, Louisiana and Texas increased rice crop acreage to such an extent that they produced almost 75 percent of the country's product. Between 1866 and 1880, the annual production of the three States averaged just under 41 million pounds, of which South Carolina produced more than 50 percent. After 1880, their average annual production approximated 46 million pounds of cleaned rice, of which North Carolina produced 5.5 million, South Carolina 27 million and Georgia 13.5 million pounds.[9]\\r\\nThe rice industry in Louisiana began around the time of the Civil War. For a number of years, production was small, but during the 1870s the industry began to assume large proportions, averaging nearly 30 million pounds for the decade and exceeding 51 million pounds in 1880. In 1885, the production reached 100 million pounds, and in 1892, 182 million pounds. The great development of the rice industry in Louisiana after 1884 resulted from the opening up of a prairie region in the southwestern part of the state, and the development of a system of irrigation and culture which made possible the use of harvesting machinery similar to that used in the wheat fields of the Northwest, greatly reducing the costs of production. In 1896, yield from the Louisiana rice fields, where harvesting machinery was used, was good. However the milling process was not successful commercially in some rice varieties. The loss due to the milling process was considerable, particularly of the unbroken rice in the \\"head rice\\" variety.[9]\\r\\nRice was established in Arkansas in 1904, California in 1912, and the Mississippi Delta in 1942.[3] Rice cultivation in California in particular started during the California Gold Rush. It was introduced primarily for the consumption of about 40,000 Chinese laborers who were brought as immigrants to the state; only a small area was under rice cultivation to meet this requirement. However, commercial production began only in 1912 in the town of Richvale in Butte County.[13] Since then, California has cultivated rice in a big way, and as of 2006, its production of rice was the second largest in the United States.[14]\\r\\nRice culture in the southeastern U.S. became less profitable with the loss of slave labor after the American Civil War, and it finally died out just after the turn of the 20th century. Today, people can visit the historic Mansfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, the state's only remaining rice plantation with the original mid-19th century winnowing barn and rice mill. The predominant strain of rice in the Carolinas was from Africa and was known as \\"Carolina Gold\\". The cultivar has been preserved and there are current attempts to reintroduce it as a commercially grown crop.[15]\\r\\nIn 1900, the annual production of rice in the US was approximately half the annual consumption. The two principal varieties of lowland rice which were cultivated in the Atlantic States were the \\"gold seed rice\\" and white rice, which were the original rice varieties introduced into the US. Gold seed rice was notable for the larger yield of the grain. It thus practically superseded white rice which was cultivated in the earlier years. Experiments with upland rice demonstrated that it could grow over large areas of the country but the crop's yield and quality are inferior to lowland rice produced by irrigation methods.[9]\\r\\nSince then, California has cultivated rice on a large scale, and as of 2006 its production was the second largest in the United States,[14] after Arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of Sacramento.[16]\\r\\nDuring 2012, the estimated rice production was 199 million cwt, or 19.9 billion lbs. This was a rise of 8% over the production of 2011. The harvested area also recorded a rise from 2.68 million ha in 2012 to 2.7 million ha in 2013. Another record was of the yield during 2012 recorded at 7,449 pounds per acre, higher than the 2011 yield by 382 pounds per acre.[17]\\r\\nSix states now account for over 99% of all rice grown in the US. These are Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. As of 2003, Arkansas topped the list with a production level of 213 million bushels against a total production of 443 million bushels in the country, and the annual per capita consumption reported is in excess of 28 pounds.[18]\\r\\nThe earliest types grown in Carolina were the African Oryza glaberrima, the prized \\"Carolina Gold\\". Asian Oryza sativa was \\"Carolina White\\".[citation needed]\\r\\nAfter the total decline of rice cultivation in Carolina, \\"Carolina Gold\\" is now cultivated in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana.[6]\\r\\nIn California, production is dominated by short and medium grain japonica varieties, including cultivars developed for the local climate such as Calrose, which makes up as much as 85% of the state's crop. The broad classification of rice grown includes Long Grain Rice, Medium Grain Rice and Short Grain Rice.[19]\\r\\nWhile now more than 100 varieties of rice are grown in the world, in the US 20 varieties of rice are commercially produced, primarily in the states of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and California. Primary classification of rice grown are the long, medium or short grain type. The Long Grain Rice is slender and long, the Medium Grain Rice is plump but not round, and the Short Grain Rice is round. The forms of rice are Brown Rice, Parboiled Rice and Regular-Milled White Rice.[18][20]\\r\\nThe domestic utilization of rice in the US is food use (58%), while 16% is used in food and beer processing and 10% is used in pet food.[20]\\r\\nSpecial varieties of rice such as jasmine rice and basmati rice which are of the aromatic variety are imported from Thailand, India, and Pakistan, as such varieties have not been evolved in the US; this demand for import is quite substantial and largely to meet the increasing population of the rice-eating ethnic community.[21]\\r\\nHarvested rice is subject to milling to remove the husk, which encloses the kernel. Before this process is started, the rice from the field is subject to a cleaning process to remove stalks and any extraneous material by means of special machinery. In the case of parboiled rice, a steam pressure process is adopted for milling. After drying, the rice is subjected to further processing to remove the hull and then polished. Brown rice is processed through a shelling machine which removes the hull. The resulting brown rice retains the brawn layer around the kernel. In the case of white rice, the hull and the brawn are removed and polished in a polishing machine, producing a polished kernel.[18]\\r\\nThe first export of rice from Carolina was 5 tons in 1698, which rose to 330 tons by 1700 and jumped to 42,000 tons in 1770. However, as a result of the abolition of slave labour, export from Carolina eventually ceased.[6]\\r\\nWhile the rice production in the US accounts for about 2% of world production, its exports account for about 10% of all exports. The export is mostly of high-quality rice of the long and combined medium/short-grain varieties of rice. The type of rice exported is rough or unmilled rice, parboiled rice, brown rice, and fully milled rice. Exports to Mexico and Central America are mostly of the rough rice variety. Other countries to which the US exports rice include Mexico, Central America, Northeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the Middle East, Canada, the European Union (EU-27), and Sub-Saharan Africa.[21]\\r\\nThe exported variety is free of genetically enhanced (GE) rice. The World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are the agreements under which the US exports its rice and this has resulted in an increase of exports from the country since the 1990s.[21]\\r\\nA popular festival observed on New Year's Day, by many Americans (mostly from the southern states) is the preparation and consuming of a rice cuisine called the \\"Hoppin' John\\". Since rice is associated with slave labour as their staple diet (with horse-beans[clarification needed] made in to a pulp by boiling; boiled yams and occasionally a small amount of beef or pork) it is eaten in the US on New Year's Day in the belief that it brings good luck since people who \\"eat poor New Year's Day, eat rich the rest of the year.\\"[6]\\r\\nThe International Rice Festival is held every year in Crowley, Louisiana on Friday and Saturday of the third weekend in October. It is the largest and oldest agricultural festival of Louisiana. The festival is a celebration of rice as a staple food and its economic importance in the world.[22] The tradition was set in 1927 as a Rice Carnival by Sal Right, a pioneer of the rice industry. However, the celebration of this festival in Crowley is also attributed to Harry D Wilson, Commissioner of Agriculture. It is also said that the festival was the idea of the Governor to celebrate the festival on the occasion of the silver jubilee of establishment of the city of Crowley on 25 October 1937.[23]","input":"What state produces the most rice in the us?"},{"output":"Udant Martand","context":"Udant Martand (The Rising Sun) was the first Hindi language newspaper published in India. Started on May 30, 1826, from Calcutta (now Kolkata), the weekly newspaper was published every Tuesday by Pt. Jugal Kishore Shukla.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 19th?century, educational publications in Hindi had already started, thus journalism was only a matter time. By the 1820s, newspapers in several Indian languages were starting, including Bengali and Urdu; however, printing in Devanagari script was still rare. Soon after Calcutta School Book started printing, Samachar Darpan, a Bengali journal which started in 1819, had some portions in Hindi. However, Hindi reading audience base was still at a nascent stage. Thus few of the early attempts were successful, but they nevertheless were a start.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nShukla was a lawyer originally from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, who had settled in Calcutta,[4] and became Proceedings Reader at the Sadr Diwani Adalat (Civil and Revenue High Court), and later on a pleader.[5][6] On February 16, 1826, he along with Munnu Thakur of Banstala Gali, Calcutta, received a license to publish a newspaper in Hindi.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newspaper was started on May 30, 1826; with it for the first time a newspaper was published completely in Hindi, using Devanagari script. Udant Martand employed a mix of Khari Boli and Braj Bhasha dialects of Hindi.[5][8] The first issue printed 500 copies,[3] and the newspaper was published every Tuesday.[6] The office of newspaper was at 37, Amartalla Lane, Kolutolla, near Barabazar Market in Kolkata.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to its distance from the Hindi-speaking areas of North India, the newspaper had difficulty in finding subscribers.[6] The publisher tried to get government subscription, and patronage in the form of postal fee exemption for eight newspapers to be posted to North India. However, it didn't receive the subscription and only one newspaper was allowed postal fee exemption, which meant that the paper could never be financially viable.[6] Nevertheless, it briefly gained prominence for featuring the controversy that rose Bengali-language magazine, Samachar Chandrika and traders from interiors, who were based in Calcutta.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever soon due to higher postal rates as well as distant readership, the newspaper ran into financial difficulties. The publication expected some funding from the government, which didn't come through, and eventually closed on December 4, 1827.[1][4][10] A year later in 1828, government withdrew government subscription for newspapers, started during the liberal period of  Governor-General Lord William Bentinck, which led to several small newspapers closing.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany years later in 1850, Shukla also started a magazine, Samdand Martand,[1] which ran till 1929.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, \\"Hindi Journalism Day\\" or 'Hindi Patrakarita Diwas is celebrated on 30 May each year, as it marked the \\"beginning to journalism in Hindi language\\".[12]","input":"Which is the india's first news paper?"},{"output":"a special stationary exercise bicycle with a weighted flywheel","context":"Indoor cycling, as an organized activity, is a form of exercise with classes focusing on endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity (race days) and recovery, and involves using a special stationary exercise bicycle with a weighted flywheel in a classroom setting. It is commonly called spinning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nClasses generally use specialized stationary bicycles. Features include a mechanical device to modify the difficulty of pedalling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle to a range of riders. Many have a weighted flywheel, which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with toe clips as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have clipless receptacles for use with cleated cycling shoes. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.\\r\\nIf the exercise is not done correctly or the rider's position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort it is important to make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward.[1][2] This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.\\r\\nA typical class involves a single instructor at the front of the class who leads the participants through routines that are designed to simulate terrain and situations similar to riding a bike outdoors. Some of the movements and positions include hill climbs, sprints and interval training. A well-trained instructor uses music, motivation, visualization and enthusiastic coaching to lead students through a ride that best suits their fitness level and goals. Most instructors will lead what is called an interval ride, where students will sprint, run, climb, and jump all in the same ride, but there will not be definable pattern to the exercises. In the early 2000s, \\"terrain-based\\" classes that simulate outdoor conditions (e.g., wind resistance) were introduced. Terrain-based classes are designed to improve a rider's outdoor skill set and increase endurance while providing an intense cardio-based workout.\\r\\nParticipants set goals based on their heart rate, which can be measured by hand or using a heart rate monitor and ride simulated variations in terrain by altering resistance and cadence. Some participants choose to maintain a moderate, aerobic intensity level, with a heart rate of between 50 and 85% of max while others drive their heart rates higher in intervals of anaerobic activity to levels of between 85 and 92%.\\r\\nOne of the major advantages of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants can judge their level of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses to work with the instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.[3]\\r\\nBesides burning (on average) between 300-500 kcal in 60 minutes,[4] indoor cycling also strengthens the muscles of the lower body. It tones the quadriceps and hamstrings, along with working the back and hips. It can be difficult to stay at the moderate level in a class that is geared towards more intensity. The difficulty of the workout is modulated in two ways:\\r\\nThere are five core movements in the Spinning programme.\\r\\nThese five movements each work a different part of the body and focus on different leg muscle groups. The rider should always maintain control of the flywheel by having resistance applied and remaining below a cadence of 110 RPM. Not all bikes have a freewheel, or 'smart release', and it is possible that the flywheel will 'run away' with the rider with the potential for causing injury. The rider should be able to maintain perfectly even pedal rotations at high resistance. This becomes difficult below 60 RPM cadence and failing to make 'perfect circles' increases the risk of knee and hip injury. A road cyclist will normally have a natural pedal cadence, of about 85 RPM and will control changes in terrain by changing gear to maintain this rate. The goal of the spinning programme is not to exceed this natural rate by more than 25 RPM higher (110 RPM) or lower (60 RPM)\\r\\nThere are five further advanced movements based on those listed above.\\r\\nMost indoor cycling classes are coached with music. Riders may synchronize their pedalling to be in time with the rhythm of the music, thus providing an external stimulus to encourage a certain tempo. Often, the music chosen by the instructor is dance music or rock music set to a dance beat (i.e. 4/4 time), but not necessarily. This tends to help motivate participants to work harder than they might otherwise. The instructor also may choose specific songs for sprints, climbs, and jumps. While the music provides a tempo cue, the cadence does not need to be a multiple of the beat in order for the rider to feel in rhythm; the music therefore helps a rider maintain any constant cadence, not just a cadence that matches the beat. It may depend on the level of exertion whether or not someone changes position or the instructor can tell the class to change.\\r\\nA variation known as \\"aqua cycling\\" or \\"hydrospinning\\" also exists. In this, the stationary bicycles are underwater in a pool.[5][6]\\r\\nSpinning on rollers\\r\\nStationary bicycle trainer\\r\\nSpinning driving wheel\\r\\n\\"Out for a spin\\", c. 1880.

Hanna is thrilled that Spencer approves of Mona, and they consider letting her join their clique.\\r\\n\\"A\\" tells Aria that Meredith has a secret job at Hooters, and she goes there with Mike, only to discover that \\"A\\" was lying. Darren Wilden and several other cops are there, and Aria is tempted to tell them about \\"A\\". When Mike realizes that something is troubling his sister, he urges her to tell Darren, and she eventually does. On the night of Hanna's party, Aria tells Jenna what happened the night she was blinded and apologizes for not stopping Alison, but Jenna reveals that she and Alison had planned it together to get rid of Toby. Aria asks Jenna about \\"A\\", but Jenna becomes scared and quickly leaves, hinting that she knows who \\"A\\" is.\\r\\nMelissa confronts Spencer about seeing Ian behind her back, which Spencer denies, and when she leaves, Spencer and Mona discover another note from \\"A\\" and suspect that Melissa killed Alison because she was jealous of her relationship with Ian. They inform the others, and decide to turn Melissa in. Mona drives Spencer to the police station, and Aria tells Emily and Hanna the truth about The Jenna Thing. When Hanna says that one in four boys sexually abuse their sister, Emily tells her not to believe everything she hears, which causes Hanna's memory to return, and she is horrified when she remembers who \\"A\\" is: Mona.\\r\\nSpencer is hesitant about turning in Melissa, but Mona comforts her and convinces her otherwise. Moments later, Spencer receives a text from Emily, telling her that Mona is \\"A\\". When she receives several more from the girls, who are worrying about what Mona will do, Mona realizes that they finally figured it out. While Aria, Emily and Hanna go to the police station to tell Darren that Mona is \\"A\\", Mona drives Spencer to Floating Man's Quarry, where she explains that she saw what happened on the night of The Jenna Thing, and when Maya moved in, she found Alison's diary, which contained the girls' secrets. Using the information to her advantage, she got a new phone and became \\"A\\" to get revenge on the girls for blinding Jenna. Spencer accuses Mona of killing Alison, but Mona says that it was Ian who killed her, as Alison had blackmailed him about their relationship.\\r\\nSpencer secretly calls Darren, who overhears her conversation with Mona and learns of their location. Mona tells Spencer that she originally planned to frame her for Alison's murder, but recently grew to like her, and thus decided to frame Melissa to do Spencer a favor. She then offers Spencer her life in return that she becomes \\"A\\" with her, as they could pin the blame on someone else. Spencer refuses and Mona attacks her. They fight on the cliff's edge, and in the struggle, Spencer accidentally pushes Mona off the cliff to her death. Aria, Emily and Hanna arrive on the scene with Darren and police, and find Mona's body and an unconscious Spencer.\\r\\nEmily finds herself confused about her sexuality once again, as she now has feelings for a boy she met at church, Christian singer Isaac. Emily tries to date Isaac without him finding out about her orientation, though \\"A\\" keeps interfering. Emily tells Isaac about Maya and he then hugs her and tell her that he accepts her for who she is.\\r\\nHanna, still overcome with shock after discovering Mona Vanderwaal was really \\"A\\", can't seem to catch a break. She now has trouble with her stepsister Kate Randall. At a party at a hotel opening, Hanna and Kate continue to fight over title of \\"Queen Bee\\". Hanna and Lucas break up after Hanna tells everyone that Kate has herpes at a party to sabotage her. Eventually, Hanna's father forbids her from talking to anyone except Kate.\\r\\nAria has feelings for a man, Xavier, who she met at an art show; however, he ends up meeting and dating her mother through an online match site. This puts her at risk of hurting her mother again and further damaging their newly repaired relationship. Aria moves in with Meredith and Byron to avoid Xavier as his true intentions will jeopardize Aria and Ella's relationship.\\r\\nAfter a shock at her gran's will reading and her family neglecting her, Spencer comes to believe that she is adopted and starts searching a reuniting website for answers.\\r\\nIn the end, Spencer, Emily, Aria, and Hanna find Ian's body in the woods behind Spencer's house, but when they return with the police, the body is missing. Wilden sort of pushes it off, and begins the search hours after the girls had shared their story.\\r\\nSpencer meets a woman named Olivia Caldwell who she thinks is her real mother, and attempts to move to New York, but it turns out to be a scam and she loses her college money.\\r\\nHanna and Kate compete for the affections of Aria's brother Mike Montgomery.\\r\\nAria falls in love with Jason DiLaurentis again.\\r\\nEmily has sex with her new boyfriend Isaac, whose mother finds out and banishes Emily from their house without Isaac knowing. At the opening party for Radley, a former so-called \\"haven for troubled youth\\", Emily finds proof that Jason DiLaurentis had been a patient there, and soon Hanna, Aria, and Emily all come to believe that Jason and Darren Wilden had something to do with Ali's murder.\\r\\nIan Thomas confirms their suspicions about Darren and Jason right before someone sets the woods behind Spencer's house to fire. Although at first they had their doubts about Ian being alive, they are now confident he is.\\r\\nWhile Aria is trying to get to Spencer's barn to show them Ali's flag from 6th grade, she finds someone caught in the woods because of the fire, saves this person, and then they all recognize her as Ali.\\r\\n\\"A\\" sends Emily to Lancaster, where Emily comes to believe that Ali was not the girl in the hole, but that Wilden has murdered a girl named Leah and covered it up by making it seem like it was Ali.\\r\\nAria begins a relationship with Noel Kahn, after he defends her at a party. She visits a medium, who produces a message in Ali's handwriting that states that \\"Ali killed Ali.\\" This leads her to believe that Ali might have committed suicide.\\r\\nHanna's father sends her to a clinic to prevent her eating disorder from reappearing due to stress, where she befriends a troubled girl named Iris. Hanna has more dreams about Ali, which causes her to suspect that Iris had something to do with Ali's death.\\r\\n\\"A\\" reveals to Spencer that her father had an affair (and that Alison is Spencer's half-sister), making her suspicious of her mother.\\r\\nThe Liars are arrested for Ali's murder. They realize that \\"A\\" has tricked each of them into believing someone else killed Ali. However, a man named Billy Ford is soon arrested for murdering Alison and Jenna Cavanaugh. Everyone now believes Ian is dead.\\r\\nOn the way there, Spencer gets a frantic call from her mother telling her that Melissa has disappeared. Spencer had begun to believe that her sister was the one who killed Ali and that she may be after the rest of them, but once they arrive at the house it's revealed that Ali is the killer. They discover that the girl they were friends with years ago was actually Courtney, and the real Ali was stuck in an institution. She had killed Courtney for ruining her life, attempted to kill the girls in the forest fire, tried to have them arrested, and is now going to kill them by setting the house on fire.\\r\\nThey're able to escape after stumbling onto Ian's body hidden in a closet and releasing a bound Melissa, who Ali had kidnapped and was planning to kill as well. Ali is trapped inside the house and it's assumed she died in the fire, although her body is never found.\\r\\nAfter learning that her ex-husband shipped Hanna off to a mental institution, Ashley Marin transfers back to Rosewood and kicks Hanna's father, Isabel and Kate out of the house, thrilling Hanna. Hanna and Mike get back together.\\r\\nMeredith goes into labor, giving birth to a girl named Lola. Aria and Noel get back together after it is revealed that Ali kissed him, not the other way around, and Ella breaks up with Xavier after learning of his inappropriate behavior towards Aria.\\r\\nSpencer's father proclaims that even though he and her mother may not get back together, things are going to change for the better in their family, and Spencer and Melissa grow closer after almost being killed.\\r\\nEmily buries everything she can find that reminds her of Ali at Courtney's grave, hoping she can finally find closure, but is unsure of whether the noises she hears at the cemetery are real or imagined. And somewhere, a new girl starts her senior year at an anonymous school, a girl whose name just so happens to be an anagram of Alison DiLaurentis. The reader is left wondering if Alison is alive.\\r\\nIn the meantime, Noel, Aria's boyfriend, has an exchange student, from Finland, come to live with him. Instead of being the nerdy boy, Klaudius, that Noel expected, the exchange student turns out to be a gorgeous blonde, Klaudia, who tries to steal Noel from Aria. Aria ends up accidentally pushing Klaudia off of a ski lift as an act of self-defense; however, Klaudia uses that information against Aria. By that point, Aria and Noel's relationship is shaky and uncertain.\\r\\nEmily meets a new girl, Chloe, who moves into the Cavanaugh's old house. They immediately become good friends, bonding over Chloe's baby sister, Grace. Emily has now given up hope of getting a swim scholarship, her only option for college. Chloe's dad offers to help but also hits on Emily, even making sexual moves towards her. Chloe walks in on her dad kissing Emily, but thinks that it's Emily who is wrecking her family (her father had previously been cheating).\\r\\nHanna's dad runs for senator of Pennsylvania. Patrick, somebody who's helping out at the set, offers Hanna a modeling job, but he takes some naughty pictures and threatens her with them, saying he will release them to the public and ruin her dads' chances of becoming senator, unless she gives him $10,000. Hanna steals money from her dad and frames Jeremiah, a mean man who is also working on set.\\r\\nSpencer's mom has begun to date Nicholas Pennythistle, the father of snobby Amelia and her brother Zach, in whom Spencer develops a romantic interest. When they go out dancing, she kisses him, only to find out Zach is gay. When the Hastings and Pennythistles travel to New York together, Spencer and Zach drunkenly fall asleep in the same bed. During the night, Spencer had kicked off her clothes because she was hot, leaving her in her blouse and underwear. The next morning Mr. Pennythistle wakes them both up by entering the room. Their indecent clothing and close proximity leads Mr. Pennythistle to believe that they had slept together and acts violent. Spencer tells him that Zach didn't touch her and that he's gay, hoping to help, but Mr. Pennythistle becomes furious and sends Zach to military school. Zach and Spencer's friendship ends, Zach leaving Spencer with the words \\"Rot in hell, bitch\\".\\r\\nThe girls start to get messages from a new \\"A\\", and believe it's Ali and that she somehow survived the fall from the building. In the end of the book, the news turns on and a teenage girl's dead body was found floating in the water in Jamaica. They identify this girl as Tabitha Clark from New Jersey. The cops believe her death was a tragic accident - not a murder. The girls realize they killed an innocent girl.\\r\\nEmily accidentally meets Kelsey at a party and is instantly smitten with her. She and Kelsey grow close, much to Spencer's disapproval. After Emily is hurt by Spencer's remarks about her love for Alison, she angrily tells Kelsey that Spencer framed her for the drug possession. Depressed, Kelsey overdoses and attempts to throw herself into the quarry where Mona died, but Emily saves her and Kelsey is sent to the Preserve for treatment. While visiting Kelsey, the girls realize that Tabitha was also a patient at the Preserve and was the same age as Alison and Courtney.\\r\\nHanna's father asks her to help with the social media aspect of his campaigning. She meets a boy named Liam, who she falls for, despite knowing he is the son of her father's political opponent. They break up when she learns he has been seeing multiple other girls while dating her, and reconciles with Mike.\\r\\nAfter Aria is dumped by Noel, she seeks out comfort in Ezra, in hopes of rekindling their romance. However, things are strained between them, and Aria eventually goes back into a relationship with Noel, after discovering Ezra and Klaudia being intimate.\\r\\nThe Liars attempt to circumvent \\"A's\\" threats by coming clean about their secrets, with varied success. Meanwhile, \\"A\\" becomes more violent, shoving Emily down a hill at Stockbridge trail. \\"A\\" sends Spencer an email of Tabitha on the beach with a head injury, indicating that \\"A\\" was the one who disposed of Tabitha's body. \\"A\\" taunts the Liars, stating they will never discover \\"A's\\" true identity. Kelsey cannot be A. Emily and Spencer have their biggest rivalry.\\r\\nSpencer visits Princeton hoping to join an Eating Club, but \\"A\\" interferes and spikes Spencer's pot brownies with LSD and Ritalin.\\r\\nAria panics when she finds out Noel's father is a drag queen and ends up putting her relationship with Noel at risk when \\"A\\" threatens Aria to expose Noel's father photo publicly.\\r\\nOn a tip from \\"A\\", Hanna begins spying on Mike's new girlfriend, Colleen. Later she becomes publicly humiliated by \\"A\\" when she sends everybody a video of Hanna stalking Colleen, and her desperate ways of getting Mike back.\\r\\nGayle is murdered by \\"A\\" and it is revealed that she was Tabitha's stepmother. Tabitha's father speaks at Gayle's funeral, and announces that Tabitha's autopsy showed no trace of alcohol, meaning that she was murdered. He thus plans to re-open the investigation into her death, and threatens the killer that he will find him, both Gayle's and Tabitha's killer. The girls get very nervous about this.\\r\\nAfter an explosion on the boat, the Liars go off on their own to bury \\"evidence\\" of their connection to Tabitha (Tabitha's locket, which \\"A\\" had planted for Noel to find). \\"A\\" tampers with their lifeboat, nearly stranding them in the middle of the ocean. The near-death experience pushes the girls into wanting to confess about killing Tabitha. However, as they make plans to come clean about everything, they discover that they were not responsible for Tabitha's death at all: She had been bludgeoned to death by \\"A\\".\\r\\nThe Liars finally come to believe that \\"A\\" is, in fact, Alison, as Emily reveals that she may have helped Alison escape the burning Poconos house in Wanted. Suspiciously though Naomi was at Gayle's funeral.\\r\\nSet between Unbelievable and Wicked, the book is told from the point of view of the second \\"A\\", Alison DiLaurentis, as she spies on the girls during their Christmas vacation. The novel is divided into a series of four short stories, with each one focusing on the exploits of a specific girl.\\r\\nSpencer: Spencer and her family go to Nana Hastings mansion in Florida, and Spencer falls in love with a tennis player named Colin at the country club. Melissa seems to be helping Spencer win Colin's heart, but Colin ends up taking an interest in Melissa. During the trip, Spencer and her mother also run into Mrs. DiLaurentis several times, and Spencer is confused by her mother's strange behavior around Mrs DiLaurentis. Spencer also decides to fight for Colin. After Colin dumps Melissa to go out with her, Spencer and Melissa discover that Colin's actually 33 years old and also has a wife and child. Spencer and Melissa decide to team up to get revenge on Colin by putting crushed Viagra in his Aminospa vitamin water right before his important tennis game. In the end, they all have a fun vacation, but Spencer worries that someone has been following her. Melissa and Spencer seem to briefly make up in this, hence the sisters' wary friendship in Wicked.\\r\\nEmily: Emily is asked to go undercover as Santa Claus at the new mall, in order to catch 4 girls who work as elves there, who are suspected of vandalizing Christmas decorations around town, including Emily's mom's baby Jesus ceramic figure. The 4 girls, who call themselves the \\"Merry Elves\\", take a liking to Emily, and it's revealed that one of the girls, Cassie, was close with Alison. Emily accompanies the girls on their biggest prank yet, but Emily's mom uses her phone to track her, and the Merry Elves get caught. Eventually, the elves forgive Emily after she bails them out of jail. In the end, everyone realizes the true meaning of Christmas, but Emily can't shake off the weird feeling that someone is following her. It is revealed that A is blonde (she will later be revealed as Alison) as Emily sees a blonde figure run off.\\r\\nHanna: Hanna joins a boot camp after thinking she gained too much weight at a holiday party. She develops feelings for the instructor, Vince. She also develops a rival, Dinah, another girl who also likes Vince. After competing for Vince's affection, she and Dinah become friends after catching Kate making out with the mall's new Santa (prior to Emily), something which Hanna also photographs. After agreeing to stop chasing Vince, she celebrates by going out for drinks with Dinah, where Dinah admits she knew Alison. Hanna goes home drunk, causing her to oversleep. As she arrives at boot camp, she discovers Vince and Dinah kissing, revealing that Dinah only pretended to be friends with Hanna to have Hanna let down her guard. Hanna flees the scene, devastated, and is confronted by Kate, who, after receiving a tip-off, followed Hanna around, taking unflattering photos of her at boot camp, which she threatens to put on Facebook. Hanna counterattacks by showing Kate the pictures of her and Santa, causing Kate to back off. Hanna also improves her relationship with her father, who gives Hanna her grandmother's Cartier locket for Christmas. Hanna has a happy Christmas, despite the fact that she thinks someone other than Kate has been watching her every move. Some of what Dinah said may be true such as she knew Alison. But it is likely she made most of it up to get Hanna's trust.\\r\\nAria: Aria goes with her father and Mike to Bear Claw Resort, but leaves to go back home after finding out that Byron invited Meredith along as well. Upon arriving at home, Aria's surprised to see Halbjorn, an old boyfriend of hers from Iceland. Halbjorn tells her that he's running from the Icelandic police who're after him because he protested against the demolition of a puffin sanctuary. Unfortunately, his travel visa only lasts for a week. Aria proposes the idea of marrying him, and the two head off to Atlantic City to elope. At the hotel, they attend a magic show involving two panthers, which greatly angers Halbjorn, who cares a lot about the environment. After getting married the following day, which requires Aria to forge her mother's signature and lie about her age, they go to the place where the panthers are kept. After convincing Halbjorn not to release the panthers, they go back to the hotel. The next morning, Aria wakes up to find Halbjorn gone and his clothes missing as well. On the lobby's TV, Aria sees that Halbjorn ended up releasing the panthers anyway. Aria goes to the courthouse and confesses to lying about her age and forging her mother's signature, making the marriage null and void. Upon returning to Rosewood, she is joined by Mike and Byron, who know nothing about her marriage. As they watch TV, it shows that Halbjorn has been caught, and it also reveals that he's done these sorts of things in the past, including trying to blow up a demolition office. Aria's satisfied with breaking up with him, but is paranoid about someone following her. In Wicked, it's briefly stated that Aria and Meredith did converse about the baby.\\r\\nThe book ends with a sign-off from the new \\"A,\\" (as always) who says that the Liars' lives are going to get a lot worse. All of which comes true...\\r\\nIt's the end of seventh grade, and \\"Alison DiLaurentis\\" and her friends are the alpha girls of Rosewood Day. \\"Ali\\" runs her clique with an iron fist, and she's got enough dirt on Hanna, Emily, Aria and Spencer to keep them in line. But \\"Ali's\\" hiding a dark secret of her own, something so huge it would destroy everything if it ever got out. She's desperate to keep the perfect life she's worked so hard to build, but in Rosewood deadly secrets have deadly consequences.\\r\\nSet in the weeks leading up to \\"Ali's\\" murder, this special Pretty Little Liars tale is told by the prettiest little liar of all: \\"Ali\\" herself. For the first time ever, we see how the mystery beganand how \\"Alison DiLaurentis'\\" life ended.\\r\\nNote: This book is titled Ali's Pretty Little Lies but it's actually about her twin sister, Courtney, who pretended to be Alison because she didn't want to go to a psych ward.

This acid is diprotic (readily ionizes two protons), not triprotic as might be suggested by this formula. Phosphorous acid is an intermediate in the preparation of other phosphorus compounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nH3PO3 is more clearly described with the structural formula HPO(OH)2.  In the solid state, HP(O)(OH)2 is tetrahedral with one shorter P=O bond of 148?pm and two longer PÿO(H) bonds of 154?pm. This species exists in equilibrium with an extremely minor tautomer P(OH)3.  IUPAC recommends that the latter be called phosphorous acid, whereas the dihydroxy form is called phosphonic acid.[2]  Only the reduced phosphorus compounds are spelled with an \\"ous\\" ending.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important oxyacids of phosphorus are phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2). The reduced phosphorus acids are subject to similar tautomerism involving shifts of H between O and P.\\r\\n\\r\\nHPO(OH)2 is the product of the hydrolysis of its acid anhydride:\\r\\n\\r\\n(An analogous relationship connects H3PO4 and P4O10).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn an industrial scale, the acid is prepared by hydrolysis of phosphorus trichloride with water or steam:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPotassium phosphite is also a convenient precursor to phosphorous acid:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice aqueous potassium phosphite is treated with excess hydrochloric acid.  By concentrating the solution and precipitations with alcohols, the pure acid can be separated from the salt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphorous acid is a strong acid with a pKa in the range 1.26ÿ1.3.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a diprotic acid, the hydrogenphosphite ion, HP(O)2(OH)? is a moderately strong acid:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conjugate base HP(O)2(OH)? is called hydrogen phosphite, and the second conjugate base, HPO2?3, is the phosphite ion.[6] (Note that the IUPAC recommendations are hydrogen phosphonate and phosphonate respectively).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hydrogen atom bonded directly to the phosphorus atom is not readily ionizable.  Chemistry examinations often test students' appreciation of the fact that not all three hydrogen atoms are acidic under aqueous conditions, in  contrast with H3PO4.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn heating at 200?C, phosphorous acid disproportionates to phosphoric acid and phosphine:[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reaction is used for laboratory-scale preparations of PH3.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth phosphorous acid and its deprotonated forms are good reducing agents, although not necessarily quick to react. They are oxidized to phosphoric acid or its salts.  It reduces solutions of noble metal cations to the metals.  When phosphorous acid is treated with a cold solution of mercuric chloride, a white precipitate of mercurous chloride forms:\\r\\n\\r\\nMercurous chloride is reduced further by phosphorous acid to mercury on heating or on standing:\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon treatment with metals of d6 configuration, phosphorous acid is known to coordinate as the otherwise rare P(OH)3 tautomer.  Examples include Mo(CO)5(P(OH)3) and [Ru(NH3)4(H2O)(P(OH)3)]2+.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most important use of phosphorous acid (phosphonic acid) is the production of basic lead phosphite, which is a stabilizer in PVC and related chlorinated polymers.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhosphites have shown effectiveness in controlling a variety of plant diseases, in particular, treatment using either trunk injection or foliar containing phosphorous acid salts is indicated in response to infections by phytophthora and pythium-type plant pathogens (both within class oomycetes, known as water molds), such as dieback/root rot and downy mildew.[10] Anti-microbial products containing salts of phosphorous acid are marketed in Australia as 'Yates Anti-Rot'; and in the United States of America, for example, aluminum salts of the monoethyl ester of phosphorous acid (known generically as 'Fosetyl-Al') are sold under the trade name 'Aliette' and potassium salts of phosphorous acid (known generically as potassium phosphite) are sold under the trade name ProPhyt. Phosphorous acid and its salts, unlike phosphoric acid, are somewhat toxic and should be handled carefully.[11][12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe IUPAC (mostly organic) name is phosphonic acid. This nomenclature is commonly reserved for substituted derivatives, that is, organic group bonded to phosphorus, not simply an ester. For example, (CH3)PO(OH)2 is \\"methylphosphonic acid\\", which may of course form \\"methylphosphonate\\" esters.","input":"What is the systematic name for aqueous h3po3?"},{"output":"white stripes","context":"See ?Classification for subspecies.\\r\\nZebras (/?z?br?/ ZEB-r? or /?zi?br?/ ZEE-br?)[1] are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black and white striped coats. Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated.\\r\\nThere are three species of zebras: the plains zebra, the mountain zebra and the Grvy's zebra. The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grvy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass, to which zebras are closely related, while the former two look more horse-like. All three belong to the genus Equus, along with other living equids.\\r\\nThe unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people. They occur in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains, and coastal hills. However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction. Grvy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered. While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, became extinct in the late 19th century ÿ though there is currently a plan, called the Quagga Project, that aims to breed zebras that are phenotypically similar to the quagga in a process called breeding back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name \\"zebra\\" in English dates back to c. 1600, from Italian zebra, perhaps from Portuguese,[2] which in turn is said to be Congolese (as stated in the Oxford English Dictionary). The Encarta Dictionary says its ultimate origin is uncertain, but perhaps it may come from Latin equiferus meaning \\"wild horse\\"; from equus (\\"horse\\") and ferus (\\"wild, untamed\\"). The word was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the 20th century, the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the usual one in the UK and Commonwealth.[3] The pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in the United States.\\r\\nZebras evolved among the Old World horses within the last 4?million years. It has been suggested that zebras are polyphyletic and that striped equids evolved more than once. Extensive stripes are posited to have been of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).[4] However, molecular evidence supports zebras as a monophyletic lineage.[5][6][7] The zebra has between 32 and 46 chromosomes, depending on the species.\\r\\nThere are three extant species. Collectively, two of the species have eight subspecies (seven extant). Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between, and the taxonomic status of, several of the subspecies are not well known.\\r\\nThe plains zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about six subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa. It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the common zebra, the dauw, Burchell's zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's zebra, Wahlberg's zebra, Selous' zebra, Grant's zebra, Boehm's zebra and the quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).\\r\\nThe mountain zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains zebra. It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.\\r\\nGrvy's zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head, making it appear rather mule-like. It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya. Grvy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as endangered.\\r\\nAlthough zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern. Attempts to breed a Grvy's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage. In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse. In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Grvy's zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur.[8]\\r\\nThe common plains zebra is about 1.2ÿ1.3?m (47ÿ51?in) at the shoulder with a body ranging from 2ÿ2.6?m (6.6ÿ8.5?ft) long with a 0.5?m (20?in) tail. It can weigh up to 350?kg (770?lb), males being slightly bigger than females. Grvy's zebra is considerably larger, while the mountain zebra is somewhat smaller.[9]\\r\\nIt was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes, since some zebras have white underbellies. Embryological evidence, however, shows that the animal's background color is black and the white stripes and bellies are additions.[4] It is likely that the stripes are caused by a combination of factors.[10][11][12]\\r\\nThe stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal.\\r\\nA wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the evolution of the striking stripes of zebras. The more traditional of these (1 and 2, below) relate to camouflage.\\r\\nZebras have four gaits: walk, trot, canter and gallop. They are generally slower than horses, but their great stamina helps them outrun predators. When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator to attack. When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.\\r\\nZebras have excellent eyesight. Like most ungulates, the zebra's eyes are on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view. Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators.[citation needed]\\r\\nZebras have excellent hearing and have larger, rounder ears than horses; like other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears in almost any direction. In addition to superb eyesight and hearing, zebras also have acute senses of smell and taste.\\r\\nBeing an equid, zebras are subject to many of the same common infections and diseases of the domestic horse.\\r\\nTwo Grvy's zebras were poisoned in 1995 by leaves from a hybrid red maple tree (acer rubrum) at the St. Louis Zoo. Horses were first reported in 1981 to be susceptible and even a small amount of the leaves can be toxic to ponies. In 2000, a zebra was reported to be infected with a nematode, halicephalobus, usually associated with decaying plant material.[20]\\r\\nLike most members of the horse family, zebras are highly social. Their social structure, however, depends on the species. Mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals. Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion. When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.\\r\\nUnlike the other zebra species, Grvy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds. A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months. The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone. Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.\\r\\nLike horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.\\r\\nZebras communicate with each other with high-pitched barks and whinnying. Grvy's zebras make mulelike brays. A zebra's ears signify its mood. When a zebra is in a calm, tense or friendly mood, its ears stand erect. When it is frightened, its ears are pushed forward. When angry, the ears are pulled backward. When surveying an area for predators, zebras will stand in an alert posture with ears erect, head held high, and staring. When tense, they will also snort. When a predator is spotted or sensed, a zebra will bark (or bray) loudly.\\r\\nZebras feed almost entirely on grasses, but may occasionally eat shrubs, herbs, twigs, leaves and bark. Their digestive systems allow them to subsist on diets of lower nutritional quality than that necessary for other herbivores.\\r\\nFemale zebras mature earlier than the males, and a mare may have her first foal by the age of three. Males are not able to breed until the age of five or six. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. She nurses the foal for up to a year. Like horses, zebras are able to stand, walk and suckle shortly after they are born. A zebra foal is brown and white instead of black and white at birth.\\r\\nPlains and mountain zebra foals are protected by their mothers, as well as the head stallion and the other mares in their group. Grvy's zebra foals have only their mother as a regular protector, since, as noted above, Grvy's zebra groups often disband after a few months.\\r\\nAttempts have been made to train zebras for riding, since they have better resistance than horses to African diseases. Most of these attempts failed, as would have initial attempts to tame wild horses, due to the zebra's more unpredictable nature and tendency to panic under stress. For this reason, zebra-mules or zebroids (crosses between any species of zebra and a horse, pony, donkey or ass) are preferred over purebred zebras.\\r\\nIn England, the zoological collector Walter Rothschild frequently used zebras to draw a carriage. In 1907, Rosendo Ribeiro, the first doctor in Nairobi, Kenya, used a riding zebra for house calls. In the mid-19th century, Governor George Grey imported zebras to New Zealand from his previous posting in South Africa, and used them to pull his carriage on his privately owned Kawau Island.\\r\\nCaptain Horace Hayes, in \\"Points of the Horse\\" (circa 1893), compared the usefulness of different zebra species. In 1891, Hayes broke a mature, intact mountain zebra stallion to ride in two days' time, and the animal was quiet enough for his wife to ride and be photographed upon. He found the Burchell's zebra easy to break, and considered it ideal for domestication, as it was immune to the bite of the tsetse fly. He considered the quagga (now extinct) well-suited to domestication due to being easy to train to saddle and harness.[21]\\r\\nModern man has had great impact on the zebra population. Zebras were, and still are, hunted for their skins, and for meat. They also compete with livestock for forage[22] and are sometimes culled.\\r\\nThe Cape mountain zebra was hunted to near extinction, with less than 100 individuals by the 1930s. The population has since increased to about 700 due to conservation efforts. Both mountain zebra subspecies are currently protected in national parks, but are still endangered.\\r\\nThe Grvy's zebra is also endangered. Hunting and competition from livestock have greatly decreased their population. Because of the population's small size, environmental hazards, such as drought, are capable of affecting the entire species. Plains zebras are much more numerous and have a healthy population. Nevertheless, they too have been reduced by hunting and loss of habitat to farming. One subspecies, the quagga, is now extinct.\\r\\nZebras have been the subject of African folk tales which tell how they got their stripes. According to a San folk tale of Namibia, the zebra was once all white, but acquired its black stripes after a fight with a baboon over a waterhole. After kicking the baboon so hard, the zebra lost his balance and tripped over a fire, and the fire sticks left scorch marks all over his white coat.[23] In the film Fantasia, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse.[24]\\r\\nZebras are a popular subject in art.[25] The fourth Mughal emperor Jahangir (r.1605ÿ24), commissioned a painting of the zebra, which was completed by Ustad Mansur.[26] Zebra stripes are also a popular style for furniture, carpets and fashion.\\r\\nWhen depicted in movies and cartoons, zebras are most often miscellaneous characters, but have had some starring roles, notably in Madagascar, Racing Stripes and Khumba. One of the recurring characters in My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic is a zebra named Zecora. Zebras also serve as mascots and symbols for products and corporations, notably Zebra Technologies and Fruit Stripe gum as well as Investec. Zebras are featured on the coat of arms of Botswana.\\r\\nRecent research has shown that TU-103, a strain of Clostridium bacteria found in zebra feces, can convert nearly any form of cellulose into butanol fuel.[27]","input":"Do zebras have white stripes or black stripes?"},{"output":"a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, between Central Park/Fifth Avenue, 59th Street, the East River, and 96th Street","context":"The Upper East Side is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan in New York City, between Central Park/Fifth Avenue, 59th Street, the East River, and 96th Street.[2] The area incorporates several smaller neighborhoods, including Lenox Hill, Carnegie Hill, and Yorkville. Once known as the Silk Stocking District,[3] it is now one of the most affluent neighborhoods in New York City.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the mouths of streams[5] that eroded gullies in the East River bluffs are conjectured to have been the sites of fishing camps used by the Lenape, whose controlled burns once a generation or so kept the dense canopy of oakÿhickory forest open at ground level.[6]\\r\\nIn the 19th century[7] the farmland and market garden district of what was to be the Upper East Side was still traversed by the Boston Post Road and, from 1837, the New York and Harlem Railroad, which brought straggling commercial development around its one station in the neighborhood, at 86th Street, which became the heart of German Yorkville. The area was defined by the attractions of the bluff overlooking the East River, which ran without interruption from James William Beekman's \\"Mount Pleasant\\", north of the marshy squalor of Turtle Bay, to Gracie Mansion, north of which the land sloped steeply to the wetlands that separated this area from the suburban village of Harlem.[8] Among the series of villas a Schermerhorn country house overlooked the river at the foot of present-day 73rd Street and another, Peter Schermerhorn's at 66th Street,[9] and the Riker homestead was similarly sited at the foot of 75th Street.[10] By the mid-19th century the farmland had largely been subdivided, with the exception of the 150 acres (61?ha) of Jones's Wood, stretching from 66th to 76th Streets and from the Old Post Road (Third Avenue) to the river[11] and the farmland inherited by James Lenox, who divided it into blocks of houselots in the 1870s,[12] built his Lenox Library on a Fifth Avenue lot at the farm's south-west corner,[13] and donated a full square block for the Presbyterian Hospital, between 70th and 71st Streets, and Madison and Park Avenues.[14] At that time, along the Boston Post Road taverns stood at the mile-markers, Five-Mile House at 72nd Street and Six-Mile House at 97th, a New Yorker recalled in 1893.[10]\\r\\nThe fashionable future of the narrow strip between Central Park and the railroad cut was established at the outset by the nature of its entrance, in the southwest corner, north of the Vanderbilt family's favored stretch of Fifth Avenue from 50th to 59th Streets.[15] A row of handsome townhouses was built on speculation by Mary Mason Jones, who owned the entire block bounded by 57th and 58th Streets and Fifth and Madison. In 1870 she occupied the prominent corner house at 57th and Fifth, though not in the isolation described by her niece, Edith Wharton, whose picture has been uncritically accepted as history, as Christopher Gray has pointed out.[16]\\r\\nIt was her habit to sit in a window of her sitting room on the ground floor, as if watching calmly for life and fashion to flow northward to her solitary door... She was sure that presently the quarries, the wooden greenhouses in ragged gardens, the rocks from which goats surveyed the scene, would vanish before the advance of residences as stately as her own.[17]\\r\\nBefore the Park Avenue Tunnel was covered (finished in 1910), fashionable New Yorkers shunned the smoky railroad trench up Fourth Avenue (now Park Avenue), to build stylish mansions and townhouses on the large lots along Fifth Avenue, facing Central Park, and on the adjacent side streets. The latest arrivals were the rich Pittsburghers Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick. The classic phase of Gilded Age Fifth Avenue as a stretch of private mansions was not long-lasting: the first apartment house to replace a private mansion on upper Fifth Avenue was 907 Fifth Avenue (1916), at 72nd Street, the neighborhood's grand carriage entrance to Central Park.[18]\\r\\nMost members of New York's upper class families have made residences on the Upper East Side, including the oil-rich Rockefellers,[19] political Roosevelts,[20] political dynastic Kennedys,[21] thoroughbred racing moneyed Whitneys,[22][23] and tobacco and electric power fortuned Dukes.[24]\\r\\nConstruction of the Third Avenue El, opened from 1878 in sections, followed by the Second Avenue El, opened in 1879, linked the Upper East Side's middle class and skilled artisans closely to the heart of the city, and confirmed the modest nature of the area to their east. The ghostly \\"Hamilton Square\\", which had appeared as one of the few genteel interruptions of the grid plan on city maps since the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, was intended to straddle what had now become the Harlem Railroad right-of-way between 66th and 69th Streets; it never materialized, though during the Panic of 1857 its unleveled ground was the scene of an open-air mass meeting called in July to agitate for the secession of the city and its neighboring counties from New York State, and the city divided its acreage into house lots and sold them.[25] From the 1880s the neighborhood of Yorkville became a suburb of middle class Germans.[26]\\r\\nGracie Mansion, the last remaining suburban villa overlooking the East River at Carl Schurz Park, became the home of New York's mayor in 1942.[27] The East River Drive, designed by Robert Moses, was extended south from the first section, from 125th Street to 92nd Street, which was completed in 1934 as a boulevard, an arterial highway running at street level; reconstruction designs from 1948 to 1966 converted FDR Drive, as it was renamed after Franklin Delano Roosevelt, into the full limited-access parkway that is in use today.[28]\\r\\nDemolishing the elevated railways on Third and Second Avenues opened these tenement-lined streets to the construction of high-rise apartment blocks starting in the 1950s. However, it had an adverse effect on transportation, because the IRT Lexington Avenue Line was now the only subway line in the area.[29] The construction of the Second Avenue Subway has brought up the price of houses in the Upper East Side somewhat.\\r\\nNeighborhood boundaries in New York City are not officially set, but according to the Encyclopedia of New York City, the Upper East Side is bounded by 59th Street in the south, 96th Street on the north, Fifth Avenue to the west and the East River to the east.[30] The AIA Guide to New York City extends the northern boundary to 106th Street near Fifth Avenue.[31]\\r\\nThe area's north-south avenues are Fifth, Madison, Park, Lexington, Third, Second, First, York, and East End Avenues, with the latter running only from East 79th Street to East 90th Street. The major east-west streets are 59th Street, 72nd Street, 79th Street, 86th Street and 96th Street.\\r\\nSome real estate agents use the term \\"Upper East Side\\" instead of \\"East Harlem\\" to describe areas that are slightly north of 96th Street and near Fifth Avenue, in order to avoid associating these areas with the negative connotations of the latter, a neighborhood which is generally perceived as less prestigious.[32]\\r\\nThe Upper East Side Historic District is one of New York Citys largest districts, as is the neighborhood. This district runs from 59th to 78th Streets along Fifth Avenue, and up to 3rd Avenue at some points. In the decades after the Civil War, the once decrepit district transitioned into a thriving middle class residential neighborhood. At the start of the 20th century, the neighborhood transformed again, but this time into a neighborhood of mansions and townhouses. As the century continued, and living environments altered, a lot of these single-family homes were replaced by lavish apartment buildings.[33]\\r\\nAs of the 2000 census, there were 207,543 people residing in the Upper East Side. The population density was 118,184 people per square mile (45,649/km2), making Manhattan Community Board 8, coterminous with the Upper East Side, the densest Community Board in the city.[34] The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 89.25% White, 6.14% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 1.34% African American, 0.09% Native American, 1.39% from other races, and 1.74% from two or more races. 5.62% of the population were Hispanic of any race. Twenty-one percent of the population was foreign born; of this, 45.6% came from Europe, 29.5% from Asia, 16.2% from Latin America and 8.7% from other. The female-male ratio was very high with 125 females for 100 males.[35] The Upper East Side contains a large and affluent Jewish population estimated at 56,000.[36] Traditionally, the Upper East Side has been dominated by wealthy White Anglo-Saxon Protestant families.[37][38][39]\\r\\nGiven its very high population density and per capita income ($85,081 in 2000), the neighborhood contains the greatest concentration of individual wealth in Manhattan.[40] As of 2011, the median household income for the Upper East Side was $117,903.[41] As of 2011, 60.6% of adults (25+) had earned a bachelor's degree or higher.[41]\\r\\nThe Upper East Side maintains the highest pricing per square foot in the United States. A 2002 report cited the average cost per square meter as $8,856; however, that price has noticed a substantial jump, increasing to almost as much as $11,200 per square meter as of 2006. There are some buildings which cost about $125 per square foot (~$1345/).[42][43] The only public housing projects for those of low to moderate incomes on the Upper East Side are located just south of the neighborhood's northern limit at 96th Street, the Holmes Towers and Isaacs Houses. It borders East Harlem, which has the highest concentration of public housing in the United States.[44]\\r\\nThe Upper East Side is one of few areas of Manhattan where Republicans constitute more than 20% of the electorate. In the southwestern part of the neighborhood, Republican voters equal Democratic voters (the only such area in Manhattan), whereas in the rest of the neighborhood Republicans make up between 20 and 40% of registered voters.[45]\\r\\nThe Upper East Side is notable as a significant location of political fundraising in the United States. Four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP Code, 10021, is on the Upper East Side and generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of both George W. Bush and John Kerry.[46]\\r\\nThe area is host to some of the most famous museums in the world. The string of museums along Fifth Avenue fronting Central Park has been dubbed \\"Museum Mile\\", running between 82nd and 105th Streets. It was once named \\"Millionaire's Row\\". The following are among the cultural institutions on the Upper East Side:\\r\\nMany diplomatic missions are located in former mansions on the Upper East Side:\\r\\nOther missions to the United Nations in the Upper East Side include:[53]\\r\\nThe United States Postal Service operates post offices at Lenox Hill Station (ZIP code 10021), 221 East 70th Street; Cherokee Station (10075), 1483 York Avenue;[54] Gracie Station (10028), 229 East 85th Street;[55] and Yorkville Station (10128), 1617 Third Avenue.[3][56] New ZIP codes now include 10065, 10029 and 10075.\\r\\nThe Upper East Side is served by two subway lines, the four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line (4, ?5, ?6, and <6> trains) under Lexington Avenue and the two-track Second Avenue Subway (N, ?Q, and ?R trains) under Second Avenue.[57] There are also local and limited MTA Regional Bus Operations routes M1, M2, M3, M4, M15, M15 SBS, M31, M98, M101, M102, M103 going uptown and downtown, as well as the crosstown M66, M72, M79 SBS, M86 SBS, and M96.[58]\\r\\nThe Second Avenue Line serves to relieve congestion on the Lexington Avenue Line. The first phase of the line opened on January 1, 2017, consisting of three new stations and a renovated fourth station. The line terminates at 96th Street and connects to the BMT 63rd Street Line at Lexington Avenueÿ63rd Street station before continuing to 57th StreetÿSeventh Avenue on the BMT Broadway Line.[59][60] The planned Second Avenue Line includes three additional phases to be built at a later date, which will extend the line north to 125th Street/Park Avenue in Harlem and south to Hanover Square in the Financial District, and a new T train will run its entire length.[61]\\r\\nThe New York City Department of Education operates public schools in the city.\\r\\nPublic lower and middle schools\\r\\nPublic high schools\\r\\nOther schools\\r\\nCoeducational schools\\r\\nGirls' schools\\r\\nBoys' schools\\r\\nThe New York Public Library operates the 67th Street Branch Library at 328 East 67th Street, near First Avenue,[68] the Yorkville Branch Library, 222 East 79th Street[69] and the 96th Street Branch Library at 112 East 96th Street, near Lexington Avenue.[70]\\r\\nThe Upper East Side has been a setting for many films, television shows, and other media.\\r\\nThe neighborhood has a long tradition of being home to some of the world's most wealthy, powerful and influential families and individuals.

The Ministry of Interior is the principal organ of state security and control.\\r\\nAccording to the Cuban Constitution Article 94, the First Vice President of the Council of State assumes presidential duties upon the illness or death of the President. On July 31, 2006, during the 2006 Cuban transfer of duties, Fidel Castro delegated his duties as President of the Council of state, first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party and the post of commander in chief of the armed forces to first Vice President Ra~l Castro.\\r\\nCuba has an elected national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power (Asamblea Nacional del Poder Popular), which has 612 members, elected every 5 years and holds brief sessions to ratify decisions by the executive branch. The National Assembly convenes twice a year in ordinary periods of sessions. However, it has permanent commissions to look after issues of legislative interest. Among its permanent or temporary commissions are those in charge of issues concerning the economy, sugar industry, industries, transportation and communications, constructions, foreign affairs, public health, defense and interior order. The National Assembly also has permanent departments that oversee the work of the Commissions, Local Assemblies of the People's Power, International Relations, Judicial Affairs and the Administration.[2]\\r\\nArticle 88(h) of the Constitution of Cuba, adopted in 1976, provides for citizen proposals of law, prerequisite that the proposal be made by at least 10,000 citizens who are eligible to vote. In 2002 supporters of a movement known as the Varela Project submitted a citizen proposal of law with 11,000 signatures calling for a national referendum on political and economic reforms. The Government response was to collect 8.1 million signatures to request that Cuba's National Assembly enact a constitutional amendment making socialism an unalterable feature of Cuban government.[3]\\r\\nThe Committees for the Defense of the Revolution is a network of neighborhood organizations across Cuba and most Cubans are members. The organizations are designed to put medical, educational or other campaigns into national effect, and to report \\"counter-revolutionary\\" activity.

Such citizens must be aged over sixteen years, must not have been found guilty of a criminal offense, and cannot be mentally handicapped. Cubans living abroad are denied the right to vote. The national elections for the 612 members[4] of the National Assembly of People's Power are held according to this system and the precepts of the 1976 Constitution. From 1959 to 1976, a legislative branch did not exist. In 1992 the Constitution was reformed to allow direct voting to elect members to the National Assembly. Only one candidate stood for each seat in the January 19, 2003 election.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder the system,[5] neighbors meet to propose the candidates to the Municipal Assemblies. The candidates do not present a political platform, but only their resumes. The municipal candidates elected in each neighborhood then elect the Municipal Assembly members. In turn, the Municipal Assembly members elect the Provincial Assembly members, who in turn elect the national Assembly members. A direct vote is then cast to decide whether the decanted members that appear in the final step need to be ratified.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom 1959 to 1992, when the New Electoral Law of the new Constitutional amendments was enacted, the Cuban people were not afforded the right to vote for the members of the legislative powerthe executive power is elected by the National Assembly and there is no popular vote for the President or the Prime Minister. Aside from the Communist Party of Cuba, political parties have legally existed within the country since 1992. Nevertheless, the Constitutional reform of 1992 that granted their right to exist simultaneously denied their right to gather or publicize their existence, a restriction the Communist Party also faces. The most important of these political parties are the Christian Democratic Party of Cuba, the Cuban Socialist Democratic Current, the Democratic Social-Revolutionary Party of Cuba, the Democratic Solidarity Party, the Liberal Party of Cuba and the Social Democratic Co-ordination of Cuba.[citation needed]\\r\\nCuba's foreign policy has been scaled back and redirected as a result of economic hardship after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. Without massive Soviet subsidies and its primary trading partner Cuba was comparatively isolated in the 1990s, but has since entered bilateral co-operation with several South American countries, most notably Venezuela and Bolivia. Cuba has normal diplomatic and economic relations with every country in the Western hemisphere except El Salvador and the United States. El Salvador, under the new government of Mauricio Funes, is expected to institute both in June, 2009.[8] The United States continues an embargo \\"so long as [Cuba] continues to refuse to move toward democratization and greater respect for human rights.\\"[9] The European Union accuses Cuba of \\"continuing flagrant violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms\\", but also \\"Reiterates its condemnation of the US embargo on Cuba, and calls for it to be lifted forthwith, as the UN General Assembly has repeatedly demanded.\\"[10]\\r\\nCuba has developed a growing relationship with the People's Republic of China and Russia. In all, Cuba continues to have formal relations with 160 nations, and provided civilian assistance workers ÿ principally medical ÿ in more than 20 nations.[11] More than two million exiles have escaped to foreign countries. Cuba's present foreign minister is Bruno Rodrguez Parrilla.\\r\\nOfficially, Cuba is a people's democracy, as opposed to the \\"liberal democracy\\" of Western states. Cuba thus rejects criticism of its political system as a lack of apprehension for different forms of democracy other than those in capitalist states.[12] It alludes to the grass roots elements in the nomination of candidates at neighborhood level (in the so-called circunscripciones).[13]\\r\\nOpposition groups inside and outside the country as well as international NGOs[14] and foreign governments have described the Cuban political system as undemocratic. The United States Government has initiated various policy measures; these have been ostensibly designed to urge Cuba to undertake political change towards a multi-party electoral system. These plans have been condemned by the Cuban Government, who accuses the United States of meddling in Cuba's affairs.[15] The Cuban political system is normally described as undemocratic by human rights groups and academics and is usually classified as a dictatorship, one-party state or a totalitarian state. Those who see Cuba as a democracy have described it a grassroots democracy, a centralized democracy or a revolutionary democracy.[16]\\r\\nCuba is the only authoritarian regime in the Americas, according to the 2010 Democracy Index. Cuba's extensive censorship system was close to North Korea on the 2008 Press Freedom Index.[17] The media is operated under the Communist Partys Department of Revolutionary Orientation, which \\"develops and coordinates propaganda strategies\\".[18] According to Maria Werlau, the extreme concentration of power to the Castro family seems comparable in modern times only to that of North Korea under the regimes of Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung.[19]\\r\\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, Castro constructed a \\"repressive machinery\\" that continues to deprive Cubans of their basic rights.[20] The Cuban government has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trials, and extrajudicial executions (a.k.a. \\"El Pared܇n\\").[21] Human Rights Watch reports that the government represses nearly all forms of political dissent.

It has a population of 175,396 according to the 2010 census, making it the fifteenth most populous city in the state.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Grand Prairie was first established as Dechman by Alexander McRae Dechman in 1863. Prior to then, he resided in Young County near Fort Belknap. The 1860 U.S. Federal Census - Slave Schedules shows an A McR Dechman as having 4 slaves, ages 50, 25, 37 and 10. Dechman, learned that he could trade his oxen and wagons for land in Dallas County. In 1863, Dechman bought 239.5 acres (96.9?ha) of land on the eastern side of the Trinity River and 100 acres (40?ha) of timber land on the west side of the river for a broken-down wagon, oxen team and US$200 in Confederate money. He tried to establish a home on the property, but ran into difficulties, so he returned to his family in Birdville before joining in the Civil War. In 1867 he filed a town plat consisting of 50 acres (20?ha) with Dallas County.\\r\\nAfter the war, he returned to Birdville for two years before selling that farm in 1867 and moving to Houston, where yellow fever broke out, causing the family to settle in Bryan. In 1876, Dechman traded half his \\"prairie\\" property to the T&P Railroad to ensure the railroad came through the town. The railroad named the depot \\"Dechman\\", prompting its namesake to relocate his home from Bryan to Dechman. His son Alexander had been living in Dechman and operating a trading post and farm. The first church in the area was the Good Hope Cumberland Sabbath School, established in 1870 by Rev. Andrew Hayter. The church was later renamed West Fork United Presbyterian Church and remains an active church.[7]\\r\\nThe first U.S. post office opened in 1877 under the name \\"Deckman\\" rather than \\"Dechman\\", because the U.S. Postal Service couldn't read the writing on the form completed to open the post office. Later that same year, after the Postal Service had adopted the \\"Deckman\\" name, confusion resulted from the T&P Railroad designation \\"Grand Prairie\\". This name was based on maps drawn from around 1850 through 1858 that labeled the area between Dallas and Fort Worth \\"the grand prairie of Texas\\". In order to alleviate the confusion, the Postal Service named the post office \\"Grand Prairie\\".\\r\\nThe town of Grand Prairie was eventually incorporated as a city in 1909. During World War I and since, Grand Prairie has had a long history with the defense and aviation industry. While the present-day Vought plant on Jefferson Avenue is part of a small strip within the Dallas city limits, it was originally in Grand Prairie. During World War II the North American Aviation Plant B produced the Consolidated B-24 Liberator and the P-51C and K Mustang variants. After the war, Vought Aircraft took over the plant. This later became Ling Temco Vought (LTV) and then eventually returned to the Vought moniker. The plant was the production site for the F-8 Crusader and the A-7 Corsair II aircraft of the 1950ÿ1989 time period. The LTV Missile and Space division produced missiles such as the Scout and MLRS. This division was eventually sold to Lockheed Martin, which continues to operate in Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie was also the North American headquarters for Arospatiale Helicopter.

Vehement debate ensued, and the legal pressure from cities like Arlington, Duncanville and Irving wound up overturning part of the annexation attempt.\\r\\nGrand Prairie is located along the border between Tarrant and Dallas counties, with a small portion extending south into Ellis County. The city is bordered by Dallas to the east, Cedar Hill and Midlothian to the southeast, Mansfield to the southwest, Arlington to the west, Fort Worth to the northwest, and Irving to the north.\\r\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 81.1 square miles (210.0?km2), of which 72.1 square miles (186.8?km2) is land and 9.0 square miles (23.3?km2), or 11.08%, is water.[8]\\r\\nThe West Fork of the Trinity River and a major tributary, Johnson Creek, flow through Grand Prairie.\\r\\nGrand Prairie has a long history of flooding from Johnson Creek.

Other portions of Grand Prairie reside within the Arlington, Cedar Hill, Irving, Mansfield, and Midlothian school districts.[22]\\r\\nIn Texas, school district boundaries do not follow city and county boundaries because all aspects of the school district government apparatus, including school district boundaries, are separated from the city and county government entirely, with the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District in the Houston area.\\r\\nThe high schools in the district are South Grand Prairie High School, Grand Prairie High School, Crosswinds High School and Dubiski Career High School. Middle schools include YMLA at Kennedy, Jackson, Reagan, Truman, Fannin, and Adams. Elementary schools include Austin, Bonham, Bowie, Bush, Crockett, Daniels, Dickinson, Eisenhower, Florence Hill, Garcia, Garner, Johnson, Lee, Marshall, Milam, Monroe, Moseley, Powell, Rayburn, Seguin, Travis, Whitt, Williams, and Zavala. However, YWLA at Bill Arnold offers both high school and middle school education.\\r\\nThe Arlington ISD has the second highest portion of Grand Prairie's K-12 student population. Six Arlington ISD elementary schools are within the city limits of Grand Prairie. Grand Prairie residents in the Arlington ISD are located generally west of the Dallas-Tarrant County boundary and north of the intersection of Camp Wisdom and Lake Ridge in southwest Grand Prairie. One of the Arlington high schools, James Bowie High, has more Grand Prairie residents than Arlington residents that are students at the school.\\r\\nGrand Prairie student/residents in the Arlington ISD attend Bowie, Sam Houston, or Lamar High School in the Arlington ISD and their feeder elementary schools and junior high schools.\\r\\nThe Mansfield ISD contains the third highest portion of the Grand Prairie's K-12 student population.

The theory states that a leader's behavior is contingent to the satisfaction, motivation and performance of his or her subordinates. The revised version also argues that the leader engages in behaviors that complement subordinate's abilities and compensate for deficiencies. According to Robert House and John Antonakis, the task-oriented elements of the pathÿgoal model can be classified as a form of instrumental leadership.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first theory was inspired by the work of Martin G. Evans (1970),[2] in which the leadership behaviors and the follower perceptions of the degree to which following a particular behavior (path) will lead to a particular outcome (goal).[3] The pathÿgoal theory was also influenced by the expectancy theory of motivation developed by Victor Vroom in 1964.[4] Vroom built his work on the work of Georgopoulos et al. (1957): A path-goal approach to productivity. Journal of Applied Psychology. Volume 41, No. 6, pages 345ÿ353.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the first of all theory, the manager's job is viewed as guiding workers to choose the best paths to reach their goals, as well as the organizational goals. The theory argues that leaders will have to engage in different types of leadership behavior depending on the nature and the demands of a particular situation. It is the leader's job to assist followers in attaining goals and to provide the direction and support needed to ensure that their goals are compatible with the organization's goals.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nA leader's behavior is acceptable to subordinates when viewed as a source of satisfaction, and motivational when need satisfaction is contingent on performance, and the leader facilitates, coaches, and rewards effective performance. The original path-goal theory identifies achievement-oriented, directive, participative, and supportive leader behaviors:\\r\\n\\r\\nPathÿgoal theory assumes that leaders are flexible and that they can change their style, as situations require. The theory proposes two contingency variables, such as environment and follower characteristics, that moderate the leader behavior-outcome relationship. Environment is outside the control of the follower-task structure, authority system, and work group. Environmental factors determine the type of leader behavior required if the follower outcomes are to be maximized. Follower characteristics are the locus of control, experience, and perceived ability. Personal characteristics of subordinates determine how the environment and leader are interpreted. Effective leaders clarify the path to help their followers achieve goals and make the journey easier by reducing roadblocks and pitfalls. [1] [6]  Research demonstrates that employee performance and satisfaction are positively influenced when the leader compensates for the shortcomings in either the employee or the work setting.  According to Northouse, the theory is useful because it reminds leaders that their central purpose as a leader is to help subordinates define and reach their goals in an efficient manner.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nHouse (1971) refers to Rizzo (1970), stating that a leader initiating structure increases the path instrumentality for subordinates by decreasing role ambiguity. Also, he says that a leader who is initiating structure and consideration will have different effects depending on whether the task is satisfying or unsatisfying to the subordinate and whether the task-role demands are clear or ambiguous. This means that the more satisfying the task, the less positive the relationship is between consideration and subordinate satisfaction and performance ÿ meaning people tend to act and enjoy it without considering whether they should not. Also, it means that when a coach is clear in setting goals and expectations, the goals are more likely to be achieved than if the goals and expectations are unclear.  This is good for coaches, it means that when they can present a goal that is most satisfying to athletes, it is more likely for the athletes to have affective desire for achieving the goal.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a college coach, practicing good ethics in this regard means creating goals that are within reach for a team, and working together with members of a team when creating these goals. Larson and LaFasto in their 1989 book \\"TeamWork\\" place a clear & elevating goal at the forefront of the necessary components for a successful team. \\"The image of a desired state of affairs that inspires action\\" is how Garfield defines a clear goal, according to the authors (p.?27). They say that when the goal is \\"unfocused and \\"politicized\\", it becomes a reason for ineffective team functioning. \\"A sense of mission\\" is a clear characteristic of peak performers', says Garfield, according to the authors. Larson and LaFasto make no mistake in emphasizing the importance of clarity. \\"Elevating\\" to the authors means \\"personally challenging\\" (p.?31). A player asks the personal question of how worthwhile the goal itself is, and what type of difference it makes. The elevating factor of goal setting brings about a sense of urgency, causes a team to lose track of time (relates to the idea of \\"flow\\" in the field of positive psychology), and causes the rate of communication to increase, for example, players calling one another in the evening, outside the sport context, to talk about today's practice or tomorrow's game.","input":"What is the main principle of path-goal theory?"},{"output":"Richard Ramirez","context":"Stay on Main (formerly Cecil Hotel, Hotel Cecil and informally The Cecil) is a budget hotel in Downtown Los Angeles, located at 640 S. Main Street, opened in 1927[1]. It has 600 guest rooms. The hotel has a checkered history, but is currently being renovated and redeveloped into a mix of hotel rooms and residential units.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cecil was constructed in 1924 by hotelier William Banks Hanner, as a destination for business travelers and tourists. Designed by Loy Lester Smith in the Beaux Arts style, the hotel cost $1 million to complete and boasted an opulent marble lobby with stained-glass windows, potted palms and alabaster statuary. Hanner had invested confidently in the enterprise, in the knowledge that several similar hotels had been established elsewhere downtown, but within five years of its opening, the United States sank into the Great Depression. Though the hotel flourished as a fashionable destination through the 1940s, the decades beyond saw the hotel decline, as the nearby area known as Skid Row became increasingly populated with transients.[2] As many as 10,000 homeless people lived within a four-mile radius. By the 1950s the hotel had gained a reputation as a residence for transients.[3] A portion of the hotel was refurbished in 2007 after new owners took over.\\r\\nIn 2011 the Cecil Hotel was rebranded as \\"Stay on Main,\\" complete with a new website  its old website, thececilhotel.com, expired at the end of 2013.[4]\\r\\nThe hotel was sold in 2014 to New York City hotelier Richard Born for $30 million [5], and another New York-based firm, Simon Baron Development, acquired a 99-year ground lease on the property. Matt Baron, president of Simon Baron, said he was committed to the preservation of architecturally or historically significant components such as the hotel's grand lobby, but that his company planned to completely redevelop the interior and fix the \\"hodgepodge\\" work that had been done in more recent years.[6] Beyond renovating rooms, the developer also plans a rooftop pool, gym and lounge. Construction is projected to be complete by 2019.[2]\\r\\nIn February 2017 the Los Angeles City Council voted to deem the Cecil an historic-cultural monument, because it is representative of an early 20th century American hotel, and because of the historic significance of its architect's body of work.[7]\\r\\nAs the area where the Cecil Hotel is located began to decline, suicides and other violent deaths on the premises became more frequent. The first documented suicide at the Cecil was reported in 1931 when a guest named W.K. Norton died in his room after taking poison capsules. [8] Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, more suicides at the Cecil occurred. By the 1960s, longtime residents had begun to call the Cecil \\"The Suicide.\\"[8]\\r\\nIn addition to suicides, the Cecil's history includes other kinds of violence and salacious happenings. It also became a notorious rendezvous spot for adulterous couples, drug activity and prostitution.[8] In 1947 Elizabeth Short, dubbed by the media as the Black Dahlia, was rumored to have been spotted drinking at the Cecil's bar in the days before her notorious and, to date, unsolved murder.[8]\\r\\nIn 1964 a retired telephone operator named \\"Pigeon Goldie\\" Osgood, who had been a well known and well liked long-term resident at the hotel, was found dead in her room. She had been raped, stabbed and beaten, and her room ransacked. A man named Jacques B. Ehlinger was charged with Osgood's murder, but he was later cleared; her death remains unsolved.\\r\\nPerhaps most infamously, in the 1980s the hotel was rumored to be the residence of serial killer Richard Ramirez, nicknamed the \\"Night Stalker.\\" Ramirez had been a regular presence on the skid row area of Los Angeles, but, according to a hotel clerk who claims to have spoken to him, is rumored to have stayed at the Cecil for a few weeks.[8] Ramirez may have engaged in part of his killing spree while staying there.[9] Another serial killer, Austrian Jack Unterweger, stayed at the Cecil in 1991, possibly as an homage to Ramirez. While there, he strangled and killed at least three prostitutes, for which he was convicted in Austria. He hanged himself shortly after his conviction.[10]\\r\\nIn 2013 the Cecil (by then re-branded as the \\"Stay on Main\\") became the focus of renewed attention when surveillance footage of a young Canadian student, Elisa Lam, behaving erratically in the hotel's elevator went viral. The video depicts Lam repeatedly pressing the elevator's buttons, walking in and out of the elevator, and possibly attempting to hide from someone. It was recorded shortly before her disappearance; her naked body was subsequently discovered in a water supply cistern on the hotel roof, following complaints from residents of odd-tasting water and low pressure. Why and how she got into a cistern, which was atop the roof and could only be accessed by taking a stairway to the roof and then climbing a ladder to the tank's covered top, remain a mystery.[11] The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled her death accidental due to drowning, with bipolar disorder being a \\"significant\\" factor.[12]\\r\\nOn March 27, 1987, the band U2 performed an impromptu live concert on the rooftop of a one-storey building on the corner of 7th and Main in Downtown Los Angeles, next door to the Cecil Hotel.

Long for whom Longs Peak was named, approached the Rockies via the Platte River.[5][6] Settlers began arriving in the mid-1800s,[7] displacing the Native Americans who mostly left the area voluntarily by 1860,[8] while others were removed to reservations by 1878.[4]\\r\\nLulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came in search of gold and silver.[9] The boom ended by 1883 with miners deserting their claims.[10] The railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881 and the Big Thompson Canyon Roada section of U.S. Route 34 from Loveland to Estes Parkwas completed in 1904.[11] The 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[12]\\r\\nProminent individuals in the effort to create a national park included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania.[13] The national park was established on January 26, 1915.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople have been visiting the area near Rocky Mountain National Park for at least 11,000 years, including the Lindenmeier and Dent Sites where projectile points were found that were used to hunt Mammoth[15] and Bison antiquus.[1] Both Clovis and Folsom projectile points have been found in the park,[16] some near Trail Ridge. This indicates that there were early hunters, or Paleo-Indians, of large and now extinct mammals, like mastodons and bison antiquus, that traveled through the park. Their shelters were animal hide tents, brush huts, or rock shelters.[1] They traveled into the Rocky Mountain National Park area using a trail that is now Trail Ridge Road.[2]\\r\\nThe Paleo-Indians began hunting smaller, modern bison and looked for many sources of food in nature when they adopted the lifestyle of the Archaic period about eight thousand years ago. Projectile points have been found at Fall River Pass, on Flattop Mountain, at Forest Canyon Pass, on a slope above Chapin Pass, near Oldman Mountain, and other places in the park. Archeologist Wilfred M. Husted said, \\"Evidence indicates intermittent occupation of the Park rather than continuous occupation. Travel back and forth across the Continental Divide was the primary reason why Indians entered the mountains. Small camps indicate seasonal hunting in the valleys and on the mountains.\\"[1]\\r\\nWithin the park there are archeological remains from about 3,850 to 3,400 B.C. of 42 low-walled stone structures or cairns, up to hundreds of feet in length, built for game drive systems.[17] Remains of such structures were found on Mount Ida, Tombstone Ridge, and on Trail Ridge Road.[18] These slight walls served as devices that permitted hunters to direct or herd game animalslike bison, sheep, deer, or elk toward men waiting with weapons. Up to twenty-five people may have been needed to execute the game drive. Hunters may have killed the animals using darts, atlatl, spear throwers, or spears tipped with stone projectile points.[17] A game drive sites was used in this timeframe in an alpine area south of the park (like Mount Albion complex). Since they were temporary camping sites, it was assumed that people still came to the area to hunt and did not live in the mountainous region during the winter.[15]\\r\\nBows and arrows were used to hunt animals by 400 to 650 A.D.,[15][1] and pottery pieces have been found in the park that are dated to this period of time.[1] The Paleo-Indians also continued to use game drives to hunt for meat until about 1000 AD.[15] As hunter-gatherers, they also foraged for roots and berries for sustenance.[15]\\r\\nBetween 1000 and 1300 AD, Ute people moved into the Rocky Mountain and western slope areas of Colorado, perhaps from the Great Basin of Utah.[3] The Ute, who were hunter-gatherers, traveled along Ute trail. Their belongings were carried by the Utes or were pulled by dogs with travois, until they had horses. The Utes camped in bands or small family groupings and stayed in the park area during the summer months and in Estes Park for the winter. Their diet included bison, elk, bighorn sheep, jackrabbit, antelope, deer, berries and roots.[3] When food was scarce, they ate tree bark.[8] In the early 1800s, the Arapaho pushed the Utes out of Estes Park.[8]\\r\\nIn the early 1800s, the northern Arapaho entered into the Rocky Mountain regions of Colorado. At first, they sought lodgepole pines for their tepees from the Kawuneeche Valley. They then spent more time in the Estes Park and surrounding area. The Arapaho also pressed for access to the North Park, Middle Park, and South Park areas, which had been controlled by the Utes.[4] There was a significant battle between the Arapaho and Ute at Grand Lake in which Ute women and children paddled a raft out to the middle of the lake for safety, but were drowned during a sudden storm.[19]\\r\\nAn old Arapaho camp was located at Marys Lake. They had names for many of the sites within the park, often based upon an event or residing animals, which was published in Arapaho Names and Trails.[20] The Arapaho left before 1860 when the area was settled by people of European descent.[8] By 1878, the northern Arapaho were forced into a reservation at Wind River Indian Reservation.[4]\\r\\nThere were three main trails used by the Ute and Arapaho people to travel between Middle Park and Estes Park. One was called Dog Trail, because the Arapaho had dogs pull travois over the snowy trail, is now called Fall River trail. Child's trail has a spot where children had to get off their horses due to the steep terrain; that trail is now Ute Trail and Trail Ridge Road. Big Trail, which went over Flattop Mountain to the Kawuneeche Valley, was used by fast-traveling warriors.[21] Stone cairns were used by the Arapahos and the Utes to mark the forest trails.[22]\\r\\nThere are hundreds of sites with evidence of Native American visits,[23] including Tepee rings found along the Thompson River[24] and other signs of summer camps.[25] Stone and bone tools used for hunting, butchering, processing hides, and cooking have been found in the park.[26] Additionally, Native Americans carried river boulders to the top of Oldman Mountain, the site of their ceremonial vision quests.[25]\\r\\nThe Apache, Cheyenne, Sioux, and Shoshone periodically hunted or raided the area.[23] Comanche people may have also hunted in the Rocky Mountains for hundreds of years.[1]\\r\\nLittle has been recorded of Europeans who might have seen or visited the Rocky Mountain National Park area before the 19th century.[7] French fur trappers visited in 1700s and gave Native Americans firearms in trades.[7] A couple of French trappers called Longs Peak and Mount Meeker Les Deux Oreilles (\\"two ears\\") in 1799.[27] Don Pedro de Villasur led a group of one hundred men from New Spain up the South Platte River into Nebraska and may have seen the Front Range of Colorado. The Spaniards were attacked by unfriendly Pawnees, who killed 88 of the men, and the Spanish lost interest in traveling so far north again.[7]\\r\\nAmerican fur trappers came to Colorado in the early 19th century, but were seen as trespassers. James Pursley was trapping in the area, and he spotted gold in 1805. Joseph Bijeauwho was later a guide for the Long expeditionlived, hunted and trapped in the Rockies for six years. There were other trappers who worked along the Front Range. A. P. Chouteau and Julius De Munn traded with Native Americans for furs from 1811 to 1817, but were subject to having the furs they had acquired confiscated by Spanish patrols. Besides the threat of running into Spanish military patrols, the men were also subject to hostile Native American tribes.[7]\\r\\nStephen Harriman Long of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was engaged by President James Madison in 1819 to lead an expedition into the western frontier to document the topography, fauna, and flora encountered on the voyage to the headwaters of the Arkansas, Red River, and Platte Rivers.[5] The expeditionary team[a] moved westward from the plains,[28] following the South Fork of the Platte River towards the mountains[6] and on the western horizon saw what Long identified the \\"highest peak\\" on June 30, 1820.[28][29][b] By 1825, the name Longs Peak began appearing on maps.[28]\\r\\nRufus B. Sage traveled to the mountains in September 1843 and is believed to be the first white man to enter Estes Park. For a month, he hunted the abundant wildlife.[30] Sage described the area as a concentration of beautiful lateral valleys, intersected by meandering watercourses, ridged by lofty ledges of precipitous rock, and hemmed in on the west by vast piles of mountains climbing beyond clouds. At the time of his visit, Ute and Arapaho lived in the area.[31] Sage published the earliest known description in Rocky Mountain Life, or Startling Scenes and Perilous Adventures in the Far West During an Expedition of Three Years.[32] He was one of the first people to write about the fur trapper's experiences in the vicinity.[33]\\r\\nAfter the MexicanÿAmerican War (1846ÿ1848) and during the gold rush, more people began to travel westward to the Rockies.[7]\\r\\nMilton Estes said about their October 15, 1859 discovery.[7]\\r\\nIn October 1859, while on a hunting expedition, Joel Estes and his son Milton discovered land where \\"no signs that white men had ever been there before us.\\"[34] In 1860, Joel Estes moved his familywhich had included his wife Patsey, six children, five Black slaves, and a few friendsinto two cabins that he built at the eastern edge of the park where Fish Creek, Lyons, and Loveland Roads converge. Estes brought his herd of cattle,[35] that were raised in the green pastures of the park. He hunted deer and elk and sold their meat and hides in Denver.[36] The Civil War broke out in 1861. During a trip that year to Missouri, where he was from, he freed his slaves.[7] In 1865, Charles F. Estes, son of Milton and Mary Flemming Estes,[37] was the first white child born in the park.[32] The winters were too harsh for Estes and he left the area in 1866.[36]\\r\\nGriff Evans moved into the area lived in the Estes cabin. Between 1868 and 1873, he added a gable and made improvements to the cabin.[37] In 1926, the town of Estes Park erected a plaque in remembrance of the Estes family at the site of their cabin.[38]\\r\\nWilliam Byers, editor of the Rocky Mountain News, visited Estes in 1864, and, climbed Mount Meeker when he was unable to find a route to the summit of Longs Peak.[36] His newspaper articles about his visit led to the naming of Estes Valley.[36] Byers, John Wesley Powell, and five other men made the first recorded ascent up Longs Peak in 1868.[39][c]\\r\\nJoseph Wescott moved to Grand Lake in the late 1860s after visiting Hot Sulphur Springs in Middle Park in the hopes of curing his crippling rheumatism. He built a cabin and hunted and fished for food. In the winter of 1867, though, the deep snows made it difficult for him to get the food he needed. He boiled the leather from a chair and supposedly from a pair of shoes for sustenance. He was saved by a hunting party.[41] Westcott was the first permanent resident of the area.[41]\\r\\nPrior to Wescott, Philip Crenshaw built a cabin in 1858 and trapped animals for fur.[42] In 1868, tourists began arriving at Grand Lake.[41]\\r\\nEstes Park became a tourist town beginning in the 1870s.[43] Byers and other adventurous writers came to the area and their published accounts of the area encouraged others to visit for its hunting, fishing, and scenery.[43] Frederick H. Chapin explored the area and published the book, Mountaineering in Colorado: The Peaks about Estes Park in 1889. A peak in the Mummy Range is named for Chapin and his wife named Ypsilon Mountain.[44]\\r\\nPeople who moved to the area engaged in mining, ranching, and lodging. Some were also involved in the lumber industry.[43] The Griffith Sawmill that operated near Bierstadt Lake and a sawmill was established near Hidden Valley.[45]\\r\\nLulu City, Dutchtown, and Gaskill in the Never Summer Mountains were established in the 1870s when prospectors came to the area in search of gold and silver.[9] Joe Shipler staked two silver claims on Shipler mountain in 1879 and built two cabins along the Colorado River and the Lulu City trail. The town of Lulu at one point had 40 houses and a hotel, but the low-yield ore was unprofitable. The boom had ended by December 1883 when miners deserted their claims.[10] Dutchtown was abandoned by 1884.\\r\\nWindham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl, a famous sportsman, visited the area for the first time in 1872[46][d] to hunt elk.[47] Two years later, he decided to purchase 8,000 acres along streams, which gave him access to a total of 15,000 acres, for a private game reserve[47] or cattle ranch.[46] He implemented a fraudulent scheme in which drifters made claims for 160 acres each under the Homestead Acts and acquired additional land through pre-emption rights. Dunraven then purchased the property from them for a nominal amount of money.[48]\\r\\nDunraven's land grab outraged locals.[47] Realizing that the private game reserve in Estes Park was not going to be a viable effort, Dunraven established a game park and hunting lodge in what is now Dunraven Glade, north of Estes Park.[47] He established a cattle ranch in Estes Park[47] called the \\"English Dairy\\", which had Swiss cattle that he brought into the area.[49] In July 1877, Dunraven opened the Estes Park Hotel, with a good view of the mountains.[46] Dunraven visited the area for the last time in the mid-1880s and abandoned much of his vast Estes Park claims. In 1885, he was made Undersecretary for the Colonies, which created increasing responsibilities to Queen Victoria. He also may have lost interest in Estes Park for a number of personal reasons.[46] Dunraven sold most of his lands and interests in the area in 1908 to F.O. Stanley and B.D. Sanborn.[46]\\r\\nAlbert Bierstadt, who may have been the first European to visit the summit of Mount Evans, [50] Bierstadt was commissioned in 1876 by the Earl of Dunraven to make an exceptionally large canvas painting of Longs Peak and Estes Park for $15,000, equivalent to $344,719 in 2017. He traveled throughout the area with Theodore Whyte, the earl's associate, and created sketches and paintings. The two men also looked for a suitable site, with a great view of Longs Peak, to construct an English hotel for the earl.[51][52] Bierstadt took a particular interest in a lake, now called Bierstadt Lake.[50] Harold Marion Dunning, an early historian, said \\"that Bierstadt's favorite place for mountain sketches and material for some of his famous paintings was on the shore of the lake that now bears his name\\".[51] Bierstadt's painting of the lake is now in the Denver Art Museum's collection.[51]\\r\\nThe Denver, Utah and Pacific Railroad reached Lyons, Colorado in 1881; and the Big Thompson Canyon Road was completed in 1904. Automobile stage lines offered transportation to Estes Park from Loveland in 1907 and from Lyons in 1909.[11]\\r\\nThe movement to establish a national park in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado succeeded in 1915 because of the combined efforts of multiple groups of people over many years.[53] Prominent individuals in the effort included Enos Mills from the Estes Park area, James Grafton Rogers from Denver, and J. Horace McFarland of Pennsylvania.[13] Each of these men performed essential work for the cause.[54]\\r\\nEnos Mills, then a 14-year-old boy, moved to Estes Park in 1884.[55] He explored the mountains of the area and wrote many books and articles describing the region.[56] A resort owner, naturalist, and promoter of the conservation of nature, Mills pitched the idea of an \\"Estes National Park\\" in 1909, quickly earning the support of his fellow local businessmen in the form of the Estes Park Protective and Improvement Association.[54] He wrote essays predominantly for popular national magazines like The Saturday Evening Post, and these were published in book form during the more than five-year park campaign, promoting Colorado's Rocky Mountain region to the reading public: Wild Life on the Rockies (1909); The Spell of the Rockies (1911); In Beaver World (1913); and Rocky Mountain Wonderland (1915).[57][58] Mills also toured the country speaking to audiences of the wonder and beauty of the Estes Park area, and gathered the support of influential friends as he went.[59]\\r\\nThe Colorado Geographical Society[e] arranged for two Arapaho elders to return to the park in 1914 and share their names of places before the U.S. Geological Society printed maps of the park. Some of the places in the park that bear Native American names are Nokhu Crags (rocks where the eagles nest), Kawuneechee (coyote) Valley, and Mount Neota (mountain sheeps heart).[61]\\r\\nThe bill passed Congress and was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on January 26, 1915.[14] A formal dedication ceremony was held on September 4, 1915 in Horseshoe Park. The park has expanded over the years, with the largest parcel? the Never Summer Range? added in 1929.\\r\\nThe 1920s saw a boom in building lodges and roads in the park, culminating with the construction of Trail Ridge Road to Fall River Pass between 1929 and 1932, then to Grand Lake by 1938.[12] The Civilian Conservation Corps handled several building projects during the Great Depression and remnants of their camps can be found in the park today.[citation needed]\\r\\nRocky Mountain National Park was a place for downhill skiing. Hidden Valley (Ski Estes Park) operated between 1955 and 1991 along U.S. 34, five miles (8?km) west of Estes Park. The area had been skied by locals long before it opened as a ski area.[62]\\r\\nNot all leave Longs Peak alive and safe. There is a stone gazebo at the Keyhole formation with a plaque memorializing Agnes Vaille, a well-known climber in the 1920s. In January 1925, Vaille fell 100?ft (30?m) while descending the North Face. Vaille survived the fall with minor injuries, but was unable to walk. Her climbing partner, professional mountaineering guide Walter Kiener, went for help; but when rescuers arrived, Vaille had died of fatigue and hypothermia. One of the rescuers, Herbert Sortland, froze to death after breaking his hip while trying to rescue her.[63]\\r\\nOn June 24, 2010, a wildfire burned over 1,500 acres (6.1?km2) of the park in Larimer County near Estes Park. Estes Park Fire Department believed that lightning may have started the fire.\\r\\nIn September 2013, both the park and the town of Estes Park were heavily damaged by a significant 500-year rain event. The park was closed to visitors September 12ÿ19, 2013, and all roads leading to the park entrance from the east were closed for several days to several weeks. At one point, the only way to leave the town of Estes Park was via Trail Ridge Road, the park's scenic byway leading to the town of Grand Lake on the western side of the Continental Divide. The most lasting impacts inside the park were in the Alluvial Fan area, where flood waters, rocks, and debris washed away parking areas, and much of Fall River Road.[64] After repairs, the road reopened on July 2, 2015.","input":"When was the rocky mountain national park established?"},{"output":"1970s","context":"Closed-circuit television (CCTV), also known as video surveillance,[1][2] is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. It differs from broadcast television in that the signal is not openly transmitted, though it may employ point to point (P2P), point to multipoint (P2MP), or mesh wired or wireless links.  Though almost all video cameras fit this definition, the term is most often applied to those used for surveillance in areas that may need monitoring such as banks, stores, and other areas where security is needed. Though Videotelephony is seldom called \\"CCTV\\" one exception is the use of video in distance education, where it is an important tool.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSurveillance of the public using CCTV is common in many areas around the world. In recent years, the use of body worn video cameras has been introduced as a new form of surveillance, often used in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head.[5]  Video surveillance has generated significant debate about balancing its use with individuals' right to privacy even when in public.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn industrial plants, CCTV equipment may be used to observe parts of a process from a central control room, for example when the environment is not suitable for humans. CCTV systems may operate continuously or only as required to monitor a particular event. A more advanced form of CCTV, utilizing digital video recorders (DVRs), provides recording for possibly many years, with a variety of quality and performance options and extra features (such as motion detection and email alerts). More recently, decentralized IP cameras, some equipped with megapixel sensors, support recording directly to network-attached storage devices, or internal flash for completely stand-alone operation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are about 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016. About 65% of these cameras are installed in Asia. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first CCTV system was installed by Siemens AG at Test Stand VII in Peenemnde, Nazi Germany in 1942, for observing the launch of V-2 rockets.[9] The noted German engineer Walter Bruch was responsible for the technological design and installation of the system.[12][not in citation given]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. the first commercial closed-circuit television system became available in 1949, called Vericon. Very little is known about Vericon except it was advertised as not requiring a government permit.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest video surveillance systems involved constant monitoring because there was no way to record and store information. The development of reel-to-reel media enabled the recording of surveillance footage. These systems required magnetic tapes to be changed manually, which was a time consuming, expensive and unreliable process, with the operator having to manually thread the tape from the tape reel through the recorder onto an empty take-up reel. Due to these shortcomings, video surveillance was not widespread. VCR technology became available in the 1970s, making it easier to record and erase information, and use of video surveillance became more common.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1990s, digital multiplexing was developed, allowing several cameras to record at once, as well as time lapse and motion-only recording. This increased savings of time and money which then led to an increase in the use of CCTV.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently CCTV technology has been enhanced with a shift toward Internet-based products and systems, and other technological developments.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nClosed-circuit television was used for professional boxing, as a form of pay-per-view theatre television. Boxing telecasts were broadcast live to a select number of venues, mostly theaters, where viewers paid for tickets to watch the fight live.[17][18] The first fight with a closed-circuit telecast was Joe Louis vs. Joe Walcott in 1948.[19] Closed-circuit telecasts peaked in popularity with Muhammad Ali in the 1960s and 1970s,[17][18] with \\"The Rumble in the Jungle\\" fight drawing 50?million CCTV viewers worldwide in 1974,[20] and the \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" drawing 100?million CCTV viewers worldwide in 1975.[21] Closed-circuit television was gradually replaced by pay-per-view home cable television in the 1980s and 1990s.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1968, Olean, New York was the first city in the United States to install video cameras along its main business street in an effort to fight crime.[22] Another early appearance was in 1973 in Times Square in New York City.[23] The NYPD installed it in order to deter crime that was occurring in the area; however, crime rates did not appear to drop much due to the cameras.[23] Nevertheless, during the 1980s video surveillance began to spread across the country specifically targeting public areas.[15] It was seen as a cheaper way to deter crime compared to increasing the size of the police departments.[23] Some businesses as well, especially those that were prone to theft, began to use video surveillance.[23] From the mid-1990s on, police departments across the country installed an increasing number of cameras in various public spaces including housing projects, schools and public parks departments.[23] CCTV later became common in banks and stores to discourage theft, by recording evidence of criminal activity. In 1998, 3,000 CCTV systems were in use in New York City.[24] A study by Nieto in 2008 found many businesses in the United States had invested heavily in video surveillance technology to protect products and promote safe workplace and consumer environments. A nationwide survey of a wide variety of companies found that 75 percent utilize CCTV surveillance. In private sector CCTV surveillance technology is operated in a wide variety of establishments such as in industry/manufacturing, retailing, financial/insurance/banking, transportation and distribution, utilities/communications, health care, and hotels/motels, parking areas, jewelry shops.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperiments in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s, including outdoor CCTV in Bournemouth in 1985, led to several larger trial programs later that decade. The first use by local government was in King's Lynn, Norfolk, in 1987.[25] These were deemed successful in the government report \\"CCTV: Looking Out For You\\", issued by the Home Office in 1994, and paved the way for an increase in the number of CCTV systems installed. Today, systems cover most town and city centres, and many stations, car-parks and estates.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2009 systematic review by researchers from Northeastern University and University of Cambridge used meta-analytic techniques to pool the average effect of CCTV on crime across 41 different studies.[26] The results indicated that\\r\\n\\r\\nThe studies included in the meta-analysis used quasi-experimental evaluation designs that involve before-and-after measures of crime in experimental and control areas.[26] However, several researchers have pointed to methodological problems associated with this research literature. First, researchers have argued that the British car park studies included in the meta-analysis cannot accurately control for the fact that CCTV was introduced simultaneously with a range of other security-related measures.[27] Second, some have noted that, in many of the studies, there may be issues with selection bias since the introduction of CCTV was potentially endogenous to previous crime trends.[28] In particular, the estimated effects may be biased if CCTV is introduced in response to crime trends.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been argued that problems of selection bias and endogeneity can be addressed by stronger research designs such as randomized controlled trials and natural experiments. A 2017 review published in Journal of Scandinavian Studies in Criminology and Crime Prevention compiles seven studies that use such research designs. The studies included in the review found that CCTV reduced crime by 24-28% in public streets and urban subway stations. It also found that CCTV could decrease unruly behaviour in football stadiums and theft in supermarkets/mass merchant stores. However, there was no evidence of CCTV having desirable effects in parking facilities or suburban subway stations. Furthermore, the review indicates that CCTV is more effective in preventing property crimes than in violent crimes.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother question in the effectiveness of CCTV for policing is around uptime of the system; in 2013 City of Philadelphia Auditor found that the $15M system was operational only 32% of the time.[31] There is still much research to be done to determine the effectiveness of CCTV cameras on crime prevention before any conclusions can be drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is strong anecdotal evidence that CCTV aids in detection and conviction of offenders; indeed UK police forces routinely seek CCTV recordings after crimes.[32] Moreover, CCTV has played a crucial role in tracing the movements of suspects or victims and is widely regarded by antiterrorist officers as a fundamental tool in tracking terrorist suspects. Large-scale CCTV installations have played a key part of the defences against terrorism since the 1970s. Cameras have also been installed on public transport in the hope of deterring crime,[33][34] and in mobile police surveillance vehicles, often with automatic number plate recognition, and a network of APNI-linked cameras is used to manage London's congestion charging zone. Even so, there is political hostility to surveillance and several commentators downplay the evidence of CCTV's effectiveness, especially in the US.[35] However, most of these assertions are based on poor methodology or imperfect comparisons.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nA more open question is whether most CCTV is cost-effective. While low-quality domestic kits are cheap the professional installation and maintenance of high definition CCTV is expensive.[37] Gill and Spriggs did a Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of CCTV in crime prevention that showed little monetary saving with the installation of CCTV as most of the crimes prevented resulted in little monetary loss.[38] Critics however noted that benefits of non-monetary value cannot be captured in a traditional Cost Effectiveness Analysis and were omitted from their study.[38]  A 2008 Report by UK Police Chiefs concluded that only 3% of crimes were solved by CCTV.[39] In London, a Metropolitan Police report showed that in 2008 only one crime was solved per 1000 cameras.[40] In some cases CCTV cameras have become a target of attacks themselves.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nCities such as Manchester in the UK are using DVR-based technology to improve accessibility for crime prevention.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 2009, an \\"Internet Eyes\\" website was announced which would pay members of the public to view CCTV camera images from their homes and report any crimes they witnessed. The site aimed to add \\"more eyes\\" to cameras which might be insufficiently monitored. Civil liberties campaigners criticized the idea as \\"a distasteful and a worrying development\\".[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2013 Oaxaca hired deaf police officers to lip read conversations to uncover criminal conspiracies.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Singapore, since 2012, thousands of CCTV cameras have helped deter loan sharks, nab litterbugs and stop illegal parking, according to government figures.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recent years, the use of body worn video cameras has been introduced for a number of uses. For example, as a new form of surveillance in law enforcement, with cameras located on a police officer's chest or head.[46][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustrial processes that take place under conditions dangerous for humans are today often supervised by CCTV. These are mainly processes in the chemical industry, the interior of reactors or facilities for manufacture of nuclear fuel. Special cameras for some of these purposes include line-scan cameras and thermographic cameras which allow operators to measure the temperature of the processes. The usage of CCTV in such processes is sometimes required by law.[specify]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany cities and motorway networks have extensive traffic-monitoring systems, using closed-circuit television to detect congestion and notice accidents.[47] Many of these cameras however, are owned by private companies and transmit data to drivers' GPS systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UK Highways Agency has a publicly owned CCTV network of over 3000 Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras covering the British motorway and trunk road network. These cameras are primarily used to monitor traffic conditions and are not used as speed cameras. With the addition of fixed cameras for the active traffic management system, the number of cameras on the Highways Agency's CCTV network is likely to increase significantly over the next few years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe London congestion charge is enforced by cameras positioned at the boundaries of and inside the congestion charge zone, which automatically read the licence plates of cars. If the driver does not pay the charge then a fine will be imposed. Similar systems are being developed as a means of locating cars reported stolen.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther surveillance cameras serve as traffic enforcement cameras.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA CCTV system may be installed where any example, on a Driver-only operated train CCTV cameras may allow the driver to confirm that people are clear of doors before closing them and starting the train.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany sporting events in the United States use CCTV inside the venue for fans to see the action while they are away from their seats. The cameras send the feed to a central control center where a producer selects feeds to send to the television monitors that fans can view. CCTV monitors for viewing the event by attendees are often placed in lounges, hallways, and restrooms. This use of CCTV is not used for surveillance purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganizations use CCTV to monitor the actions of workers. Every action is recorded as an information block with subtitles that explain the performed operation. This helps to track the actions of workers, especially when they are making critical financial transactions, such as correcting or cancelling of a sale, withdrawing money or altering personal information.\\r\\n\\r\\nActions which an employer may wish to monitor could include:\\r\\n\\r\\nEach of these operations is transmitted with a description, allowing detailed monitoring of all actions of the operator. Some systems allow the user to search for a specific event by time of occurrence and text description, and perform statistical evaluation of operator behaviour. This allows the software to predict deviations from the standard workflow and record only anomalous behaviour.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, Britain,[50] Australia[51] and New Zealand, CCTV is widely used in schools due to its success in preventing bullying, vandalism, monitoring visitors and maintaining a record of evidence in the event of a crime. There are some restrictions on installation, with cameras not being installed in an area where there is a \\"reasonable expectation of privacy\\", such as bathrooms, gym locker areas and private offices (unless consent by the office occupant is given). ameras are generally acceptable in hallways, parking lots, front offices where students, employees, and parents come and go, gymnasiums, cafeterias, supply rooms and classrooms. The installation of cameras in classrooms may be objected to by some teachers.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminals may use surveillance cameras to monitor the public. For example, a hidden camera at an ATM can capture people's PINs as they are entered, without their knowledge. The devices are small enough not to be noticed, and are placed where they can monitor the keypad of the machine as people enter their PINs. Images may be transmitted wirelessly to the criminal. Even lawful surveillance cameras sometimes have their data go into the hands of people who have no legal right to receive it.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nCCTV systems are often used for security monitoring purposes in organizations and homes.[54][55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are an estimated 350 million surveillance cameras worldwide as of 2016 compared with about 160 million in 2012. The growth of CCTV has been slowing in recent years.[8][note 1]\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout 65% of CCTV cameras in the world are installed in Asia.[8] In Asia, different human activities attracted the use of surveillance camera systems and services, including but not limited to business and related industries,[citation needed] transportation,[59] sports,[60] and care for the environment.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, China was reported to have a huge surveillance network of over 170 million CCTV cameras with 400 million new cameras expected be installed in the next three years, many of which use facial recognition technology.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were an estimated 30 million surveillance cameras in the United States in 2011.[63] Video surveillance has been common in the United States since the 1990s; for example, one manufacturer reported net earnings of $120 million in 1995.[64] With lower cost and easier installation, sales of home security cameras increased in the early 21st century. Following the September 11 attacks, the use of video surveillance in public places became more common to deter future terrorist attacks.[23] Under the Homeland Security Grant Program, government grants are available for cities to install surveillance camera networks.[65][66][67] In 2009, there were an estimated 15,000 CCTV systems in Chicago, many linked to an integrated camera network.[68][69][70]  New York City's Domain Awareness System has 6,000 video surveillance cameras linked together,[71] there are over 4,000 cameras on the subway system (although nearly half of them do not work),[72] and two-thirds of large apartment and commercial buildings use video surveillance cameras.[73][74] In the Washington D.C.-area, there are more than 30,000 surveillance cameras in schools,[75] and the Metro has nearly 6,000 cameras in use across the system.[76]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the vast majority of CCTV cameras are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses. According to 2011 Freedom of Information Act requests, the total number of local government operated CCTV cameras was around 52,000 over the entirety of the UK.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough specific legalities of running a home CCTV system in the UK are rather vague there are published [78] rules and regulations that although are mostly common sense, do include some laws that most people may not be aware of, including registering with ICO as a data controller if any CCTV camera catch images of any of the public on, or outside of your property.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article published in CCTV Image magazine estimated the number of private and local government operated cameras in the United Kingdom was 1.85 million in 2011. The estimate was based on extrapolating from a comprehensive survey of public and private cameras within the Cheshire Constabulary jurisdiction. This works out as an average of one camera for every 32 people in the UK, although the density of cameras varies greatly from place to place. The Cheshire report also claims that the average person on a typical day would be seen by 70 CCTV cameras.[79]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cheshire figure is regarded as more dependable than a previous study by Michael McCahill and Clive Norris of UrbanEye published in 2002.[79][80] Based on a small sample in Putney High Street, McCahill and Norris extrapolated the number of surveillance cameras in Greater London to be around 500,000 and the total number of cameras in the UK to be around 4,200,000. According to their estimate the UK has one camera for every 14 people. Although it has been acknowledged for several years that the methodology behind this figure is flawed,[81] it has been widely quoted. Furthermore, the figure of 500,000 for Greater London is often confused with the figure for the police and local government operated cameras in the City of London, which was about 650 in 2011.[77]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CCTV User Group estimated that there were around 1.5 million private and local government CCTV cameras in city centres, stations, airports, and major retail areas in the UK.[82] This figure does not include the smaller surveillance systems such as those that may be found in local corner shops and is therefore broadly in line with the Cheshire report.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearch conducted by the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research and based on a survey of all Scottish local authorities, identified that there are over 2,200 public space CCTV cameras in Scotland.[83]\\r\\n\\r\\nDefra made it legal in 2017 to have all Abbatoirs in the UK now covered by CCTV to prevent cruelty to animals during the slaughter process.[84]\\r\\n\\r\\nProject SCRAM is a policing effort by the Halton Regional Police Service to register and help consumers understand the complex issues of privacy and safety that confront households when dealing with installations of home security systems. \\"The SCRAM program enables community members to voluntarily identify and register their residential video surveillance equipment through a simple, secure, confidential, online form.\\".[85]  It has not been extended to commercial businesses. A wide-ranging effort to provide registration and monitoring of home security and systems.  \\"Security camera registration and monitoring is a community-based crime prevention opportunity and investigative tool that enlists the help of residents and can help prevent crime on three levels. Residential video surveillance cameras can deter criminals from entering the area, can prevent crimes from occurring and help solve crimes by providing valuable evidence to the police.\\"[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn South Africa due to the high crime rate CCTV surveillance is widely prevalent but the country has been slow to implement the latest technology e.g. the first IP camera was released in 1996 by Axis Communications but IP cameras didn't arrive in South Africa till 2008.[86] In order to regulate the number of suppliers in 2001 the Private Security Industry Regulation Act was passed requiring all security companies to be registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority (PSIRA).[87]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Latin America, the CCTV market is growing rapidly with the increase of property crime.[88]\\r\\n\\r\\nMaterial collected by surveillance cameras has been used as a tool in post-event forensics to identify tactics, techniques and perpetrators of terrorist attacks. Furthermore, there are various projects ? such as INDECT ? that aim to detect suspicious behaviours of individuals and crowds.[89] It has been argued that terrorists won't be deterred by cameras, that terror attacks aren't really the subject of the current use of video surveillance and that terrorists might even see it as an extra channel for propaganda and publication of their acts.[90][91] In Germany calls for extended video surveillance by the country's main political parties, SPD, CDU and CSU have been dismissed as \\"little more than a placebo for a subjective feeling of security\\".[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nMany civil liberties campaign groups, academics and consultants have published research papers into CCTV systems. Opponents of CCTV point out the loss of privacy of people under surveillance, and the negative impact of surveillance on civil liberties. Furthermore, they argue that CCTV displaces crime, rather than reducing it. Critics often dub CCTV as \\"Big Brother surveillance\\", a reference to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which featured a two-way telescreen in every home through which The Party would monitor the populace.\\r\\n\\r\\nProponents of CCTV cameras argue that cameras are effective at deterring and solving crime, and that appropriate regulation and legal restrictions on surveillance of public spaces can provide sufficient protections so that an individual's right to privacy can reasonably be weighed against the benefits of surveillance.[93][94][95] However, anti-surveillance activists have held that there is a right to privacy in public areas. Furthermore, while it is true that there may be scenarios wherein a person's right to public privacy can be both reasonably and justifiably compromised, some scholars have argued that such situations are so rare as to not sufficiently warrant the frequent compromising of public privacy rights that occurs in regions with widespread CCTV surveillance. For example, in her book Setting the Watch: Privacy and the Ethics of CCTV Surveillance, Beatrice von Silva-Tarouca Larsen argues that CCTV surveillance is ethically permissible only in \\"certain restrictively defined situations\\", such as when a specific location has a \\"comprehensively documented and significant criminal threat\\".[96] Her central reasoning is that widespread CCTV surveillance violates citizens' rights to privacy and anonymity within the public sphere by jeopardizing both their liberty and dignity. She concludes that CCTV surveillance should therefore be reserved for specific circumstances in which there are clear and reasonably demonstrated benefits to its implementation and few ethical compromises.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy although the Supreme Court has said several of the amendments to the Constitution implicitly grant this right.[97] Access to video surveillance recordings may require a judge's writ, which is readily available.[98] However, there is little legislation and regulation specific to video surveillance.[99][100]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll countries in the European Union are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights which protects individual rights including the right to privacy. The EU's Data Protection Directive regulates access to personal data including CCTV recordings.[101] This directive is translated into the national law of each country within the European Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom the Data Protection Act 1998 imposes legal restrictions on the uses of CCTV recordings and mandates the registration of CCTV systems with the Data Protection Agency. In 2004, the successor to the Data Protection Agency, the Information Commissioner's Office clarified that this required registration of all CCTV systems with the Commissioner, and prompt deletion of archived recordings. However, subsequent case law (Durant vs. FSA) limited the scope of the protection provided by this law, and not all CCTV systems are currently regulated.[102] Nonetheless, private sector personnel in the UK who operate or monitor CCTV devices or systems are considered security guards and have been made subject to state licensing.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2007 report by the UK Information Commissioner's Office, highlighted the need for the public to be made more aware of the growing use of surveillance and the potential impact on civil liberties.[103][104] In the same year, a campaign group claimed the majority of CCTV cameras in the UK are operated illegally or are in breach of privacy guidelines.[105] In response, the Information Commissioner's Office rebutted the claim and added that any reported abuses of the Data Protection Act are swiftly investigated.[105] Even if there are some concerns arising from the use of CCTV such as involving privacy,[106] more commercial establishments are still installing CCTV systems in the UK.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, the UK government enacted the Protection of Freedoms Act which includes several provisions related to controlling and restricting the collection, storage, retention, and use of information about individuals. Under this Act, the Home Office published a code of practice in 2013 for the use of surveillance cameras by government and local authorities. The aim of the code is to help ensure their use is \\"characterised as surveillance by consent, and such consent on the part of the community must be informed consent and not assumed by a system operator. Surveillance by consent should be regarded as analogous to policing by consent.\\"[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Canada, the use of video surveillance has grown very rapidly. In Ontario, both the municipal and provincial versions of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act outline very specific guidelines that control how images and information can be gathered by this method and or released.[108]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sweden, the use of CCTV in public spaces is nationally regulated; requiring permits for any operator (incl. Swedish Police Authority) to install CCTV in public spaces. In an opinion poll commissioned by Lund University in August 2017, the general public of Sweden were asked to choose one measure that would ensure their need for privacy when subject to CCTV-operation in public spaces. 43% favored regulation in the form of clear routines for managing, storing and distributing image material generated from surveillance cameras, 39% favored regulation in the form of clear signage informing that camera surveillance in public spaces is present, 2% favored regulation in the form of having permits restricting the use of surveillance cameras during certain times of day/week, 10% favored regulation in the form of having restrictive policies for issuing permits for surveillance cameras in public spaces. 6% were unsure or did not know.[109]\\r\\n\\r\\nComputer-controlled cameras can identify, track, and categorize objects in their field of view.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nVideo content analysis (VCA) is the capability of automatically analyzing video to detect and determine temporal events not based on a single image. As such, it can be seen as the automated equivalent of the biological visual cortex.\\r\\n\\r\\nA system using VCA can recognize changes in the environment and even identify and compare objects in the database using size, speed, and sometimes colour. The camera's actions can be programmed based on what it is \\"seeing\\". For example; an alarm can be issued if an object has moved in a certain area, or if a painting is missing from a wall, or if a smoke or fire is detected, or if running people are detected, or if fallen people are detected and if someone has spray painted the lens, as well as video loss, lens cover, defocus and other so called camera tampering events.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nVCA analytics can also be used to detect unusual patterns in an environment. The system can be set to detect anomalies in a crowd, for instance a person moving in the opposite direction in airports where passengers are supposed to walk only in one direction out of a plane or in a subway where people are not supposed to exit through the entrances.[110]\\r\\n\\r\\nVCA can track people on a map by calculating their position from the images. It is then possible to link many cameras and track a person through an entire building or area. This can allow a person to be followed without having to analyze many hours of film. Currently the cameras have difficulty identifying individuals from video alone, but if connected to a key-card system, identities can be established and displayed as a tag over their heads on the video.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a significant difference in where the VCA technology is placed, either the data is being processed within the cameras (on the edge) or by a centralized server. Both technologies have their pros and cons.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nA facial recognition system is a computer application for automatically identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. One of the ways to do this is by comparing selected facial features from the image and a facial database.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe combination of CCTV and facial recognition has been tried as a form of mass surveillance, but has been ineffective because of the low discriminating power of facial recognition technology and the very high number of false positives generated. This type of system has been proposed to compare faces at airports and seaports with those of suspected terrorists or other undesirable entrants.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nComputerized monitoring of CCTV images is under development, so that a human CCTV operator does not have to endlessly look at all the screens, allowing an operator to observe many more CCTV cameras.[citation needed] These systems do not observe people directly. Insta Types of body-movement behavior, or particular types of clothing or baggage.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo many, the development of CCTV in public areas, linked to computer databases of people's pictures and identity, presents a serious breach of civil liberties. Conservative critics fear the possibility that one would no longer have anonymity in public places.[112] Demonstrations or assemblies in public places could be affected as the state would be able to collate lists of those leading them, taking part, or even just talking with protesters in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nComparatively harmless are people counter systems. They use CCTV equipment as front end eyes of devices which perform shape recognition technology in order to identify objects as human beings and count people passing pre-defined areas.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost CCTV systems may record and store digital video and images to a digital video recorder (DVR) or, in the case of IP cameras, directly to a server, either on-site or offsite.[citation needed][113]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a cost in the retention of the images produced by CCTV systems. The amount and quality of data stored on storage media is subject to compression ratios, images stored per second, image size and is effected by the retention period of the videos or images.[114] DVRs store images in a variety of proprietary file formats. Recordings may be retained for a preset amount of time and then automatically archived, overwritten or deleted, the period being determined by the organisation that generated them.\\r\\n\\r\\nClosed-circuit digital photography (CCDP) is more suited for capturing and saving recorded high-resolution photographs, whereas closed-circuit television (CCTV) is more suitable for live-monitoring purposes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, an important feature of some CCTV systems is the ability to take high resolution images of the camera scene, e.g. on a time lapse or motion-detection basis. Images taken with a digital still camera often have higher resolution than those taken with some video cameras. Increasingly, low-cost high-resolution digital still cameras can also be used for CCTV purposes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nImages may be monitored remotely when the computer is connected to a network.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nA growing branch in CCTV is internet protocol cameras (IP cameras). It is estimated that 2014 was the first year that IP cameras outsold analog cameras.[116] IP cameras use the Internet Protocol (IP) used by most Local Area Networks (LANs) to transmit video across data networks in digital form. IP can optionally be transmitted across the public internet, allowing users to view their cameras through any internet connection available through a computer or a phone, this is considered remote access. For professional or public infrastructure security applications, IP video is restricted to within a private network or VPN,[117] or can be recorded onto a remote server.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe city of Chicago operates a networked video surveillance system which combines CCTV video feeds of government agencies with those of the private sector, installed in city buses, businesses, public schools, subway stations, housing projects etc.[118] Even homeowners are able to contribute footage. It is estimated to incorporate the video feeds of a total of 15,000 cameras.[119]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system is used by Chicago's Office of Emergency Management in case of an emergency call: it detects the caller's location and instantly displays the real-time video feed of the nearest security camera to the operator, not requiring any user intervention. While the system is far too vast to allow complete real-time monitoring, it stores the video data for later usage in order to provide possible evidence in criminal cases.[120]\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City has a similar network called the Domain Awareness System.\\r\\n\\r\\nLondon also has a network of CCTV systems that allows multiple authorities to view and control CCTV cameras in real time. The system allows authorities including the Metropolitan Police Service, Transport for London and a number of London boroughs to share CCTV images between them. It uses a network protocol called Television Network Protocol to allow access to many more cameras than each individual system owner could afford to run and maintain.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Glynn County Police Department uses a wireless mesh-networked system of portable battery-powered tripods for live megapixel video surveillance and central monitoring of tactical police situations. The systems can be used either on a stand-alone basis with secure communications to nearby police laptops, or within a larger mesh system with multiple tripods feeding video back to the command vehicle via wireless, and to police headquarters via 3G.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegrated systems allow different security systems, like CCTV, access control, intruder alarms and intercoms to operate together.  For example, when an intruder alarm is activated, CCTV cameras covering the intrusion area are recorded at a higher frame rate and transmitted to an Alarm Receiving Centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany consumers are turning to wireless security cameras for home surveillance. Wireless cameras do not require a video cable for video/audio transmission, simply a cable for power. Wireless cameras are also easy and inexpensive to install, but lack the reliability of hard-wired cameras.[121] Previous generations of wireless security cameras relied on analog technology; modern wireless cameras use digital technology which delivers crisper audio, sharper video, and a secure and interference-free signal.[122]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wiltshire, UK, 2003, a pilot scheme for what is now known as \\"Talking CCTV\\" was put into action; allowing operators of CCTV cameras to order offenders to stop what they were doing, ranging from ordering subjects to pick up their rubbish and put it in a bin to ordering groups of vandals to disperse. In 2005 Ray Mallon, the mayor and former senior police officer of Middlesbrough implemented \\"Talking CCTV\\" in his area.[123]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther towns have had such cameras installed.  In 2007 several of the devices were installed in Bridlington town centre, East Riding of Yorkshire.[124]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the widespread implementation of surveillance cameras, glasses are being built which can defeat CCTV cameras. In December 2016 a form of anti-CCTV and facial recognition sunglasses called 'reflectacles' were invented by a custom-spectacle-craftsmen based in Chicago named Scott Urban.[125] They reflect infrared and, optionally, visible light which makes the users face a white blur to cameras. The project easily surpassed its funding goal of $28,000 and reflectacles will be commercially available by June 2017.[126]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnless physically protected, CCTV cameras have been found to be vulnerable against a variety of (mostly illegal) tactics:[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe security camera installation cost in Los Angeles, United States ranges from US$300 to US$3,500. On average, however, the cost can be anywhere from US$893 ÿ US$2,267. The price will go up depending on specific requirements or the extent of the security that will be required.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other factors, the specific type of camera being used has the most significant impact on its cost. The average cost of two digital cameras packaged with an LCD monitor is around US$450. Different brands can also have different prices. The type of technology used also has an impact of security camera installation cost. Wireless camera systems are generally more expensive than their wired counterparts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific type of software that is being used also has a role to play on its price. On average, professional level software is offered at US$75, with some of them requiring annual fees for membership. Network attached storage or DVR, used for storing recorded video, will also be part of the cost. On average, that can cost about US$499. This will depend on the storage capacity and other features of the device chosen by the user.","input":"When was the first cctv camera used in the uk?"},{"output":"one-hour","context":"The SAT Subject Test in Biology is the name of a one-hour multiple choice test given on biology by The College Board. A student chooses whether to take the test depending upon college entrance requirements for the schools in which the student is planning to apply. Until 1994, the SAT Subject Tests were known as Achievement Tests; and from 1995 until January 2005, they were known as SAT IIs. Of all SAT subject tests, the Biology E/M test is the only SAT II that allows the test taker a choice between the ecological or molecular tests. A set of 60 questions is taken by all test takers for Biology and a choice of 20 questions is allowed between either the E or M tests. This test is graded on a scale between 200 and 800. The average for Molecular is 630 while Ecological is 591.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis test has 80 multiple-choice questions that are to be answered in one hour. All questions have five answer choices. Students receive one point for each correct answer, lose ? of a point for each incorrect answer, and receive 0 points for questions left blank.[2] The student's score is based entirely on his or her performance in answering the multiple-choice questions.\\r\\nThe questions cover a broad range of topics in general biology. There are more specific questions related respectively on ecological concepts (such as population studies and general Ecology) on the E test and molecular concepts such as DNA structure, translation, and biochemistry on the M test.[3]\\r\\nThe College Board suggests a year-long course in biology at the college preparatory level, as well as a one-year course in algebra, and lab experience as preparation for the test. The test requires understanding of biological data and concepts, science-related terms, and the ability to effectively synthesize and interpret data from charts, maps, and other visual media.[3] However, most questions from this test are derived from, or are similar to, the pre-2012 AP Biology multiple choice questions.[citation needed] By taking an AP class or a class with similar rigor, one's chances at doing well on this test should improve.","input":"How long is the bio sat subject test?"},{"output":"Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances","context":"Command & Conquer (C&C) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game franchise, first developed by Westwood Studios. The first game was one of the earliest of the RTS genre, itself based on Westwood Studios' influential strategy game Dune II and introducing trademarks followed in the rest of the series. This includes full-motion video cutscenes with a notable ensemble cast to progress the story, as opposed to digitally in-game rendered cutscenes. Westwood Studios was taken over by Electronic Arts in 1998 and closed down in 2003. The studio and some of its members were absorbed into EA Los Angeles, which continued development on the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Westwood Studios developed the critically acclaimed Dune II, Computer Gaming World reported in 1993 that the company would not use the Dune license for Westwood's next strategy game \\"mostly because the programmers are tired of sand\\". The magazine stated that it would have \\"new terrain and enemies\\", and that \\"the design team is serious about doing a multi-player version\\".[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer was released worldwide by Westwood in 1995. The plot is set sometime in the near future where the Earth becomes contaminated by a mysterious resource known as Tiberium. A global war ensues between the UN-formed Global Defense Initiative to contain it and the cult quasi-state revolutionary Brotherhood of Nod, led by the enigmatic Kane, which seeks to harness it. Highly successful, it was followed by Command & Conquer: Red Alert in 1996 which is set in an alternate universe where the Soviet Union wages war with the Allies. Developed as the prequel to the original, the Red Alert series was spun off into a separate, lighthearted and comic series, while the original game and its sequels became known as the \\"Tiberium\\" series, retaining its science fiction and serious tone. The first game is sometimes referred to as Tiberian Dawn as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original game was followed by Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun in 1999 and its expansion pack Tiberian Sun: Firestorm. In 2002, a first person-shooter set in the Tiberium universe, Command & Conquer: Renegade, was released and praised for its online features. Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars was released in 2007 and followed by the expansion pack Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath. Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, released in 2010 as the conclusion to the Tiberium saga, received noticeably more mixed reviews because of its deviation from traditional gameplay and story. The Red Alert series was continued by the 2000 title Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, its expansion, Yuri's Revenge and Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 in 2008, which introduced a third \\"Empire of the Rising Sun\\" faction. A spin-off game in 2003, Command & Conquer: Generals, set in a more realistic near-future and featuring the United States, China and the Global Liberation Army was followed by an expansion pack, Zero Hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was originally marketed to an Anglophone audience, though many of the games have been translated into other languages including German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Korean, and Chinese. The series is primarily developed for personal computers running Microsoft Windows, although some titles have been ported to various video game consoles and the Apple Macintosh. Other games for platforms such as iOS and web-based have also been developed. As of July 2010, the Command & Conquer franchise consists of eleven games and eight expansion packs. The first three games of the series have been released as freeware to promote the successors.[4] A free-to-play game, entitled Command & Conquer, was in development with the studio Victory Games.  It was set to be the next game in the series and was expected to be released in 2013. However, after a short alpha period the game was cancelled, and Victory Games disbanded by EA.[5][6] The Command & Conquer series has been a commercial success with over 30 million Command & Conquer games sold as of 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Command & Conquer are real-time strategy games, with the exception of the first-person shooter Command & Conquer: Renegade. A staple of the series is the parallel campaigns of various different factions to one central storyline. Games in the series also offered multiplayer game options, via LAN and modem connection. All games in the series have also offered online play, as well as \\"skirmish\\" matches in which players can face AI enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Command & Conquer real-time strategy games except Command & Conquer: Generals and its expansions have featured the \\"side bar\\" for navigation and control as opposed to many other similar games where the control bar is located on the bottom of the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer gameplay typically requires the player to construct a base and acquire resources, in order to fund the ongoing production of various types of forces with which to assault and conquer the opponent's base. All available structures of the faction chosen by the player are constructed on-site at so-called \\"construction yard\\" - which typically begin as large-sized vehicles capable of deploying themselves into the aforementioned construction yards, called MCVs or Mobile Construction Vehicle. When a construction yard has finished building a new structure, the player can select a spot near to a preexisting structure in order to place it, where the prefabricated building will then rapidly unfold in a distinctive manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn all games in the series except Command & Conquer: Generals and its expansion, Zero Hour, funds are acquired by specialized \\"harvester\\" units which bring their cargo (Tiberium for the Tiberian series of games or ore or the more valuable gems for the Red Alert series) to a \\"refinery\\" structure. This in turn will convert the raw material into usable resources, expressed as credits. The raw materials themselves, in games released before Red Alert 2 as well as Command & Conquer 3 require storage space in the form of refineries and, in the case of excess, \\"storage silo\\" structures.  In Generals and Zero Hour, funds are collected by two methods: collection of supplies by specialized units and converted to money in \\"supply centers\\" or directly produced by specialized units, buildings, or tech buildings at a set interval of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll factions have structures and units with similar functions at their disposal. However, they are adjusted to fit each faction's theme and have somewhat varying properties. Units can be classified into infantry, vehicles, and aircraft, each with their own subdivisions (note: in the Red Alert series there is also naval craft available). Unit effectiveness against opponents follows the rock-paper-scissors (intransitivity) principle found in most real-time strategy games.\\r\\n\\r\\nVirtually every type of structure in the series acts as a tech tree node, and additional units, structures and faction-specific abilities will become available as new structures are built and placed. Access to advanced units and abilities may be temporarily blocked if the required structures are destroyed or if they are not being provided with adequate power by the supporting \\"power plant\\" structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Command & Conquer game has included the ability to play multiplayer games against other players. Each box of Command & Conquer contains two CD copies of the game, immediately making multiplayer gaming possible with a single purchase of the game. Westwood Studios advertised this on the packaging with the slogan \\"A second copy, so you and your friend can destroy each other.\\" This resulted in Command & Conquer becoming the first RTS game title to feature competitive online play,[7] and this is considered the most pertinent outside factor in the success of Command & Conquer.[8] All games in the series up to Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 also featured two CDs that could be used for this reason. However, later games did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert 3 was noted for being the first RTS game to enable the campaigns to be played cooperatively online; others had only supported single player campaigns. However, it was only possible to connect to other computers through EA's servers and not with LAN play.\\r\\n\\r\\nGames produced by Westwood use the proprietary Westwood Online system to facilitate multiplayer games over the Internet; Renegade also supported GameSpy. Games under EA's development continued to use GameSpy, but dropped support for Westwood Online in favor of using EA's own servers. The GameSpy master servers have shut down in 2013.[9] The community filled the gap with their services.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the shutdown of EA's servers and removed support for the games, the fan base for the series has created their own way to play online. The well maintained CNC online website allows for players to still face off many years after the official server shutdowns. CNC online only supports Command And conquer games made by EA Los Angeles (2003 and later)\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer, released on September 26, 1995,[11] is the first game in the series and is considered as the title which originally defined and popularized the real-time strategy genre.[7][8][12][13][14][15] Command & Conquer introduced the warring factions of the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of Nod. Command & Conquer was well received and was widely praised by critics: \\"Command & Conquer is one of the finest, most brilliantly-designed computer games I have ever seen\\" said GameSpot reviewer Chris Hudak.[16] Command & Conquer has attained 94% as an aggregate score from Metacritic[17] with the less well received Covert Operations expansion pack obtaining an aggregate score of 72% after its 1996 release.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberian Sun, released on August 27, 1999, takes place approximately 30 years after the events in its predecessor. While the original Command & Conquer's plot was centered around an allegorical world politics setting, Tiberian Sun shifted this to a more science fiction-like setting against the apocalyptic background of Tiberium beginning to assimilate vast portions of the Earth's ecosystems. In 1998, Westwood Studios, the developers of Tiberian Sun, was acquired by Electronic Arts. However, EA had no direct part in the development of the title. Compared to its predecessor, Tiberian Sun relies heavily on science fiction technologies and introduces a new isometric game engine featuring varying level terrain to give the impression of a true 3D environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full motion video is also scripted differently; while the cutscenes of Command & Conquer and Red Alert were filmed from a first-person perspective, Tiberian Sun used traditional cinematic shots for its FMVs featuring actors such as James Earl Jones and Michael Biehn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Renegade, released February 26, 2002, takes place in the final days of the events of Command & Conquer and was the last Command & Conquer game to be created by Westwood Studios before their liquidation in 2003. Unlike any other games in the series, Renegade is a first-person shooter.[19] Although receiving average reviews, with an aggregate score of 75% on both GameRankings and Metacritic, Renegade was praised for its online features. GameSpy awarded Renegade its 2002 \\"Wish it had been better\\" award, condemning the single player but saying that \\"C&C: Renegade's multiplayer was innovative and fun\\".[20] Online play was praised for encouraging teamwork and coordinated assaults, unlike other contemporary first-person shooters.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, released March 29, 2007, was a return to the real-time strategy roots of the Command & Conquer series. As a direct sequel to Tiberian Sun, Tiberium Wars is set approximately 17 years after the events of Tiberian Sun and features the introduction of a third faction, the Scrin. The sequel attained an aggregate score of 85% from both GameRankings and Metacritic. PC Gamer U.S. gave the game its \\"Editor's Choice\\" rating at 90%, stating that \\"one of the greatest RTS franchises of all time returns to glory\\", while PC Gamer UK gave it a more reserved rating of 82%, stating that it was \\"a welcome, but limited, return\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the release of Tiberium Wars, the expansion pack Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath was announced. Released on March 24, 2008, Kane's Wrath limited the player to only the Brotherhood of Nod in the campaign mode, though the original factions and six new sub-factions are available for the new strategic mode and skirmish mode. Reception was mainly positive with the expansion attaining an aggregate score of 77%.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, released on March 16, 2010, saw a big change in gameplay from the previous Command & Conquer by removing the resource gathering and base building elements in previous games as well as the removal of the third faction, the Scrin. It is a direct sequel to Kane's Wrath (however not directly following on from its storyline), and is set 10 years after the game's final events, a time when Tiberium has advanced to its next evolutionary stage, and is rapidly spreading across Earth making it soon to be uninhabitable.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenegade X, is a free, fan-made remake of Command & Conquer: Renegade. The developers received approval from EA to release their game,[22] and it entered open beta on February 26, 2014. Renegade X includes a short single-player campaign called Black Dawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert, released on November 22, 1996,[23] is set in an alternate universe 1950s and was originally made to be the prequel to Command & Conquer[24] establishing Red Alert as the prologue of the entire Tiberium series of games. Louis Castle has said that connecting Red Alert with the Tiberium series was a \\"failed experiment\\".[citation needed] Red Alert introduces the Allies and the Soviets as rival factions roughly analogous to NATO and the Warsaw Pact of the Cold War. The game was received well by critics and has the highest average score of any Command & Conquer game with an average of over 90% from GameRankings and Metacritic, unlike the title's two expansion packs, Red Alert: Counterstrike and Red Alert: The Aftermath of which both received below average reviews for the series with 63% and 70% average scores respectively. Both expansions gave the game more missions and more units. For PlayStation only, there was also a separate release to the original called Red Alert: Retaliation which included all the maps, missions and units of Red Alert: Counterstrike and Red Alert: The Aftermath as well as some newly filmed cut-scenes only available with Red Alert: Retaliation. Before being re-released as freeware on 31 August 2008 by Electronic Arts Command & Conquer: Red Alert had sold over three million copies.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert 2 was released on October 23, 2000. It featured a Soviet invasion of North America with tanks, conscripts, large airships, and psychically dominated anti-ship giant squid. Since that game lacked reference to the Tiberian series, the connection established in the first Red Alert game became unclear. However, it has been implied by the original creators of the series, now working at Petroglyph Games, that Red Alert 2 takes place in a parallel universe that came about as a result of time travel experiments taking place some time into the Tiberian series.[26] Red Alert 2 was received fairly positively with an aggregate score of 86% from GameRankings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expansion pack to Red Alert 2, Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge was released on October 10, 2001. In Yuri's Revenge, an ex-Soviet figure named Yuri, tries to conquer the world using psychic technology and his own private army. The expansion pack received mostly positive reviews. GameRankings reports an average score of 85% based on 31 reviews,[27] making Yuri's Revenge the best received expansion pack in the Command & Conquer series.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert 3, released on October 28, 2008, followed up on the story of Red Alert 2 and continued the series' more \\"light-hearted\\" take on Command & Conquer. It introduced many new comical units and the Empire of the Rising Sun faction, an anime inspired version of the Empire of Japan. Executive producer Chris Corry stated in a pre-release interview that Red Alert 3 will further differentiate the playable factions from each other and \\"[play] up the silliness in their faction design whenever possible\\".[28] This approach was seen as popular with Red Alert 3 obtaining an aggregate score of 82% from Metacritic. A stand-alone expansion to Red Alert 3, Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 ÿ Uprising was released on March 12, 2009 to fairly poor reviews for the series with an average score of 64% from Metacritic. Another downloadable standalone game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 was released known as Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 - Commander's Challenge which contained the Commander's Challenge mode of Uprising for consoles.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert was released on October 16, 2009 for iOS which was a continuation of the story of Red Alert 2 and takes place before Red Alert 3. It contained two factions, the Allies and Soviet Union with a third faction, the Empire of the Rising Sun, to be added in its expansion pack. However this is version of the game is not available in some regions (e.g. Uk).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 23, 2018, the Chinese developer Tencent announced a new iOS version of Red Alert would be made available, with a highly mixed reception from fans online.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nDeveloped by Shanghai First Internet Science and Technology Co. Ltd, Decisive Battle: General Kim (?Q?k??), has been released on IOS and Android, in January 2018 in Taiwan, Macau and Hong Kong.\\r\\nAlthough the game is called \\"Decisive Battle: General Kim\\", it was intended to be based on the original PC era real-time strategy classic Command and Conquer Red Alert game. \\r\\nThe game story is set in the current global international nuclear crisis, requiring all the players, up to 16, to form an alliance, take control of a modern army and wage a common war against General Kim.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer: Generals, released on February 10, 2003, has a plotline which is unrelated to the other games of the Command & Conquer series. Generals is set in the near future and features the United States, China and the fictional terrorist organization, the Global Liberation Army. Generals uses an engine dubbed SAGE (or Strategy Action Game Engine) and is the first fully three-dimensional Command & Conquer real-time strategy game. After its release, Generals received mostly positive reviews. Based on 34 reviews, Metacritic gives it a score of 84/100[32] which includes a score of 9.3/10 from IGN.[33] Generals has also received the E3 2002 Game Critics Awards Best Strategy Game award.[34] One review noted that Generals was the first Command & Conquer real-time strategy game that did not include full-motion video cutscenes to tell the story and that it departed from the unique interface and base-building mechanics that had characterized all of the previous C&C RTS titles.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expansion for Generals, Command & Conquer: Generals ÿ Zero Hour, was released on September 22, 2003 to further the Generals storyline.  Zero Hour added 9 new armies to the game, over a dozen new campaign missions, and a gameplay mode known as Generals Challenge.[36] Unlike Generals, Zero Hour featured the return of full motion videos to the series. Zero Hour obtained much the same reception as Generals with an aggregate score of 85% and 84% from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter EA Los Angeles started up their new internal group Danger Close and switched its focus to the Medal of Honor series, EA launched a new studio named Victory Games to continue the Command & Conquer franchise.[37] On December 10, 2011, Electronic Arts posted that the next game in the series would be Command & Conquer: Generals 2.[38] On December 14, it was also announced that a new browser-based, free-to-play MMO Command & Conquer game is under development, under the name Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances.[39] On December 15, Tiberium Alliances began a closed beta.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 15, 2012, it was announced that Generals 2 would be repurposed to a free-to-play game known as simply Command & Conquer.[41] The new game would have been based around the Generals franchise. However, following feedback from players who were able to play the alpha trial, the game was cancelled in October 2013.[42] In 2013, EA has said that the franchise will continue, but has given no other information.[43] In 2014, EA was looking for a new developer for the reboot.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 9, 2018, EA revealed Command & Conquer: Rivals, which is under development by the newly-formed EA Redwood Studios for Android and iOS mobile devices.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also canceled Command & Conquer games.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of the music for the series was composed and produced by Westwood Studios' former sound director and video game music composer Frank Klepacki for the early games, with composition duties being taken on by several others following the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Klepacki returned to the series in 2008 however to assist with the soundtrack for Red Alert 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music has been received positively by critics, although praise was higher with earlier entries.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original score for Command & Conquer: Red Alert was composed by Frank Klepacki and was voted the best video game soundtrack of 1996 by PC Gamer and Gameslice magazines.[46] Among his most famous songs from the series is the theme of Red Alert, titled \\"Hell March\\", which accents the style of the game with adrenalized riffs of electric guitar, the sounds of marching feet, and synthesizers to a dramatic chant. Originally intended to be the theme for the Brotherhood of Nod faction in the Covert Operations expansion to the original 1995 Command & Conquer game,[47] the track eventually ended up enlisting itself as a staple in the Red Alert series instead, and a second version of \\"Hell March\\" was specifically created for Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter C&C came out we wasted no time kicking out Covert Ops. I wrote some more ambient style themes they asked me for, and then I began tinkering with this heavy metal song that I was trying to gear towards Nod for the next big C&C game. Brett Sperry came in my office and said \\"You got anything I can hear for the new C&C?\\" I played it for him. He said \\"What's the name of this one?\\" I said \\"Hell March.\\" He said \\"That's the signature song for our next game.\\"[48]\\r\\nThe Command & Conquer series have been a commercial success with over 30 million Command & Conquer games sold as of 2009.[49] Games in the series have nearly consistently scored highly on video game review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic, which collect data from numerous review websites. As noted in the table below, the highest rated game is Command & Conquer with a score of 94% from Metacritic. The highest rated game averaged over both sites is Command & Conquer: Red Alert with an average of just over 90%. As a series, Command & Conquer games have averaged approximately 80% when including expansion packs and approximately 84% without.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand & Conquer's long history resulted in Guinness World Records awarding the series six world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include \\"Biggest Selling RTS Series\\", \\"Most Number of Platforms for an RTS\\", and \\"Longest Running Actor in Video Game Role\\" for Joe Kucan, who has played the part of Kane, the villainous mastermind of the series, for 15 years.","input":"What is the latest command and conquer game?"},{"output":"calcitriol","context":"Vitamin D is a group of fat-soluble secosteroids responsible for increasing intestinal absorption of calcium, magnesium, and phosphate, and multiple other biological effects.[1] In humans, the most important compounds in this group are vitamin D3 (also known as cholecalciferol) and vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol).[2] Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol can be ingested from the diet and from supplements.[2][3][4] Only a few foods contain vitamin D. The major natural source of the vitamin is synthesis of cholecalciferol in the skin from cholesterol through a chemical reaction that is dependent on sun exposure (specifically UVB radiation). Dietary recommendations typically assume that all of a person's vitamin D is taken by mouth, as sun exposure in the population is variable and recommendations about the amount of sun exposure that is safe are uncertain in view of the skin cancer risk.[5]\\r\\nVitamin D from the diet or skin synthesis is biologically inactive; enzymatic conversion (hydroxylation) in the liver and kidney is required for activation. As vitamin D can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sufficient sunlight, it is not an essential dietary factor, and so not technically a vitamin.[4] Instead it could be considered as a hormone, with activation of the vitamin D pro-hormone resulting in the active form, calcitriol, which then produces effects via a nuclear receptor in multiple different locations.[4] Cholecalciferol is converted in the liver to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); ergocalciferol is converted to 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. These two vitamin D metabolites (called 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) are measured in serum to determine a person's vitamin D status.[6][7] Calcifediol is further hydroxylated by the kidneys to form calcitriol (also known as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the biologically active form of vitamin D.[8] Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, having a major role regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate, and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. Calcitriol also has other effects, including some on cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation.[5]\\r\\nVitamin D has a significant role in calcium homeostasis and metabolism. Its discovery was due to effort to find the dietary substance lacking in children with rickets (the childhood form of osteomalacia).[9] Vitamin D supplements are given to treat or to prevent osteomalacia and rickets, but the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistent.[10][11] The effect of vitamin D supplementation on mortality is not clear, with one meta-analysis finding a small decrease in mortality in elderly people,[12] and another concluding no clear justification exists for recommending supplementation for preventing many diseases, and that further research of similar design is unneeded in these areas.[13]\\r\\nSeveral forms (vitamers) of vitamin D exist. The two major forms are vitamin D2 or ergocalciferol, and vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol; vitamin D without a subscript refers to either D2 or D3 or both. These are known collectively as calciferol.[14] Vitamin D2 was chemically characterized in 1931. In 1935, the chemical structure of vitamin D3 was established and proven to result from the ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol.[15]\\r\\nChemically, the various forms of vitamin D are secosteroids, i.e., steroids in which one of the bonds in the steroid rings is broken.[15] The structural difference between vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 is the side chain of D2 contains a double bond between carbons 22 and 23, and a methyl group on carbon 24.\\r\\nThe active vitamin D metabolite calcitriol mediates its biological effects by binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is principally located in the nuclei of target cells.[15] The binding of calcitriol to the VDR allows the VDR to act as a transcription factor that modulates the gene expression of transport proteins (such as TRPV6 and calbindin), which are involved in calcium absorption in the intestine.[17] The vitamin D receptor belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily of steroid/thyroid hormone receptors, and VDRs are expressed by cells in most organs, including the brain, heart, skin, gonads, prostate, and breast.\\r\\nVDR activation in the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid gland cells leads to the maintenance of calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood (with the assistance of parathyroid hormone and calcitonin) and to the maintenance of bone content.[1]\\r\\nOne of the most important roles of vitamin D is to maintain skeletal calcium balance by promoting calcium absorption in the intestines, promoting bone resorption by increasing osteoclast number, maintaining calcium and phosphate levels for bone formation, and allowing proper functioning of parathyroid hormone to maintain serum calcium levels. Vitamin D deficiency can result in lower bone mineral density and an increased risk of reduced bone density (osteoporosis) or bone fracture because a lack of vitamin D alters mineral metabolism in the body.[18] Thus, vitamin D is also critical for bone remodeling through its role as a potent stimulator of bone resorption.[18]\\r\\nThe VDR may be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Vitamin D also affects the immune system, and VDRs are expressed in several white blood cells, including monocytes and activated T and B cells.[19] In vitro, vitamin D increases expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene in adrenal medullary cells, and affects the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, nitric oxide synthase, and glutathione.[20]\\r\\nA diet deficient in vitamin D in conjunction with inadequate sun exposure causes osteomalacia (or rickets when it occurs in children), which is a softening of the bones. In the developed world, this is a rare disease.[21][22] However, vitamin D deficiency has become a worldwide problem in the elderly and remains common in children and adults.[23][24] Low blood calcifediol (25-hydroxy-vitamin D) can result from avoiding the sun.[25] Deficiency results in impaired bone mineralization and bone damage which leads to bone-softening diseases,[26][27] including rickets and osteomalacia.\\r\\nBeing deficient in vitamin D can cause intestinal absorption of dietary calcium to fall to 15%.[1] When not deficient, an individual usually absorbs between 60-80%.[1]\\r\\nRickets, a childhood disease, is characterized by impeded growth and soft, weak, deformed long bones that bend and bow under their weight as children start to walk. This condition is characterized by bow legs,[27] which can be caused by calcium or phosphorus deficiency, as well as a lack of vitamin D; today, it is largely found in low-income countries in Africa, Asia, or the Middle East[28] and in those with genetic disorders such as pseudovitamin D deficiency rickets.[29]\\r\\nMaternal vitamin D deficiency may cause overt bone disease from before birth and impairment of bone quality after birth.[30][31] Nutritional rickets exists in countries with intense year-round sunlight such as Nigeria and can occur without vitamin D deficiency.[32][33]\\r\\nAlthough rickets and osteomalacia are now rare in Britain, outbreaks have happened in some immigrant communities in which osteomalacia sufferers included women with seemingly adequate daylight outdoor exposure wearing Western clothing.[34] Having darker skin and reduced exposure to sunshine did not produce rickets unless the diet deviated from a Western omnivore pattern characterized by high intakes of meat, fish, and eggs, and low intakes of high-extraction cereals.[35][36][37] The dietary risk factors for rickets include abstaining from animal foods.[34][38]\\r\\nVitamin D deficiency remains the main cause of rickets among young infants in most countries, because breast milk is low in vitamin D and social customs and climatic conditions can prevent adequate sun exposure. In sunny countries such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, where rickets occurs among older toddlers and children, it has been attributed to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited access to dairy products.[37]\\r\\nRickets was formerly a major public health problem among the US population; in Denver, where ultraviolet rays are about 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude,[39] almost two-thirds of 500 children had mild rickets in the late 1920s.[40] An increase in the proportion of animal protein[38][41] in the 20th century American diet coupled with increased consumption of milk[42][43] fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic decline in the number of rickets cases.[1] Also, in the United States and Canada, vitamin D-fortified milk, infant vitamin supplements, and vitamin supplements have helped to eradicate the majority of cases of rickets for children with fat malabsorption conditions.[27]\\r\\nOsteomalacia is a disease in adults that results from vitamin D deficiency. Characteristics of this disease are softening of the bones, leading to bending of the spine, bowing of the legs, proximal muscle weakness, bone fragility, and increased risk for fractures.[44] Osteomalacia reduces calcium absorption and increases calcium loss from bone, which increases the risk for bone fractures. Osteomalacia is usually present when 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are less than about 10?ng/mL.[2] Although the effects of osteomalacia are thought to contribute to chronic musculoskeletal pain,[45] there is no persuasive evidence of lower vitamin D levels in chronic pain sufferers[46] or that supplementation alleviates chronic nonspecific musculoskeletal pain.[47]\\r\\nDark-skinned people living in temperate climates have been shown to have low vitamin D levels but the significance of this is not certain.[48][49][50] Dark-skinned people may be less efficient at making vitamin D because melanin in the skin hinders vitamin D synthesis.[51]\\r\\nThe effects of vitamin D supplementation on health are uncertain.[11][52] A 2013 review did not find any effect from supplementation on the rates of disease, other than a tentative decrease in mortality in the elderly.[53] Vitamin D supplements do not alter the outcomes for myocardial infarction, stroke or cerebrovascular disease, cancer, bone fractures or knee osteoarthritis.[54][55] Low vitamin D levels may result from disease rather than cause disease.[53]\\r\\nA United States Institute of Medicine report states: \\"Outcomes related to cancer, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, and diabetes and metabolic syndrome, falls and physical performance, immune functioning and autoimmune disorders, infections, neuropsychological functioning, and preeclampsia could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting.\\"[56]:5 Some researchers claim the IOM was too definitive in its recommendations and made a mathematical mistake when calculating the blood level of vitamin D associated with bone health.[57] Members of the IOM panel maintain that they used a \\"standard procedure for dietary recommendations\\" and that the report is solidly based on the data. Research on vitamin D supplements, including large-scale clinical trials, is continuing.[57]\\r\\nVitamin D3 supplementation has been tentatively found to lead to a reduced risk of death in the elderly,[12][53] but the effect has not been deemed pronounced or certain enough to make taking supplements recommendable.[13] Other forms (Vitamin D2, alfacalcidol, and calcitriol) do not appear to have any beneficial effects with regard to the risk of death.[12] High blood levels appear to be associated with a lower risk of death, but it is unclear if supplementation can result in this benefit.[58] Both an excess and a deficiency in vitamin D appear to cause abnormal functioning and premature aging.[59][60][61] The relationship between serum calcifediol level and all-cause mortality is parabolic.[56] Harm from vitamin D appears to occur at a lower vitamin D level in the black population than in the white population.[56]:435\\r\\nIn general, no good evidence supports the commonly held belief that vitamin D supplements can help prevent osteoporosis.[13] Its general use for prevention of this disease in those without vitamin D deficiency is thus likely not needed.[62] For older people with osteoporosis, taking vitamin D with calcium may help prevent hip fractures, but it also slightly increases the risk of stomach and kidney problems.[63] Supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D, in those older than 65 years, may decrease fracture risk.[64] The effect is small or none for people living independently.[65][66] Low serum vitamin D levels have been associated with falls, and low bone mineral density.[67] Taking extra vitamin D, however, does not appear to change the risk.[68] Athletes who are vitamin D deficient are at an increased risk of stress fractures and/or major breaks, particularly those engaging in contact sports. The greatest benefit with supplementation is seen in athletes who are deficient (25(OH)D serum levels <30?ng/ml), or severely deficient (25(OH)D serum levels <25?ng/ml). Incremental decreases in risks are observed with rising serum 25(OH)D concentrations plateauing at 50?ng/ml with no additional benefits seen in levels beyond this point.[69]\\r\\nBecause it found mounting evidence for a benefit to bone health, though it had not found good evidence of other benefits, the US Food and Drug Administration has required manufacturers to declare the amount of vitamin D on nutrition facts labels, as \\"nutrients of public health significance\\", since May 2016. By a proposed deadline extension, small manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales will have to comply by 1 Jan 2021, while larger ones have to comply by 1 Jan 2020.[70]\\r\\nVitamin D supplements have been widely marketed for their claimed anticancer properties.[71] Associations have been shown in observational studies between low vitamin D levels and the risk of development of certain cancers including colon cancer.[72] It is unclear, however, if taking additional vitamin D in the diet or as supplements affects the risk of cancer. Reviews have described the evidence as being \\"inconsistent, inconclusive as to causality, and insufficient to inform nutritional requirements\\"[56] and \\"not sufficiently robust to draw conclusions\\".[65] One 2014 review found that supplements had no significant effect on cancer risk.[13] Another 2014 review concluded that vitamin D3 may decrease the risk of death from cancer (one fewer death in 150 people treated over 5 years), but concerns with the quality of the data were noted.[73] Insufficient evidence exists to recommend vitamin D supplements for people with cancer, although some evidence suggests that low vitamin D may be associated with a worse outcome for some cancers,[74] and that higher 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with better outcomes.[75]\\r\\nTaking vitamin D supplements does not meaningfully reduce the risk of stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cardial infarction, or ischaemic heart disease.[13] Supplementation has no effect on blood pressure.[76]\\r\\nIn general, vitamin D functions to activate the innate and dampen the adaptive immune systems.[77] Deficiency has been linked to increased risk or severity of viral infections, including HIV.[78][79] Low levels of vitamin D appear to be a risk factor for tuberculosis,[80] and historically it was used as a treatment.[81] Supplementation slightly decreases the risk of respiratory tract infections and the exacerbation of asthma.[82][83][84] Evidence is lacking on whether it does so in children under five years of age.[85] No clinical trials have been done to assess its effect on preventing other infections, such as malaria.\\r\\nAlthough tentative data link low levels of vitamin D to asthma, evidence to support a beneficial effect on asthmatics from supplementation is inconclusive.[86] Accordingly, supplementation is not currently recommended for treatment or prevention of asthma.[87] Vitamin D and multiple sclerosis incidence have been linked, but it is not clear what the nature of any causal relationship might be.[88] There is no evidence that vitamin D supplementation is helpful for treating people with multiple sclerosis.[89]\\r\\nLow levels of vitamin D are associated with two major forms of human Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[90] However, further studies are required to determine its significance and the potential role of vitamin D axis in IBD.[90][91]\\r\\nDiabetes -- A systematic review of 2014 concluded that the available studies show no evidence of vitamin D3 supplementation having an effect on glucose homeostasis or diabetes prevention.[92] A review article of 2016 reported that while there is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be a risk factor for diabetes, over-all evidence regarding vitamin D levels and diabetes mellitus is contradictory, requiring further studies.[93]\\r\\nDepression -- Clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for depressive symptoms have generally been of low quality and show no overall effect, although subgroup analysis showed supplementation for participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms or depressive disorder had a moderate effect.[94]\\r\\nCognition and dementia -- A systematic review of clinical studies found an association between low vitamin D levels, and cognitive impairment and a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, lower vitamin D concentrations are also associated with poor nutrition and spending less time outdoors. Therefore, alternative explanations for the increase in cognitive impairment exist and hence a direct causal relationship between vitamin D levels and cognition could not be established.[95]\\r\\nPregnancy -- Low levels of vitamin D in pregnancy are associated with gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and small (for gestational age) infants.[96] Although taking vitamin D supplements during pregnancy raises blood levels of vitamin D in the mother at term,[97] the extent of benefits for the mother or baby is unclear.[96][97][98] Pregnant women who take an adequate amount of vitamin D during gestation may experience a lower risk of pre-eclampsia[97] and positive immune effects.[99] A 2018 review found that supplements may reduce the risk of undersized babies and of their poor rate of growth.[100] Pregnant women often do not take the recommended amount of vitamin D.[99]\\r\\nWeight loss -- Though hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may be an effective treatment for obesity apart from calorie restriction, one systematic review found no association of supplementation with body weight or fat mass.[101] A 2016 meta-analysis found that circulating vitamin D status was improved by weight loss, indicating that fat mass may be inversely associated with blood levels of vitamin D.[102]\\r\\nGovernmental regulatory agencies stipulate for the food and dietary supplement industries certain health claims as allowable as statements on packaging.\\r\\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\\r\\nUS Food and Drug Administration\\r\\nHealth Canada\\r\\nOther possible agencies with claim guidance: Japan FOSHU[107] and Australia-New Zealand.[108]\\r\\nConversion: 1?g = 40?IU.\\r\\nVarious institutions have proposed different recommendations for the amount of daily intake of vitamin D. These vary according to precise definition, age, pregnancy or lactation, and the extent assumptions are made regarding skin synthesis of vitamin D.[56][109][110][111]\\r\\nThe dietary reference intake for vitamin D issued in 2010 by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) for North America superseded previous recommendations which gave adequate intake values. The recommendations were formed assuming the individual has no skin synthesis of vitamin D because of inadequate sun exposure. The reference intake for vitamin D refers to total intake from food, beverages and supplements, and assumes that calcium requirements are being met.[56]:5\\r\\nThe tolerable upper intake level (UL) is defined as \\"the highest average daily intake of a nutrient that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects for nearly all persons in the general population.\\"[56]:403 Although tolerable upper intake levels are believed to be safe, information on the long-term effects is incomplete and these levels of intake are not recommended.[56]:403:433\\r\\nFor U.S food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For vitamin D labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 400 IU (10 g), but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 800 IU (20 g) to bring it into agreement with the RDA.[113] The deadline to be in compliance was extended by the FDA to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.[114]\\r\\nHealth Canada published recommended dietary allowances (RDA) and tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin D in 2012[109] based on the Institute of Medicine report.[56]\\r\\nAustralia and New Zealand published nutrient reference values including guidelines for dietary vitamin D intake in 2005.[110] About a third of Australians have vitamin D deficiency.[115]\\r\\nThe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2016[111] reviewed the current evidence, finding the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentration and musculoskeletal health outcomes is widely variable. They considered that average requirements and population reference intakes values for vitamin D cannot be derived, and that a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L was a suitable target value. For all people over the age of 1, including women who are pregnant or lactating, they set an adequate intake of 15 g/day (600 IU).[111]\\r\\nThe EFSA reviewed safe levels of intake in 2012,[112] setting the tolerable upper limit for adults at 100 g/day (4000 IU), a similar conclusion as the IOM.\\r\\nThe UK National Health Service recommends babies and young children aged six months to five years, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and sun-deprived elderly people should take daily vitamin supplements to ensure sufficient vitamin D intake.[116] In July 2016, Public Health England recommended that everyone consider taking a daily supplement containing 10?g of vitamin D during autumn and winter because of inadequate sunlight for vitamin D synthesis.[117]\\r\\nNon-government organisations in Europe have made their own recommendations. The German Society for Nutrition recommends 20?g.[118] The European Menopause and Andropause Society recommends postmenopausal women consume15?g (600 IU) until age 70, and 20?g (800 IU) from age 71. This dose should be increased to 100?g (4,000 IU) in some patients with very low vitamin D status or in case of co-morbid conditions.[119]\\r\\nAlthough vitamin D is not present naturally in most foods,[2][4] it is commonly added as a fortification in manufactured foods. In some countries, staple foods are artificially fortified with vitamin D.[120]\\r\\nIn general, vitamin D2 is found in fungi and vitamin D3 is found in animals.[121][122] Vitamin D2 is produced by ultraviolet irradiation of ergosterol found in many fungi. The vitamin D2 content in mushrooms and Cladina arbuscula, a lichen, increase with exposure to ultraviolet light.[123][124] This process is emulated by industrial ultraviolet lamps, concentrating vitamin D2 levels to higher levels.[122]\\r\\nThe United States Department of Agriculture reports D2 and D3 content combined in one value.\\r\\nManufactured foods fortified with Vitamin D include some fruit juices and fruit juice drinks, meal replacement energy bars, soy protein-based beverages, certain cheese and cheese products, flour products, infant formulas, many breakfast cereals, and milk.[126][127]\\r\\nIn 2016 in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) amended food additive regulations for milk fortification,[128] stating that vitamin D3 levels not exceed 42 IU vitamin D per 100 g (400 IU per US quart) of dairy milk, 84 IU of vitamin D2 per 100 g (800 IU per quart) of plant milks, and 89 IU per 100 g (800 IU per quart) in plant-based yogurts.[129] Plant milks are defined as beverages made from soy, almond, rice, among other plant sources intended as alternatives to dairy milk.\\r\\nWhile some studies have found that vitamin D3 raises 25(OH)D blood levels faster and remains active in the body longer,[130][131] others contend that vitamin D2 sources are equally bioavailable and effective as D3 for raising and sustaining 25(OH)D.[122][132][133]\\r\\nVitamin D content in typical foods is reduced variably by cooking. Boiled, fried and baked foods retained 69ÿ89% of original vitamin D.[134]\\r\\nRecommendations on recommended 25(OH)D serum levels vary across authorities, and vary based on factors like age.[5] US labs generally report 25(OH)D levels in ng/ml. Other countries often use nmol/L. One?ng/ml is approximately equal to 2.5?nmol/L.\\r\\nA 2014 review concluded that the most advantageous serum levels for 25(OH)D for all outcomes appeared to be close to 30?ng/ml (75 nmol/L).[135] The optimal vitamin D levels are still controversial and another review concluded that ranges from 30 to 40?ng/ml (75 to 100?nmol/L) were to be recommended for athletes.[136] Part of the controversy is because numerous studies have found differences in serum levels of 25(OH)D between ethnic groups; studies point to genetic as well as environmental reasons behind these variations.[137] Supplementation to achieve these standard levels could cause harmful vascular calcification.[50]\\r\\nA 2012 meta-analysis showed that the risk of cardiovascular diseases increases when blood levels of vitamin D are lowest in a range of 8 to 24?ng/ml (20 to 60?nmol/L), although results among the studies analyzed were inconsistent.[138]\\r\\nIn 2011 an IOM committee concluded a serum 25(OH)D level of 20?ng/ml (50?nmol/L) is needed for bone and overall health. The dietary reference intakes for vitamin D are chosen with a margin of safety and 'overshoot' the targeted serum value to ensure the specified levels of intake achieve the desired serum 25(OH)D levels in almost all persons. No contributions to serum 25(OH)D level are assumed from sun exposure and the recommendations are fully applicable to people with dark skin or negligible exposure to sunlight. The Institute found serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 30?ng/ml (75?nmol/L) are \\"not consistently associated with increased benefit\\". Serum 25(OH)D levels above 50?ng/ml (125?nmol/L) may be cause for concern. However, some people with serum 25(OH)D between 30 and 50?ng/ml (75?nmol/L-125?nmol/L) will also have inadequate vitamin D.[56]\\r\\nVitamin D toxicity is rare.[24] It is caused by supplementing with high doses of vitamin D rather than sunlight. The threshold for vitamin D toxicity has not been established; however, according to some research, the tolerable upper intake level (UL) is 4,000 IU/day for ages 9ÿ71[139] (100?g/day), while other research concludes that, in healthy adults, sustained intake of more than 1250?g/day (50,000?IU) can produce overt toxicity after several months and can increase serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to 150?ng/ml and greater.[24][140] Those with certain medical conditions, such as primary hyperparathyroidism,[141] are far more sensitive to vitamin D and develop hypercalcemia in response to any increase in vitamin D nutrition, while maternal hypercalcemia during pregnancy may increase fetal sensitivity to effects of vitamin D and lead to a syndrome of mental retardation and facial deformities.[141][142]\\r\\nA review published in 2015 noted that adverse effects have been reported only at 25(OH)D serum concentrations above 200 nmol/L.[136]\\r\\nPublished cases of toxicity involving hypercalcemia in which the vitamin D dose and the 25-hydroxy-vitamin D levels are known all involve an intake of 40,000?IU (1,000?g) per day.[141]\\r\\nPregnant or breastfeeding women should consult a doctor before taking a vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that droppers accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 25?ng cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the dropper hold no more than 400 IU.[143] For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25?g/day (1,000?IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month.[140] After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) as of 30?November?2010[update], has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500?IU per day for ages 1ÿ3 years, 3,000?IU per day for ages 4ÿ8 years and 4,000?IU per day for ages 9ÿ71+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).[139]\\r\\nCalcitriol itself is auto-regulated in a negative feedback cycle, and is also affected by parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23, cytokines, calcium, and phosphate.[144]\\r\\nVitamin D overdose causes hypercalcemia, which is a strong indication of vitamin D toxicity ÿ this can be noted with an increase in urination and thirst. If hypercalcemia is not treated, it results in excess deposits of calcium in soft tissues and organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart, resulting in pain and organ damage.[24][27][44]\\r\\nThe main symptoms of vitamin D overdose which are those of hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. These may be followed by polyuria, polydipsia, weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. Furthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop.[140] Other symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.[24][44]\\r\\nVitamin D toxicity is treated by discontinuing vitamin D supplementation and restricting calcium intake. Kidney damage may be irreversible. Exposure to sunlight for extended periods of time does not normally cause vitamin D toxicity. The concentrations of vitamin D precursors produced in the skin reach an equilibrium, and any further vitamin D produced is degraded.[141]\\r\\nSynthesis of vitamin D in nature is dependent on the presence of UV radiation and subsequent activation in liver and in kidney. Many animals synthesize vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol, and many fungi synthesize vitamin D2 from ergosterol.[121][122]\\r\\nClick on icon in lower right corner to open. Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. [ 1]\\r\\nThe transformation that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 occurs in two steps.[145][146] First, 7-dehydrocholesterol is photolyzed by ultraviolet light in a 6-electron conrotatory ring-opening electrocyclic reaction; the product is previtamin?D3. Second, previtamin?D3 spontaneously isomerizes to vitamin?D3 (cholecalciferol) in an antarafacial sigmatropic [1,7] hydride shift. At room temperature, the transformation of previtamin?D3 to vitamin D3 in an organic solvent takes about 12 days to complete. The conversion of previtamin?D3 to vitamin D3 in the skin is about 10 times faster than in an organic solvent.[147]\\r\\nThe conversion from ergosterol to vitamin D2 follows a similar procedure, forming previtamin?D2 by photolysis, which isomerizes to vitamin D2.[148] The transformation of previtamin?D2 to vitamin D2 in methanol has a rate comparable to that of previtamin?D3. The process is faster in white button mushrooms.[149](fig. 3)\\r\\nVitamin D3 is produced photochemically from 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin of most vertebrate animals, including humans.[150] The precursor of vitamin D3, 7-dehydrocholesterol is produced in relatively large quantities. 7-Dehydrocholesterol reacts with UVB light at wavelengths between 270 and 300?nm, with peak synthesis occurring between 295 and 297?nm.[151] These wavelengths are present in sunlight, as well as in the light emitted by the UV lamps in tanning beds (which produce ultraviolet primarily in the UVA spectrum, but typically produce 4% to 10% of the total UV emissions as UVB). Exposure to light through windows is insufficient because glass almost completely blocks UVB light.[152][153]\\r\\nAdequate amounts of vitamin D can be produced with moderate sun exposure to the face, arms and legs, averaging 5ÿ30 minutes twice per week, or approximately 25% of the time for minimal sunburn. The darker the skin, and the weaker the sunlight, the more minutes of exposure are needed. Vitamin D overdose is impossible from UV exposure; the skin reaches an equilibrium where the vitamin degrades as fast as it is created.[24][154][155]\\r\\nSunscreen absorbs or reflects ultraviolet light and prevents much of it from reaching the skin.[156] Sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 8 based on the UVB spectrum decreases vitamin D synthetic capacity by 95%, and SPF 15 decreases it by 98%.[157]\\r\\nThe skin consists of two primary layers: the inner layer called the dermis, composed largely of connective tissue, and the outer, thinner epidermis.[158] Thick epidermis in the soles and palms consists of five strata; from outer to inner, they are: the stratum corneum, stratum lucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale. Vitamin D is produced in the keratinocytes[159] of two innermost strata, the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.[156]\\r\\nVitamin D can be synthesized only by a photochemical process. Phytoplankton in the ocean (such as coccolithophore and Emiliania huxleyi) have been photosynthesizing vitamin D for more than 500 million years. Primitive vertebrates in the ocean could absorb calcium from the ocean into their skeletons and eat plankton rich in vitamin D.\\r\\nLand vertebrates required another source of vitamin D other than plants for their calcified skeletons. They had to either ingest it or be exposed to sunlight to photosynthesize it in their skin.[121][147] Land vertebrates have been photosynthesizing vitamin D for more than 350 million years.[160]\\r\\nIn birds and fur-bearing mammals, fur or feathers block UV rays from reaching the skin. Instead, vitamin D is created from oily secretions of the skin deposited onto the feathers or fur, and is obtained orally during grooming.[161] However, some animals, such as the naked mole-rat, are naturally cholecalciferol-deficient, as serum 25-OH vitamin D levels are undetectable.[162]\\r\\nVitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is produced industrially by exposing 7-dehydrocholesterol to UVB light, followed by purification.[163] The 7-dehydrocholesterol is a natural substance in fish organs, especially the liver,[164] or in wool grease (lanolin) from sheep. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is produced in a similar way using ergosterol from yeast or mushrooms as a starting material.[163][122]\\r\\nVitamin D is carried in the bloodstream to the liver, where it is converted into the prohormone calcifediol. Circulating calcifediol may then be converted into calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D, in the kidneys.[165]\\r\\nWhether it is made in the skin or ingested, Vitamin D is hydroxylated in the liver at position 25 (upper right of the molecule) to form 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol or 25(OH)D).[166] This reaction is catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme vitamin D 25-hydroxylase, the product of the CYP2R1 human gene, and expressed by hepatocytes.[167] Once made, the product is released into the plasma, where it is bound to an ϫ-globulin carrier protein named the vitamin D-binding protein.[168]\\r\\nCalcifediol is transported to the proximal tubules of the kidneys, where it is hydroxylated at the 1-ϫ position (lower right of the molecule) to form calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, 1,25(OH)2D). The conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol is catalyzed by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase, which is the product of the CYP27B1 human gene. The activity of CYP27B1 is increased by parathyroid hormone, and also by low calcium or phosphate.[4][165]\\r\\nFollowing the final converting step in the kidney, calcitriol is released into the circulation. By binding to vitamin D-binding protein, calcitriol is transported throughout the body, including to the classical target organs of intestine, kidney and bone.[15] Calcitriol is the most potent natural ligand of the vitamin D receptor, which mediates most of the physiological actions of vitamin D.[4][165]\\r\\nIn addition to the kidneys, calcitriol is also synthesized by certain other cells including monocyte-macrophages in the immune system. When synthesized by monocyte-macrophages, calcitriol acts locally as a cytokine, modulating body defenses against microbial invaders by stimulating the innate immune system.[165]\\r\\nThe activity of calcifediol and calcitriol can be reduced by hydroxylation at position 24 by vitamin D3 24-hydroxylase, forming secalciferol and calcitetrol respecively.[166]\\r\\nVitamin?D2 (ergocalciferol) and Vitamin?D3 (cholecaliferol) share a similar mechanism of action as outlined above.[166] Metabolites produced by vitamin D2 is sometimes named with a er- or ergo prefix to differentiate them from the D3-based counterparts.[169] Nevertheless, these differences are present in the metabolism of Vitamin?D2 and Vitamin?D3:[166]\\r\\nAmerican researchers Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis in 1914[9] discovered a substance in cod liver oil which later was called \\"vitamin A\\". British doctor Edward Mellanby noticed dogs that were fed cod liver oil did not develop rickets and concluded vitamin A, or a closely associated factor, could prevent the disease. In 1922, Elmer McCollum tested modified cod liver oil in which the vitamin A had been destroyed.[9] The modified oil cured the sick dogs, so McCollum concluded the factor in cod liver oil which cured rickets was distinct from vitamin A. He called it vitamin D because it was the fourth vitamin to be named.[172][173][174] It was not initially realized that, unlike other vitamins, vitamin D can be synthesised by humans through exposure to UV light.\\r\\nIn 1925,[9] it was established that when 7-dehydrocholesterol is irradiated with light, a form of a fat-soluble vitamin is produced (now known as D3). Alfred Fabian Hess stated: \\"Light equals vitamin D.\\"[175] Adolf Windaus, at the University of G?ttingen in Germany, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1928 for his work on the constitution of sterols and their connection with vitamins.[176] In 1929, a group at NIMR in Hampstead, London, were working on the structure of vitamin D, which was still unknown, as well as the structure of steroids. A meeting took place with J.B.S. Haldane, J.D. Bernal, and Dorothy Crowfoot to discuss possible structures, which contributed to bringing a team together. X-ray crystallography demonstrated the sterol molecules were flat, not as proposed by the German team led by Windaus. In 1932, Otto Rosenheim and Harold King published a paper putting forward structures for sterols and bile acids which found immediate acceptance.[177] The informal academic collaboration between the team members Robert Benedict Bourdillon, Otto Rosenheim, Harold King, and Kenneth Callow was very productive and led to the isolation and characterization of vitamin D.[178] At this time, the policy of the Medical Research Council was not to patent discoveries, believing the results of medical research should be open to everybody. In the 1930s, Windaus clarified further the chemical structure of vitamin D.[179]\\r\\nIn 1923, American biochemist Harry Steenbock at the University of Wisconsin demonstrated that irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials.[180] After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered the rodents were cured of rickets. A vitamin D deficiency is a known cause of rickets. Using $300 of his own money, Steenbock patented his invention. His irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, most memorably for milk. By the expiration of his patent in 1945, rickets had been all but eliminated in the US.[181]\\r\\nIn 1969, after studying nuclear fragments of intestinal cells, a specific binding protein for Vitamin D called the Vitamin D Receptor was identified by Mark Haussler and Tony Norman.[182] In 1971ÿ72, the further metabolism of vitamin D to active forms was discovered. In the liver, vitamin D was found to be converted to calcifediol. Calcifediol is then converted by the kidneys to calcitriol, the biologically active form of vitamin D.[8] Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of bone. The vitamin D metabolites, calcifediol and calcitriol, were identified by competing teams led by Michael F. Holick in the laboratory of Hector DeLuca and by Tony Norman and colleagues.[183][184][185]\\r\\nThere is considerable research activity looking at effects of vitamin D and its metabolites in animal models, cell systems, gene expression studies, epidemiology and clinical therapeutics. These different types of studies can produce conflicting evidence as to the benefits of interventions with vitamin D.[186] One school of thought contends the human physiology is fine-tuned to an intake of 4,000ÿ12,000?IU/day from sun exposure with concomitant serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of 40 to 80?ng/ml[187] and this is required for optimal health. Proponents of this view, who include some members of the panel that drafted a now-superseded 1997 report on vitamin D from the IOM, contend the IOM's warning about serum concentrations above 50?ng/ml lacks biological plausibility. They suggest, for some people, reducing the risk of preventable disease requires a higher level of vitamin D than that recommended by the IOM.[187][188]\\r\\nThe United States National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements established a Vitamin D Initiative in 2014 to track current research and provide education to consumers.[189] In their 2016 review, they recognise that a growing body of research suggests that vitamin D might play some role in the prevention and treatment of types 1 and 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance, hypertension, multiple sclerosis, and other medical conditions. They state further: \\"however, most evidence for these roles comes from in vitro, animal, and epidemiological studies, not the randomized clinical trials considered to be more definitive. Until such trials are conducted, the implications of the available evidence for public health and patient care will be debated\\".[5]\\r\\nSome preliminary studies link low vitamin D levels with disease later in life.[190] Evidence as of 2013 is insufficient to determine whether vitamin D affects the risk of cancer.[191] One meta-analysis found a decrease in mortality in elderly people.[12] Another meta-analysis covering over 350,000 people concluded that vitamin D supplementation in unselected community-dwelling individuals does not reduce skeletal (total fracture) or non-skeletal outcomes (myocardial infarction, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, cerebrovascular disease, cancer) by more than 15%, and that further research trials with similar design are unlikely to change these conclusions.[13]\\r\\nVitamin D deficiency is widespread in the European population.[192] European research is assessing vitamin D intake levels in association with disease rates and policies of dietary recommendations, food fortification, vitamin D supplementation, and small amounts of sun exposure.[127]\\r\\nApart from VDR activation, various alternative mechanisms of action are under study, such as inhibition of signal transduction by hedgehog, a hormone involved in morphogenesis.[193]","input":"What is the active form of vit d?"},{"output":"11 January 1896","context":"X-rays make up X-radiation, a form of electromagnetic radiation. Most X-rays have a wavelength ranging from 0.01 to 10 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3G1016 Hz to 3G1019 Hz) and energies in the range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-ray wavelengths are shorter than those of UV rays and typically longer than those of gamma rays. In many languages, X-radiation is referred to with terms meaning R?ntgen radiation, after the German scientist Wilhelm R?ntgen,[1] who usually is credited as its discoverer, and who named it X-radiation to signify an unknown type of radiation.[2] Spelling of X-ray(s) in the English language includes the variants x-ray(s), xray(s), and X ray(s).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman physicist Wilhelm R?ntgen is usually credited as the discoverer of X-rays in 1895, because he was the first to systematically study them, though he is not the first to have observed their effects. He is also the one who gave them the name \\"X-rays\\" (signifying an unknown quantity[4]) though many others referred to these as \\"R?ntgen rays\\" (and the associated X-ray radiograms as, \\"R?ntgenograms\\") for several decades after their discovery and even to this day in some languages, including R?ntgen's native German.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays were found emanating from Crookes tubes, experimental discharge tubes invented around 1875, by scientists investigating the cathode rays, which are energetic electron beams that were first created in the tubes. Crookes tubes created free electrons by ionization of the residual air in the tube by a high DC voltage of anywhere between a few kilovolts and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the cathode to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the anode or the glass wall of the tube. Many of the early Crookes tubes undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Wilhelm R?ntgen was the first to systematically study them, in 1895.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of X-rays stimulated a veritable sensation. R?ntgen's biographer Otto Glasser estimated that, in 1896 alone, as many as 49 essays and 1044 articles about the new rays were published.[8] This was probably a conservative estimate, if one considers that nearly every paper around the world extensively reported about the new discovery, with a magazine such as Science dedicating as many as 23 articles to it in that year alone.[9] Sensationalist reactions to the new discovery included publications linking the new kind of rays to occult and paranormal theories, such as telepathy.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest experimenter thought to have (unknowingly) produced X-rays was actuary William Morgan. In 1785 he presented a paper to the Royal Society of London describing the effects of passing electrical currents through a partially evacuated glass tube, producing a glow created by X-rays.[12] This work was further explored by Humphry Davy and his assistant Michael Faraday.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1877 Ukrainian-born Ivan Pulyui, a lecturer in experimental physics at the University of Vienna, constructed various designs of vacuum discharge tube to investigate their properties.[13] He continued his investigations when appointed professor at the Prague Polytechnic and in 1886 he found that sealed photographic plates became dark when exposed to the emanations from the tubes. Early in 1896, just a few weeks after R?ntgen published his first X-ray photograph, Pulyui published high-quality X-ray images in journals in Paris and London.[13] Although Pulyui had studied with R?ntgen at the University of Strasbourg in the years 1873ÿ75, his biographer Gaida (1997) asserts that his subsequent research was conducted independently.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays were generated and detected by Fernando Sanford (1854ÿ1948), the foundation Professor of Physics at Stanford University, in 1891. From 1886 to 1888 he had studied in the Hermann Helmholtz laboratory in Berlin, where he became familiar with the cathode rays generated in vacuum tubes when a voltage was applied across separate electrodes, as previously studied by Heinrich Hertz and Philipp Lenard. His letter of January 6, 1893 (describing his discovery as \\"electric photography\\") to The Physical Review was duly published and an article entitled Without Lens or Light, Photographs Taken With Plate and Object in Darkness appeared in the San Francisco Examiner.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 1888, Philipp Lenard, a student of Heinrich Hertz, conducted experiments to see whether cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air. He built a Crookes tube (later called a \\"Lenard tube\\") with a \\"window\\" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it. He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials. It has been suggested that at least some of these \\"Lenard rays\\" were actually X-rays.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nHermann von Helmholtz formulated mathematical equations for X-rays. He postulated a dispersion theory before R?ntgen made his discovery and announcement. It was formed on the basis of the electromagnetic theory of light.[16] However, he did not work with actual X-rays.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1894 Nikola Tesla noticed damaged film in his lab that seemed to be associated with Crookes tube experiments and began investigating this radiant energy of \\"invisible\\" kinds.[17][18] After R?ntgen identified the X-ray Tesla began making X-ray images of his own using high voltages and tubes of his own design,[19] as well as Crookes tubes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 1896, the inventor Dr. Robert D'Unger proposed a X-Ray telephot, supposed able to make transmission of pictures by telegraph wire.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 8, 1895, German physics professor Wilhelm R?ntgen stumbled on X-rays while experimenting with Lenard and Crookes tubes and began studying them. He wrote an initial report \\"On a new kind of ray: A preliminary communication\\" and on December 28, 1895 submitted it to Wrzburg's Physical-Medical Society journal.[21] This was the first paper written on X-rays. R?ntgen referred to the radiation as \\"X\\", to indicate that it was an unknown type of radiation. The name stuck, although (over R?ntgen's great objections) many of his colleagues suggested calling them R?ntgen rays. They are still referred to as such in many languages, including German, Hungarian, Danish, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Estonian, Russian, Japanese, Dutch, Georgian and Norwegian. R?ntgen received the first Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are conflicting accounts of his discovery because R?ntgen had his lab notes burned after his death, but this is a likely reconstruction by his biographers:[23][24] R?ntgen was investigating cathode rays from a Crookes tube which he had wrapped in black cardboard so that the visible light from the tube would not interfere, using a fluorescent screen painted with barium platinocyanide. He noticed a faint green glow from the screen, about 1 meter away. R?ntgen realized some invisible rays coming from the tube were passing through the cardboard to make the screen glow. He found they could also pass through books and papers on his desk. R?ntgen threw himself into investigating these unknown rays systematically. Two months after his initial discovery, he published his paper.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nR?ntgen discovered their medical use when he made a picture of his wife's hand on a photographic plate formed due to X-rays. The photograph of his wife's hand was the first photograph of a human body part using X-rays. When she saw the picture, she said \\"I have seen my death.\\"[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was immediate interest from researchers for the X-ray. A. A. Campbell-Swinton and Nikola Tesla were amongst the firsts to test the new discovery. In 1896, Thomas Edison investigated materials' ability to fluoresce when exposed to X-rays, and found that calcium tungstate was the most effective substance. Around March 1896, the fluoroscope he developed became the standard for medical X-ray examinations. Nevertheless, Edison dropped X-ray research around 1903, even before the death of Clarence Madison Dally, one of his glassblowers. Dally had a habit of testing X-ray tubes on his hands, and acquired a cancer in them so tenacious that both arms were amputated in a futile attempt to save his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use of X-rays under clinical conditions was by John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England on 11 January 1896, when he radiographed a needle stuck in the hand of an associate.[26] On February 14, 1896 Hall-Edwards was also the first to use X-rays in a surgical operation.[27] In early 1896, several weeks after R?ntgen's discovery, Ivan Romanovich Tarkhanov irradiated frogs and insects with X-rays, concluding that the rays \\"not only photograph, but also affect the living function\\".[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first medical X-ray made in the United States was obtained using a discharge tube of Pulyui's design. In January 1896, on reading of R?ntgen's discovery, Frank Austin of Dartmouth College tested all of the discharge tubes in the physics laboratory and found that only the Pulyui tube produced X-rays. This was a result of Pulyui's inclusion of an oblique \\"target\\" of mica, used for holding samples of fluorescent material, within the tube. On 3 February 1896 Gilman Frost, professor of medicine at the college, and his brother Edwin Frost, professor of physics, exposed the wrist of Eddie McCarthy, whom Gilman had treated some weeks earlier for a fracture, to the X-rays and collected the resulting image of the broken bone on gelatin photographic plates obtained from Howard Langill, a local photographer also interested in R?ntgen's work.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1901, U.S. President William McKinley was shot twice in an assassination attempt. While one bullet only grazed his sternum, another had lodged somewhere deep inside his abdomen and could not be found. A worried McKinley aide sent word to inventor Thomas Edison to rush an X-ray machine to Buffalo to find the stray bullet. It arrived but wasn't used. While the shooting itself had not been lethal, gangrene had developed along the path of the bullet, and McKinley died of septic shock due to bacterial infection six days later.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the widespread experimentation with x?rays after their discovery in 1895 by scientists, physicians, and inventors came many stories of burns, hair loss, and worse in technical journals of the time. In February 1896, Professor John Daniel and Dr. William Lofland Dudley of Vanderbilt University reported hair loss after Dr. Dudley was X-rayed. A child who had been shot in the head was brought to the Vanderbilt laboratory in 1896. Before trying to find the bullet an experiment was attempted, for which Dudley \\"with his characteristic devotion to science\\"[31][32][33] volunteered. Daniel reported that 21 days after taking a picture of Dudley's skull (with an exposure time of one hour), he noticed a bald spot 2 inches (5.1?cm) in diameter on the part of his head nearest the X-ray tube: \\"A plate holder with the plates towards the side of the skull was fastened and a coin placed between the skull and the head. The tube was fastened at the other side at a distance of one-half inch from the hair.\\"[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1896 Dr. HD. Hawks, a graduate of Columbia College, suffered severe hand and chest burns from an x-ray demonstration. It was reported in Electrical Review and led to many other reports of problems associated with x-rays being sent in to the publication.[35] Many experimenters including Elihu Thomson at Edison's lab, William J. Morton, and Nikola Tesla also reported burns. Elihu Thomson deliberately exposed a finger to an x-ray tube over a period of time and suffered pain, swelling, and blistering.[36] Other effects were sometimes blamed for the damage including ultraviolet rays and (according to Tesla) ozone.[37] Many physicians claimed there were no effects from X-ray exposure at all.[36]\\r\\nOn August 3, 1905 at San Francisco, California, Elizabeth Fleischman, American woman X-ray pioneer, died from complications as a result of her work with X-rays.[38][39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation cold cathode or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate \\"harder\\" X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as \\"softeners\\". These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of mica, a mineral that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1904, John Ambrose Fleming invented the thermionic diode, the first kind of vacuum tube. This used a hot cathode that caused an electric current to flow in a vacuum. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called \\"Coolidge tubes\\", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn about 1906, the physicist Charles Barkla discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic X-ray spectrum. He won the 1917 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1912, Max von Laue, Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the diffraction of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of Paul Peter Ewald, William Henry Bragg, and William Lawrence Bragg, gave birth to the field of X-ray crystallography.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Coolidge X-ray tube was invented during the following year by William D. Coolidge. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. X-ray tubes similar to this are still in use in 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of radiation therapy) was pioneered by Major John Hall-Edwards in Birmingham, England. Then in 1908, he had to have his left arm amputated because of the spread of X-ray dermatitis on his arm.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1914 Marie Curie developed radiological cars to support soldiers injured in World War I. The cars would allow for rapid X-ray imaging of wounded soldiers so battlefield surgeons could quickly and more accurately operate.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the 1920s through to the 1950s, x-ray machines were developed to assist in the fitting of shoes and were sold to commercial shoe stores.[43][44][45] Concerns regarding the impact of frequent or poorly controlled use were expressed in the 1950s,[46][47] leading to the practise's eventual end that decade.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe X-ray microscope was developed during the 1950s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chandra X-ray Observatory, launched on July 23, 1999, has been allowing the exploration of the very violent processes in the universe which produce X-rays. Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable. It features stars being torn apart by black holes, galactic collisions, and novae, and neutron stars that build up layers of plasma that then explode into space.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn X-ray laser device was proposed as part of the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s, but the only test of the device (a sort of laser \\"blaster\\" or death ray, powered by a thermonuclear explosion) gave inconclusive results. For technical and political reasons, the overall project (including the X-ray laser) was de-funded (though was later revived by the second Bush Administration as National Missile Defense using different technologies).\\r\\n\\r\\nPhase-contrast X-ray imaging refers to a variety of techniques that use phase information of a coherent x-ray beam to image soft tissues. It has become an important method for visualizing cellular and histological structures in a wide range of biological and medical studies. There are several technologies being used for x-ray phase-contrast imaging, all utilizing different principles to convert phase variations in the x-rays emerging from an object into intensity variations.[49][50] These include propagation-based phase contrast,[51] talbot interferometry,[50] refraction-enhanced imaging,[52] and x-ray interferometry.[53] These methods provide higher contrast compared to normal absorption-contrast x-ray imaging, making it possible to see smaller details. A disadvantage is that these methods require more sophisticated equipment, such as synchrotron or microfocus x-ray sources, X-ray optics, and high resolution x-ray detectors.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays with high photon energies (above 5ÿ10 keV, below 0.2ÿ0.1?nm wavelength) are called hard X-rays, while those with lower energy (and longer wavelength) are called soft X-rays.[54] Due to their penetrating ability, hard X-rays are widely used to image the inside of objects, e.g., in medical radiography and airport security. The term X-ray is metonymically used to refer to a radiographic image produced using this method, in addition to the method itself. Since the wavelengths of hard X-rays are similar to the size of atoms, they are also useful for determining crystal structures by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, soft X-rays are easily absorbed in air; the attenuation length of 600 eV (~2?nm) X-rays in water is less than 1 micrometer.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no consensus for a definition distinguishing between X-rays and gamma rays. One common practice is to distinguish between the two types of radiation based on their source: X-rays are emitted by electrons, while gamma rays are emitted by the atomic nucleus.[56][57][58][59] This definition has several problems: other processes also can generate these high-energy photons, or sometimes the method of generation is not known. One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10?11 m (0.1 ?), defined as gamma radiation.[60]\\r\\nThis criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is only possible if wavelength is known. (Some measurement techniques do not distinguish between detected wavelengths.) However, these two definitions often coincide since the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes generally has a longer wavelength and lower photon energy than the radiation emitted by radioactive nuclei.[56]\\r\\nOccasionally, one term or the other is used in specific contexts due to historical precedent, based on measurement (detection) technique, or based on their intended use rather than their wavelength or source.\\r\\nThus, gamma-rays generated for medical and industrial uses, for example radiotherapy, in the ranges of 6ÿ20 MeV, can in this context also be referred to as X-rays.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nX-ray photons carry enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds. This makes it a type of ionizing radiation, and therefore harmful to living tissue. A very high radiation dose over a short period of time causes radiation sickness, while lower doses can give an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer. In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be utilized in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy. It is also used for material characterization using X-ray spectroscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much absorbed or scattered. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to image the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical radiography and airport security scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. industrial radiography and industrial CT scanning) and research (e.g. small animal CT). The penetration depth varies with several orders of magnitude over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient transmission through the object and at the same time provide good contrast in the image.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal microscope. This property is used in X-ray microscopy to acquire high resolution images, and also in X-ray crystallography to determine the positions of atoms in crystals.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through photoabsorption, Compton scattering, and Rayleigh scattering. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to Z3/E3, where Z is the atomic number and E is the energy of the incident photon.[61] This rule is not valid close to inner shell electron binding energies where there are abrupt changes in interaction probability, so called absorption edges. However, the general trend of high absorption coefficients and thus short penetration depths for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26 keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of calcium (Z=20) in bones together with their high density is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic photon[clarification needed] or an Auger electron. These effects can be used for elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.[62] Compton scattering is an inelastic scattering of the X-ray photon by an outer shell electron. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the KleinÿNishina formula. The transferred energy can be directly obtained from the scattering angle from the conservation of energy and momentum.\\r\\n\\r\\nRayleigh scattering is the dominant elastic scattering mechanism in the X-ray regime.[63] Inelastic forward scattering gives rise to the refractive index, which for X-rays is only slightly below 1.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhenever charged particles (electrons or ions) of sufficient energy hit a material, X-rays are produced.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays can be generated by an X-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses a high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the X-rays.[67] In medical X-ray tubes the target is usually tungsten or a more crack-resistant alloy of rhenium (5%) and tungsten (95%), but sometimes molybdenum for more specialized applications, such as when softer X-rays are needed as in mammography. In crystallography, a copper target is most common, with cobalt often being used when fluorescence from iron content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe maximum energy of the produced X-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80?kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80?keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent, and thus most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nShort nanosecond bursts of X-rays peaking at 15-keV in energy may be reliably produced by peeling pressure-sensitive adhesive tape from its backing in a moderate vacuum. This is likely to be the result of recombination of electrical charges produced by triboelectric charging. The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.[69]\\r\\n\\r\\nA specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization.[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays can also be produced by fast protons or other positive ions. The proton-induced X-ray emission or particle-induced X-ray emission is widely used as an analytical procedure. For high energies, the production cross section is proportional to Z12Z2?4, where Z1 refers to the atomic number of the ion, Z2 to that of the target atom.[71]\\r\\nAn overview of these cross sections is given in the same reference.\\r\\n\\r\\nX-rays are also produced in lightning accompanying terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. The underlying mechanism is the acceleration of electrons in lightning related electric fields and the subsequent production of photons through Bremsstrahlung.[72] This produces photons with energies of some few keV and several tens of MeV.[73] In laboratory discharges with a gap size of approximately 1 meter length and a peak voltage of 1 MV, X-rays with a characteristic energy of 160 keV are observed.[74] A possible explanation is the encounter of two streamers and the production of high-energy run-away electrons;[75] however, microscopic simulations have shown that the duration of electric field enhancement between two streamers is too short to produce a significantly number of run-away electrons.[76]Recently, it has been proposed that air perturbations in the vicinity of streamers can facilitate the production of run-away electrons and hence of X-rays from discharges.[77] [78]\\r\\n\\r\\nX-ray detectors vary in shape and function depending on their purpose. Imaging detectors such as those used for radiography were originally based on photographic plates and later photographic film, but are now mostly replaced by various digital detector types such as image plates and flat panel detectors. For radiation protection direct exposure hazard is often evaluated using ionization chambers, while dosimeters are used to measure the radiation dose a person has been exposed to. X-ray spectra can be measured either by energy dispersive or wavelength dispersive spectrometers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince R?ntgen's discovery that X-rays can identify bone structures, X-rays have been used for medical imaging. The first medical use was less than a month after his paper on the subject.[29] Up to 2010, 5?billion medical imaging examinations had been conducted worldwide.[79] Radiation exposure from medical imaging in 2006 made up about 50% of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States.[80]\\r\\n\\r\\nProjectional radiography is the practice of producing two-dimensional images using x-ray radiation. Bones contain much calcium, which due to its relatively high atomic number absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.\\r\\n\\r\\nProjectional radiographs are useful in the detection of pathology of the skeletal system as well as for detecting some disease processes in soft tissue. Some notable examples are the very common chest X-ray, which can be used to identify lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or pulmonary edema, and the abdominal x-ray, which can detect bowel (or intestinal) obstruction, free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in ascites). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as gallstones (which are rarely radiopaque) or kidney stones which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the brain or muscle. One area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic implant, such as a knee, hip or shoulder replacement, is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone. This can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs, or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called '2D to 3D registration' is used. This technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs.[81][82]\\r\\n\\r\\nDental radiography is commonly used in the diagnoses of common oral problems, such as cavities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn medical diagnostic applications, the low energy (soft) X-rays are unwanted, since they are totally absorbed by the body, increasing the radiation dose without contributing to the image. Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of aluminium, called an X-ray filter, is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called hardening the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo generate an image of the cardiovascular system, including the arteries and veins (angiography) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated contrast agent has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The radiologist or surgeon then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nComputed tomography (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where tomographic images or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.[83] These cross-sectional images can be combined into a three-dimensional image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.\\r\\n\\r\\nFluoroscopy is an imaging technique commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders and swallowing disorders).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of X-rays as a treatment is known as radiation therapy and is largely used for the management (including palliation) of cancer; it requires higher radiation doses than those received for imaging alone. X-rays beams are used for treating skin cancers using lower energy x-ray beams while higher energy beams are used for treating cancers within the body such as brain, lung, prostate, and breast.[84][85]\\r\\n\\r\\nDiagnostic X-rays (primarily from CT scans due to the large dose used) increase the risk of developmental problems and cancer in those exposed.[86][87][88] X-rays are classified as a carcinogen by both the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer and the U.S. government.[79][89] It is estimated that 0.4% of current cancers in the United States are due to computed tomography (CT scans) performed in the past and that this may increase to as high as 1.5-2% with 2007 rates of CT usage.[90]\\r\\n\\r\\nExperimental and epidemiological data currently do not support the proposition that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.[91] However, this is under increasing doubt.[92] It is estimated that the additional radiation will increase a person's cumulative risk of getting cancer by age 75 by 0.6ÿ1.8%.[93] The amount of absorbed radiation depends upon the type of X-ray test and the body part involved.[94] CT and fluoroscopy entail higher doses of radiation than do plain X-rays.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo place the increased risk in perspective, a plain chest X-ray will expose a person to the same amount from background radiation that people are exposed to (depending upon location) every day over 10 days, while exposure from a dental X-ray is approximately equivalent to 1 day of environmental background radiation.[95] Each such X-ray would add less than 1 per 1,000,000 to the lifetime cancer risk. An abdominal or chest CT would be the equivalent to 2ÿ3 years of background radiation to the whole body, or 4ÿ5 years to the abdomen or chest, increasing the lifetime cancer risk between 1 per 1,000 to 1 per 10,000.[95] This is compared to the roughly 40% chance of a US citizen developing cancer during their lifetime.[96] For instance, the effective dose to the torso from a CT scan of the chest is about 5 mSv, and the absorbed dose is about 14 mGy.[97] A head CT scan (1.5mSv, 64mGy)[98] that is performed once with and once without contrast agent, would be equivalent to 40 years of background radiation to the head. Accurate estimation of effective doses due to CT is difficult with the estimation uncertainty range of about I19% to I32% for adult head scans depending upon the method used.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe risk of radiation is greater to a fetus, so in pregnant patients, the benefits of the investigation (X-ray) should be balanced with the potential hazards to the fetus.[100][101] In the US, there are an estimated 62?million CT scans performed annually, including more than 4?million on children.[94] Avoiding unnecessary X-rays (especially CT scans) reduces radiation dose and any associated cancer risk.[102]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical X-rays are a significant source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the United States. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of total American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.[80][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nDosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital). Depending on the procedure and the technology, a single dental X-ray of a human results in an exposure of 0.5 to 4 mrem. A full mouth series of X-rays may result in an exposure of up to 6 (digital) to 18 (film) mrem, for a yearly average of up to 40 mrem.[104][105][106][107][108][109][110]\\r\\n\\r\\nFinancial incentives have been shown to have a significant impact on X-ray use with doctors who are paid a separate fee for each X-ray providing more X-rays.[111]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable uses of X-rays include\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile generally considered invisible to the human eye, in special circumstances X-rays can be visible. Brandes, in an experiment a short time after R?ntgen's landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint \\"blue-gray\\" glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.[117] Upon hearing this, R?ntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door R?ntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the experiment was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with ionizing radiation. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of rhodopsin molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of phosphorescence in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough X-rays are otherwise invisible, it is possible to see the ionization of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough. The beamline from the wiggler at the ID11 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility is one example of such high intensity.[118]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe measure of X-rays ionizing ability is called the exposure:\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the effect of ionizing radiation on matter (especially living tissue) is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited into them rather than the charge generated. This measure of energy absorbed is called the absorbed dose:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the absorbed dose.","input":"When were x rays first used in medicine?"},{"output":"Long rifles","context":"This is a list of infantry weapons used in the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Brown Bess Musket muzzle-loading smoothbore musket was one of the most commonly used weapons in the American Revolution. While this was a British weapon, it was used heavily by the American Colonists. This musket was used to fire a single shot ball, or a cluster style shot which fired multiple projectiles giving the weapon a \\"shotgun\\" effect. There were two variations of the Brown Bess: the Short Land Pattern and the Long Land Pattern. The Short Land was shorter, less bulky, less heavy than the Long Land. Most American fighters implemented the Long Land Pattern.[1]\\r\\nLarge numbers of Charleville Model 1763 and 1766 muskets were imported into the United States from France during the American Revolution, due in large part to the influence of Marquis de Lafayette.[6] The Charleville 1766 heavily influenced the design of the Springfield Musket of 1795.\\r\\nMany muskets were produced locally by various gunsmiths in the colonies, often reusing parts from other weapons. These are known as \\"Committee of Safety\\" muskets, as they were funded by the fledgling local government. Because of the need to produce as many weapons as quick as possible, and also out of fear of prosecution by the British government, many of the muskets did not bear a maker's mark. Also, the muskets took a long reloading time so during bayonet charges the Americans were vulnerable to the British. Some were simply marked as property of a state, or \\"US,\\" U:STATES,\\" or \\"UNITED STATES.\\" [2]\\r\\nLong rifles were an American design of the 18th century, produced by individual German gunsmiths in Pennsylvania. Based on the J?ger rifle,[3] long rifles, known as \\"Pennsylvania Rifles\\", were used by snipers and light infantry throughout the Revolutionary War. The grooved barrel increased the range and accuracy by spinning a snugly fitted ball, giving an accurate range of 300 yards compared to 100 yards for smoothbore muskets. Drawbacks included the low rate of fire due to the complicated reloading process, the impossibility to fit it with a bayonet, the high cost, and lack of standardization that required extensive training with a particular rifle for a soldier to realize the weapon's full potential. Due to the drawbacks, George Washington argued for a limited role of rifles in the Colonial military, while Congress was more enthusiastic and authorized the raising of several companies of riflemen.[4] Long rifles played a significant part in the battles of Saratoga and New Orleans, where rifleman units picked off officers to disrupt British command and control, but required support by units armed with smoothbore muskets or by artillery to prevent the riflemen from being overrun.[5]\\r\\nThe bayonet was a crucial weapon because of the limited range and accuracy and long loading time of the muskets. Bayonets were fixed on the ends of the guns and were a fearsome weapon in hand-to-hand combat in which one or both sides charged the other; with the bayonet leading the charge. The triangular shape of the bayonet created a deep, easily infected puncture wound. Continental Army and militia units, both loyalists and patriots, frequently were not equipped with bayonets. Regular British infantrymen however had a bayonet as part of their standard gear, stored in a side pouch.[6]\\r\\nThe Pattern 1776 Rifle was built by William Grice, and was based on German rifles in use by the British Army during its time. About 1,000 of these were built and used by the British Army. The rifle was given to light companies of regiments in the British Army during the American Revolution. The Gun is .62 Calibre with a 30.5 inch barrel [7]\\r\\nThe Ferguson rifle is the first breech-loading rifle to be adopted by the military. It had a much faster fire rate than muskets, and was one of only a very few rifles that could be reloaded while in the prone position. The cost was much higher than any other rifle used by the British military. It had an accurate range of approximately 100 yards with a 3ÿ4 inch inaccuracy. The creator of this rifle, Major Patrick Ferguson, used approximately 100 of them for his rifle corps; however when the Major was mortally wounded the rifle production ended and Ferguson's unit was disbanded. Only two military examples of Ferguson rifles are known to exist today, along with a few civilian models and modern reproductions.[8]\\r\\nThe Brown Bess musket was the gun used by the British military from 1722 until about 1838. It was used throughout the Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars. It was capable of firing approximately three to four shots per minute. The Brown Bess Musket was a flint-lock musket, meaning it would use flint in order to spark the gunpowder loaded into the gun to cause the gun to fire.\\r\\nThe Charleville musket was the primary musket used by French infantry during the American Revolution. Getting its name from the principal French arsenal located in Charleville, France in the Champagne-Ardenne province, this weapon had a general effective range of 50 yards and fired a .69-cal round.[9] A typical Charleville musket is 60.00 inches in length, weighs an average of 10.06lb (loaded), and is capable of firing two rounds per minute.[10][not in citation given] These single-shot-muzzle-loaded muskets contained iron sights and are notorious for being the superior weapon to the British Brown Bess due to its lighter weight and (relatively) higher accuracy.[11]\\r\\nNumerous models of the Charleville musket were utilized in the American Revolution. The French shipped 11,000 muskets to Philadelphia, PA and 37,000 to Portsmouth, New Hampshire; both of these shipments contained model 1760's muskets. The model 1777 was not shipped to American troops, however they were used as the primary armament for General Rochambeau's regiments that departed for America in 1780.[10] Many infantrymen utilized a 15-inch bayonet; according to many reports, bayonets may have accounted for over 1/3 of all kills.[11]\\r\\nA tomahawk, or war club, was the favorite weapon of the Native Americans during the revolutionary war.[12] These traditional hatchets were often made of stone and wood and could be used for a variety of purposes.[12] They were useful in hand-to-hand combat, could be thrown short distances, and were often used as tools.[13] Tomahawks usually consisted of a light wooden handle and a thin square blade.[13] More often than not, they would have one thick spike protruding from one end of the blade. These spikes could be used as tools or weapons. Contrary to popular belief, tomahawks very rarely had any decorative markings. Instead, they were simple and functional.[13]","input":"What weapons did they use in the battle of saratoga?"},{"output":"April 1847","context":"The Mormon pioneers were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Latter-day Saints, who migrated across the United States from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley in what is today the U.S. state of Utah. At the time of the ceasefire and planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory was owned by the Republic of Mexico, which soon after went to war with the United States over the annexation of Texas. Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of this war.\\r\\nThe journey was taken by about 70,000 people beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 assassination of the Mormon leader Joseph Smith made it clear the group could not remain in Nauvoo, Illinoiswhich the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed because of the Missouri Mormon War, setting off the Illinois Mormon War. The well-organized wagon train migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the Mormon Exodus is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so wagon train migrations to the far west continued sporadically until the 20th century.\\r\\nSince its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church were often harshly treated by their neighbors, partially due to their religious beliefs, sometimes as a reaction against the actions and the words of the LDS Church and its members and leaders. These and other reasons caused the body of the Church to move from one place to anotherto Ohio, Missouri, and then to Illinois, where church members built the city of Nauvoo. Sidney Rigdon was the First Counselor in the LDS First Presidency, and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the Salt Sermon and the July 4th Oration.[1] These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Rigdon was released on a writ of habeas corpus and made his way to Illinois, where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844 Joseph Smith, and his brother Hyrum Smith were killed by a mob while in custody in the city of Carthage, Illinois. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint temple in Nauvoo.\\r\\nAccording to church belief, God inspired Brigham Young, Joseph Smith's successor as President of the Church, to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States (into what was then Mexico, though the U.S. Army had already captured New Mexico and California in late 1846). During the winter of 1846-47, Latter-day Saint leaders in Winter Quarters and Iowa laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Brigham Young first met Thomas L. Kane, a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the Polk administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Brigham Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile Federal government. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured Church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the \\"American Moses.\\"\\r\\nBrigham Young personally reviewed all available information on the Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulting with mountain men and trappers who traveled through Winter Quarters, and meeting with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no one else wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.\\r\\nBrigham Young organized a vanguard company to break the trail west to the Rocky Mountains, gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and native tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish fords and ferries and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the Platte River was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the rivers south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, Church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.\\r\\nIn April 1847, Young consulted with members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who had recently returned from the British mission. John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on John C. Fremonts recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three blacks and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible Indian danger, a militia and night guard was formed under the direction of Stephen Markham.\\r\\nOn April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5?km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp's hunters for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed. [2] Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m.. Each day's travel ended at 8:30?p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m.. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the Sabbath.\\r\\nSome camp members were assigned specific tasks. William Clayton was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. After three weeks, Clayton grew tired of personally counting the revolutions of a wagon wheel and computing the day's distance by multiplying the count by the wheel's circumference. After consulting with Orson Pratt, an accomplished mathematician, he designed a mechanism consisting of a set of wooden cog wheels attached to the hub of a wagon wheel, with the mechanism \\"counting\\" or recording by position the revolutions of the wheel. Clayton's design, which he called the roadometer, is the basis for most modern odometers. The apparatus was built to Clayton and Pratt's specifications by the company's carpenter Appleton Milo Harmon and was first used on the morning of May 12, 1847. The roadometer showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. Apostle Orson Pratt was named the company's scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west.\\r\\nWomen of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from Mississippi who merged with the main party at Laramie, Wyoming.\\r\\nThe first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the Mormon Battalion who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in Pueblo, Colorado. Also traveling in the new group were Church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at Ft. Bridger. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the Sweetwater River, the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of Thomas Grover were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.\\r\\nDuring the last week of June, Sam Brannan, leader of the Mormon emigrant ship Brooklyn, met the company near Green River, Wyoming. He reported to Young about his group's successful journey and their settlement in what is today San Francisco, California. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leaders focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.\\r\\nThe vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner-Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. Since crossing the Green River, several members of the party had suffered from a fever, generally accepted as a mountain fever probably induced by wood ticks. Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.\\r\\nIn July 1847 the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: ...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view. The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19?km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.\\r\\nOn July 24, Young first saw the valley from a sick wagon driven by his friend Wilford Woodruff. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared \\"This is the right place, drive on.\\" Today a monument stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.\\r\\nOn July 28, Young established a location for the future Salt Lake Temple and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.[3]\\r\\nEach year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into \\"companies\\", each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.\\r\\nThe pioneers traveled to the Salt Lake Valley in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, handcarts, and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings.[notes 1] Their trail along the north bank of the Platte River and North Platte River and over the continental divide climbing up to South Pass and Pacific Springs from Fort John along the valley of the Sweetwater River and then down to Fort Bridger and thence down to the Great Salt Lake became known as the Mormon Trail.\\r\\nFinancial resources of the Church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in Missouri and Illinois. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than 1,000 miles (2,000?km) to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were under supplied.\\r\\nCovered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as LDS members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the Nauvoo Neighbor printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15?lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the amount of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.[4]\\r\\nSeveral later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to wheelbarrows) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.\\r\\nDue to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was AprilÿSeptember. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.\\r\\nIn November 1845 Samuel Brannan, newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper The Prophet (later the New York Messenger), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship Brooklyn.[5]\\r\\nOn the 4th of February, 1846 (the same day the Mormon Nauvoo exodus began), the ship Brooklyn cleared New York harbor and began its nearly 6-month voyage to the Pacific coast of the then-Mexican Territory of California.[6] The ship weighed 445 short tons (404?t) and measured 125?ft x 28?ft G?14?ft (8.5?m G?4.3?m) x 4.3 m) and was built in 1834 by Joseph H. Russell at Newcastle, Maine.[7]\\r\\nThe voyage is the longest passage made by a Mormon emigrant company. The ship Brooklyn sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around Cape Horn, stopping at the Juan Fernndez Islands, then to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), finally docking in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.\\r\\nAugusta Joyce Crocheron, a passenger on the ship Brooklyn, described the voyage:\\r\\nAs for the pleasure of the trip, we met disappointment, for we once lay becalmed in the tropics, and at another time we were \\"hatched below\\" during a terrific storm. Women and children were at night lashed to their berths, for in no other way could they keep in. Furniture rolled back and forth endangering limb and life. The waves swept the deck and even reached the staterooms... Children's voices were crying in the darkness, mother's voices soothing or scolding, men's voices rising above the others, all mingled with the distressing groans and cries of the sick for help, and, above all, the roaring of the wind and howling of the tempest made a scene and feeling indescribable.[5]\\r\\nThe passengers of the ship Brooklyn left the United States with the hope of finding religious freedom. When they arrived in San Francisco however, they were informed that they were in the United States of America. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers \\"felt more cheerful and secure.\\" Mormon historian B. H. Roberts noted in his work A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:\\r\\nOn the announcement of the United States naval officer, who boarded the Brooklyn as she came to anchor, that the emigrants \\"were in the United States of America,\\" three hearty cheers were given in reply... Three weeks previous to the arrival of the Saints, the United States flag had been raised and the country taken possession of in the name of the government which the flag represented.[6]\\r\\nThis dangerous trek of nearly 24,000 miles (39,000?km) would claim 10 lives of the ship's 238 passengers,[8] nine of whom were buried at sea.\\r\\nAfter the initial departure of the Latter-day Saints living in Illinois and Missouri, converts to the church from other areas in the United States and from Europe followed the initial trail to join the main body of the Church in Salt Lake City. Every year from 1847 until 1869, church members making this journey were formed into organized companies.[9] Migration continued until about 1890, but those who came by railroad are not generally considered to be \\"Mormon pioneers.\\"\\r\\nMormon pioneers emigrated from many countries. Denmark was one of those countries, with a large number of Mormon emigrants coming to Utah between 1850 and 1910.[10] The migration of Danes was initiated when missionaries from the LDS Church, including Erastus Snow, Peter O. Hansen and two others, were sent to Denmark in 1850. Hansen made the first translation of the Book of Mormon from English, by translating it into Danish.[11] Religious freedom was written into the constitution of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1849. Along with the Danish translation of the Book of Mormon, this opened the area to great success in attaining converts. At that time the LDS Church was urging new members to gather to Utah, which led these early converts to make emigration plans.\\r\\nBox Elder, Cache, Salt Lake, Utah, and Sevier counties had large numbers of Danes listed in 19th Century Utah census totals but Sanpete County was the area where the largest number settled.[11]\\r\\nThe Mormons settled in the Salt Lake Valley, which at that time was used as a buffer zone between the Shoshones and the Utes, who were at war.[12] Upon arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons had to develop and cultivate the arid terrain to make it suitable for habitation. They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Brigham Young sent out scouting parties to identify and claim additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the Great Basin where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many familiar communities in those areas.\\r\\nShortly after the first company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, the community of Bountiful was settled to the north. In 1848, settlers moved into lands purchased from trapper Miles Goodyear in present-day Ogden. In 1849, Tooele and Fort Utah in modern-day Provo were founded. The settlement of Provo was particularly troubling to the Utes, since it was at the heart of their territory.[13] Ute chief Wakara suggested the settlers instead move into the Sanpete Valley in central Utah, where the settlers established the community of Manti. Tensions in Fort Utah mounted after Mormons murdered Old Bishop,[14] and Brigham Young ordered an attack on Utes,[15] called the Battle at Fort Utah. This was shortly followed by the Walker War.[13]\\r\\nFillmore, Utah, intended to be the capital of the new territory, was established in 1851. In 1855, missionary efforts aimed at local native cultures led to outposts in Fort Lemhi on Idaho's Salmon River, Las Vegas, Nevada and Elk Mountain in east central of present-day Utah.\\r\\nThe experiences of returning members of the Mormon Battalion were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. Jefferson Hunt, senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day Cedar City. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in St. George, Utah, Las Vegas and San Bernardino, California, as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in northern Mexico.\\r\\nThe Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the State of Utah, known as Pioneer Day. Salt Lake City also has the Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument, where Brigham Young, Eliza R. Snow, and other Mormon pioneers are buried and where a memorial exists dedicated to all who crossed the plains to the Salt Lake Valley. Additionally, the Pioneer (characterized as \\"Pioneer Pete\\") is Lehi High School's mascot. Lehi High School is located in Lehi, Utah County.[16] In some places, Mormons hold an event called \\"Pioneer Trek\\" for people who are ages fourteen to eighteen. In participating in the trek, the youth dress as pioneers and pack a few things to carry in handcarts. They go on a hike for a couple days so they can experience what the pioneers experienced. During this multi-day event, camp organizers sometimes require youth to avoid the use of technology or anything that the pioneers did not have on their journeys, to enhance the experience.\\r\\nThe Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers information from journals, church history records, and other materials to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled across the plains to get to Utah. This covers known and unknown wagon trains from 1847-1868. It contains lists of passengers in companies as well as genealogical information about ancestors. It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the wagon trains that brought them to Utah.[17]","input":"When did the mormon pioneers cross the plains?"},{"output":"Midnight green","context":"Midnight green (sometimes called Eagles green[citation needed]) is a dark shade of green.

The show aired for a total of 147 episodes spanning seven seasons. The series was inspired by the 1975 film Moonrunners, which was also created by Gy Waldron and had many identical or similar character names and concepts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard had an ensemble cast, which also follows the adventures of \\"The Duke Boys\\", cousins Bo Duke (John Schneider) and Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) (including Coy and Vance Duke for most of season 5), who live on a family farm in fictional Hazzard County, Georgia, with their attractive female cousin Daisy (Catherine Bach) and their wise old Uncle Jesse (Denver Pyle). The Duke boys race around in their customized 1969 Dodge Charger stock car, dubbed (The) General Lee, evading crooked and corrupt county commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling and corrupt Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best) along with his deputy(s), and always managing to get caught in the middle of the various escapades and incidents that often occur in the area. Bo and Luke had previously been sentenced to probation for illegal transportation of moonshine; their Uncle Jesse made a plea bargain with the U.S. Government to refrain from distilling moonshine in exchange for Bo and Luke's freedom. As a result, Bo and Luke are on probation and not allowed to carry firearms?ÿ instead, they often use compound bows, sometimes with arrows tipped with dynamite ÿ or to leave Hazzard County unless they get probation permission from their probation officer, Boss Hogg, although the exact details of their probation terms vary from episode to episode. Sometimes it is implied that they would be jailed for merely crossing the county line; on other occasions, it is shown that they may leave Hazzard, as long as they are back within a certain time limit. Several other technicalities of their probation also came into play at various times.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorrupt county commissioner Jefferson Davis (J.D.) \\"Boss\\" Hogg, who either runs or has fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever angry with the Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for always foiling his crooked schemes. He is always looking for ways to get them out of the picture so that his plots have a chance of succeeding. Many episodes revolve around Hogg trying to engage in an illegal scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help. Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and often tries to frame Bo and Luke for various crimes as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions, as he believes they are generally out to get him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe role of Boss Hogg was played by Sorrell Booke, who performed frequently on radio, stage, and film prior to his role in The Dukes of Hazzard. Boss Hogg is one of only two characters to appear in every episode of the TV series, the other being Uncle Jesse Duke. His namesake is Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other main characters of the show include local mechanic Cooter Davenport (Ben Jones), who in early episodes was portrayed as a wild, unshaven rebel, often breaking or treading on the edge of the law, before settling down to become the Duke family's best friend (he is often referred to as an \\"honorary Duke\\") and owns the local garage; and Enos Strate (Sonny Shroyer), an honest but naive young deputy who, despite his friendship with the Dukes (and his crush on Daisy), is reluctantly forced to take part in Hogg and Rosco's crooked schemes. In the third and fourth seasons, when Enos leaves for his own show, he is replaced by Deputy Cletus Hogg (Rick Hurst), Boss's cousin, who is slightly more wily than Enos but still a somewhat reluctant player in Hogg's plots.\\r\\n\\r\\nOwing to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wind up helping Boss Hogg out of trouble, albeit grudgingly. More than once Hogg is targeted by former associates who are either seeking revenge or have double crossed him after a scheme has unraveled in one way or another. Sheriff Coltrane also finds himself targeted in some instances. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually have to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; in other instances, the Dukes join forces with Hogg and Coltrane to tackle bigger threats to Hazzard or one of their respective parties. These instances became more frequent as the show progressed, and later seasons saw a number of stories where the Dukes and Hogg (and Coltrane) temporarily work together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series was developed from the 1975 film Moonrunners. Created by Gy Waldron in collaboration with ex-moonshiner Jerry Rushing, this movie shares many identical and very similar names and concepts with the subsequent TV series. Although itself essentially a comedy, this original movie was much cruder and edgier than the family-friendly TV series that would evolve from it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, Waldron was approached by Warner Bros. with the idea of developing Moonrunners into a television series. Waldron reworked various elements from Moonrunners, and from it was devised what would become The Dukes of Hazzard. Production began in October 1978 with the original intention of only nine episodes being produced as mid-season filler. The first five episodes were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. After completing production on the fifth episode, \\"High Octane\\", the cast and crew broke for Christmas break, expecting to return in several weeks' time to complete the ordered run of episodes. In the meantime, executives at Warner Bros. were impressed by the rough preview cuts of the completed episodes and saw potential in developing the show into a full-running series; part of this plan was to move production from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, primarily to simplify production as well as develop a larger workshop to service the large number of automobiles needed for the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nRushing appeared as shady used car dealer Ace Parker in the third episode produced, \\"Repo Men\\" (the fourth to be broadcast). Rushing believed this to be the start of a recurring role, in return for which he would supply creative ideas from his experiences: many of the Dukes (and thus Moonrunners) characters and situations were derived from Rushing's experiences as a youth, and much of the character of Bo Duke he states to be based on him. However, \\"Repo Men\\" would turn out to be the character's only appearance in the entire show's run, leading to a legal dispute in the following years over the rights to characters and concepts between Rushing and Warner Bros., although he remained on good terms with cast and crew and in recent years has made appearances at several fan conventions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the first (half) season, the family-friendly tone of The Dukes of Hazzard was mostly in place. When the show returned for a second season in Fall 1979 (its first full season), with a few further minor tweaks, the show quickly found its footing as a family-friendly comedy-adventure series. By the third season, starting in Fall 1980, the template was well set in place for that which would be widely associated with the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as its regular car chases, jumps and stunts, The Dukes of Hazzard relied on character familiarity, with each character effectively serving the same role within a typical episode, and with Deputy Cletus replacing Deputy Enos in Seasons 3 and 4, and Coy and Vance Duke temporarily replacing Bo and Luke (due to a salary dispute) for most of Season 5, being the only major cast changes through the show's run (Ben Jones and James Best both left temporarily during the second season due to different disputes with producers, but both returned within a few episodes). Of the characters, only Uncle Jesse and Boss Hogg appeared in all 145 episodes; Daisy appears in all but one, the third season's \\"To Catch a Duke\\". The General Lee also appears in all but one (the early first-season episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\", the fourth to be produced and the third broadcast).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pilot episode was to include a barber modeled after Floyd Lawson on The Andy Griffith Show as a regular character, but was eliminated when the final draft of the pilot's script was written and before the show was cast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen John Schneider auditioned for the role of Bo Duke, he came to the audition in a dilapidated pickup truck, sporting a week-long beard growth, wearing overalls and a white T-shirt with a pack of cigarettes rolled up in a sleeve collar, and carrying a can of beer, trying to look the part.  At the audition, Schneider drank the beer and said he was from Snellville.  The producers bought his \\"Good Ol' Boy\\" act and Schneider was hired on the spot.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout its network television run, The Dukes of Hazzard had a consistent mix of up-and-comers and established stars make guest appearances.\\r\\n\\r\\nNASCAR driver Terry Labonte makes a brief, uncredited appearance as a crewman in the episode Undercover Dukes Part 1. The race cars supplied for both part 1 and part 2 of Undercover Dukes were supplied by Labonte's race owner, Billy Hagan. However, the emblems of the sponsors of the cars (at that time Labonte was sponsored by Budweiser) were covered to avoid paying royalties.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the show's second season, the show's writers began flirting with the idea of incorporating a \\"celebrity speed trap\\" into some of the episodes, as a means to feature top country stars of the day performing their hits. On its first couple of instances, the \\"Speed Trap\\" was featured early in the story, but for most of the cases, it was featured in the last few minutes of an episode, often used when the main story was running too short to fill episode time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"celebrity speed trap\\" feature was essentially similar: Aware that a big-name country star was passing through the area, Boss Hogg would order Rosco to lower the speed limit on a particular road to an unreasonable level (using a reversible sign, with one speed limit on one side and another, far lower, on the back), so that the targeted singer would be in violation of the posted limit. The singer would be required to give a free performance at the Boar's Nest in exchange for having their citations forgiven; the performer would then perform one of their best-known hits or other popular country music standard, while the Dukes, Boss, Rosco, Enos, Cletus, Cooter, and other patrons whooped and hollered in enjoyment of the performance. More often than not, the performer would give a sarcastic parting shot to Boss and Rosco.\\r\\n\\r\\nSingers who were featured in the \\"speed trap\\" segments were:\\r\\n\\r\\nHonorable Mentions: Mickey Gilley, Loretta Lynn\\r\\n\\r\\nGilley's and Lynn's appearances were not solely for the celebrity speed trap. After performing a concert in Hazzard, Gilley was nabbed while leaving and forced to do a second show to nullify his citation. Lynn was kidnapped by criminals wanting to break into the music business. Loretta Lynn was the very first country music guest star on the show in 1979 and had an entire show titled \\"Find Loretta Lynn.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Janie Fricke was the only guest country star who did not perform a song, celebrity speed trap or otherwise. She played an accomplice to a robber in an episode who hid money in the dashboard of the car that was to become the General Lee.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dukes of Hazzard was consistently among the top-rated television series (at one point, ranking second only to Dallas, which immediately followed the show on CBS' Friday night schedule). With that success came huge profits in merchandising, with a wide array of Dukes of Hazzard toys and products being licensed and becoming big sellers. However, over the course of the show's fourth season, series stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider became increasingly concerned about a contract dispute over their salaries and merchandising royalties owed to them over the high sales of Dukes products. Neither were being paid what was owed to them and this became very frustrating to the duo. As a result, in the spring of 1982, as filming was due to begin on the fifth season, Wopat and Schneider did not report to the set in protest over the matter. Catherine Bach also considered walking out due to similar concerns, but Wopat and Schneider convinced her to stay, insisting that if she left then there might not be a show to come back to, and that settling the issue was up to them.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction was pushed back by a few weeks as fairly similar looking replacements were subsequently, hastily hired: Byron Cherry as Coy Duke and Christopher Mayer as Vance Duke. Bo and Luke were said to have gone to race on the NASCAR circuit; how they managed to do this, bearing in mind the terms of their probation, was never explained. Cherry and Mayer were originally contracted at just ten episodes as stand-ins, still with hope that a settlement might be reached with Wopat and Schneider[5] (in total, they made 19 episodes including 1 with Bo and Luke). Some scripts for Coy and Vance were originally written for Bo and Luke but with their names quite literally crossed out and Coy and Vance penned in.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new Dukes  previously-unmentioned nephews of Uncle Jesse, who were said to have left the farm in 1976, before the show had started  were unpopular with the great majority of viewers, and the ratings immediately sank. Much of the criticism was that Coy and Vance were nothing but direct clones of Bo and Luke, with Coy a direct \\"carbon copy\\" replacement for Bo and Vance for Luke, with little variation in character. This was something that even show creator Gy Waldron has said was wrong,[6] and that he insisted, unsuccessfully, that audiences would not accept direct character clones and the two replacements should be taken in a different direction characterwise, but was overridden by producers. Waldron also commented that if Bach too had walked, the show would have most probably been cancelled. It was reported that prior to filming, Cherry and Mayer were given Bo and Luke episodes to watch, to study and learn to emulate them, although Cherry has said in interviews that he doesn't recall this ever happening.\\r\\n\\r\\nHit hard by the significant drop in ratings, Warner Bros. renegotiated with Wopat and Schneider, and eventually a settlement was reached, and the original Duke boys returned to the series in early 1983, four episodes from the conclusion of the fifth season. Initially, part of the press release announcing Wopat and Schneider's return suggested that Cherry and Mayer would remain as part of the cast (though presumably in a reduced role),[7] but it was quickly realized that \\"four Duke boys\\" would not work within the context of the series, and due to the huge unpopularity associated with their time on the show, they were quickly written out of the same episode in which Bo and Luke returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Coy and Vance were never popular with the majority, a few viewers were disappointed by their departure episode, \\"Welcome Back, Bo 'N' Luke\\", which was for the most part a standard episode, with the return of Bo and Luke and the departure of Coy and Vance tacked onto the beginning (Bo and Luke return from their NASCAR tour just as Coy and Vance leave Hazzard to tend to a sick relative). Even a few viewers commented that they were disappointed by this, and that they would have liked to have seen both pairs of Duke boys team up to tackle a particularly dastardly plot by Boss Hogg before Coy and Vance's departure, but as it turned out, Coy and Vance had little dialogue and were gone by the first commercial break, never to be seen again.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the return of Bo and Luke was welcomed by ardent and casual viewers alike, and as a result ratings recovered slightly, the show never completely regained its former popularity. One of Wopat and Schneider's disputes even before they left was what they considered to be increasingly weak and formulaic scripts and episode plots.[9] With Wopat and Schneider's return, the producers agreed to try a wider scope of storylines.[10] However, although it continued for two more seasons, the show never fully returned to its former glory. Many cast members[who?] decried the miniature car effects newly incorporated to depict increasingly absurd General Lee and patrol car stunts (which had previously been performed with real cars by stunt drivers). The miniature car effects were intended as a budget saving measure (to save the cost of repairing or replacing damaged vehicles) and to help compete visually with KITT from the NBC series Knight Rider.[citation needed] In February 1985, The Dukes of Hazzard ended its run after seven seasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe General Lee was based on a 1969 Dodge Charger owned by Bo and Luke (the series used mostly 1969 Chargers in the beginning; later on, they also modified 1968 Chargers to look like 1969s by installing 1969-model taillamps, taillamp panels, and grilles). It was orange with a Confederate battle flag painted on the roof, the words \\"GENERAL LEE\\" over each door, and the number \\"01\\" on each door. In the original five Georgia-filmed episodes, a Confederate flag along with a checkered racing flag in a criss-cross pattern could be seen behind the rear window; this was removed when it was felt that this extra detail did not show up enough on-screen to warrant the already very tight time constraints of preparing and repairing each example of the car. The name refers to the American Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The television show was based on the movie Moonrunners, in turn based on actual moonshine runners who used a 1958 Chrysler named Traveler, after General Lee's horse (with a slight spelling change). Traveler was originally intended to be the name of the Duke boys' stock car too, until producers agreed that General Lee had more punch to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it was built as a race car, the doors were welded shut. Through the history of the show, an estimated 309 Chargers were used; 17 are still known to exist in various states of repair. A replica was owned by John Schneider, known as \\"Bo's General Lee.\\" In 2008, Schneider sold \\"Bo's General Lee\\" at the Barrett-Jackson automobile auction for $230,000. An eBay auction which garnered a bid of $9,900,500 for the car was never finalized, with the purported bidder claiming his account had been hacked.[11]  The underside of the hood has the signatures of the cast from the 1997 TV movie. Schneider has also restored over 20 other General Lees to date.  In 2008, a replica of the General Lee fetched a high bid of $450,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auto auction, indicating the significant interest in the car as a cultural icon.  In 2012, the \\"General Lee 1\\", the first car used in filming the series, was purchased at auction by golfer Bubba Watson for $110,000.  The car had been scrapped after being wrecked during the famous opening jump shoot, and was later discovered in a junk-yard by the president of the North American General Lee fan club.[12]  In 2015, following a wave of sentiment against confederate symbolism in the wake of shootings in Charleston, SC, (relating to photos where the attacker had posed with the Confederate flag), Bubba Watson announced that he would remove the Confederate Flag from the roof of General Lee 1 and repaint it with the US National Flag.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show also used 1968 Chargers (which shared the same sheet metal) by changing the grille and taillight panel to the 1969 style, and removing the round side marker lights. These Chargers performed many record-breaking jumps throughout the show, almost all of them resulting in a completely destroyed car.  The 1970 Chargers were modified by removing the chrome bumper and changing the taillights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke boys added a custom air horn to the General Lee that played the first twelve notes of the song Dixie. The Dixie horn was not originally planned, until a Georgia local hot rod racer drove by and sounded his car's Dixie horn. The producers immediately rushed after him asking where he had bought the horn. Warner Bros. purchased several Chargers for stunts, as they generally destroyed at least one or two cars per episode. By the end of the show's sixth season, the Chargers were becoming harder to find, and more expensive. In addition, the television series Knight Rider began to rival the General Lee's stunts. As such, the producers used 1:8 scale miniatures, filmed by Jack Sessums' crew, or recycled stock jump footage  the latter being a practice that had been in place to an extent since the second season, and had increased as the seasons passed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the 01 and Confederate flag motifs were initially hand painted, but as production sped up, these were replaced with vinyl decals for quick application (and removal), as needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first five episodes of the show that were filmed in Georgia, the cars involved with filming were given to the crew at H&H body shop near the filming location. At this shop, the men worked day and night to prepare the wrecked cars for the next day while still running their body shop during the day. Time was of the essence, and the men that worked at this shop worked hard hours to get the cars prepared for the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third episode \\"Mary Kaye's Baby\\" is the only one in which the General Lee does not appear. Instead, the Dukes drove around in a blue 1975 Plymouth Fury borrowed from Cooter that Luke later destroyed by shooting an arrow at the car, whose trunk had been leaking due to the moonshine stowed in the back.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke boys' CB handle was (jointly) \\"Lost Sheep\\". Originally when the show was conceived, their handle was to be \\"General Lee\\" to match their vehicle, but this was only ever used on-screen on one occasion, in the second episode, \\"Daisy's Song\\", when Cooter calls Bo and Luke over the CB by this handle, although they were actually driving Daisy's Plymouth Roadrunner (see below) at the time. As it became obvious that the \\"General Lee\\" handle would be out of place when the Duke boys were in another vehicle, the \\"Lost Sheep\\" handle was devised (with Uncle Jesse being \\"Shepherd\\" and Daisy being \\"Bo Peep\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1975 AMC Matador[14] was one of many different Hazzard County police cars used on the series, mostly in the first season; they had light bars and working radios. A 1972 Dodge Polara[15] and a 1974 Dodge Monaco[16] were used during the pilot episode \\"One Armed Bandits\\", these were also seen in the show's title sequence. From the second season, the 1977 Dodge Monaco[17] was mostly used. From mid-season four the similar looking 1978 Plymouth Fury[18] was used instead. The Matadors and Furies were former Los Angeles Police Department vehicles, while the Monacos were former California Highway Patrol units.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1974 Plymouth Road Runner[19] (yellow with a black stripe) was Daisy Duke's car in the first five episodes of the first season. For the last episodes of the first season a similarly painted 1971 model with a matching \\"Road Runner\\" stripe was used. In the second season Bo and Luke send it off a cliff in \\"The Runaway.\\" Another identical Plymouth 1971 model car appeared in the background a few more episodes along with the Jeep CJ-7 until it was finally dropped altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\nDixie was the name given to Daisy Duke's white 1980 Jeep CJ-7 \\"Golden Eagle\\" which had a golden eagle emblem on the hood and the name \\"Dixie\\" on the sides. Like other vehicles in the show, there was actually more than one Jeep used throughout the series. Sometimes it would have an automatic transmission, and other times it would be a manual. The design of the roll cage also varied across the seasons. When the Jeep was introduced at the end of the second season's \\"The Runaway\\", it was seen to have doors and a slightly different paint job, but, bar one appearance in the next produced episode, \\"Arrest Jesse Duke\\" (actually broadcast before \\"The Runaway\\", causing a continuity error), thereafter the doors were removed and the paint job was made all-white, with \\"Dixie\\" painted on the sides of the hood. These Jeeps were leased to the producers of the show by American Motors Corporation in exchange for a brief mention in the closing credits of the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nUncle Jesse's truck was a white Ford pickup truck, most commonly a Sixth generation (1973ÿ1977) F100 Styleside.[20] However, in the earliest episodes it had a Flareside bed, and varied between F100 and F250 models throughout the show's run. Bo, Luke and Daisy also drove Jesse's truck on occasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA White 1970 Cadillac De Ville convertible was used as Boss Hogg's car, notably with large bull horns as a hood ornament. In early seasons, Hogg was almost always driven by a chauffeur, who was normally nameless and had little or no dialogue, but identified on occasion as being called \\"Alex\\"; and played by several different uncredited actors, including stuntman Gary Baxley. This chauffeur would often be dressed in a red plaid shirt and deep brown or black Stetson hat, but on occasion would be an older man, sometimes dressed in more typical chauffeur attire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHogg is first seen to drive for himself in the second season opener \\"Days of Shine and Roses\\", where he and Jesse challenge each other to one last moonshine race. From the fourth season onward, except for a couple of brief reappearances of the chauffeur (during the fourth season), Hogg drove himself around in his Cadillac (or occasionally driven by Rosco and, in the series' finale, by Uncle Jesse) and frequently challenged others by invoking his driving expertise from his days as a ridge-runner. Unlike other vehicles in the series, Boss Hogg's Cadillac is typically treated with kid gloves. The car is almost always seen with its convertible top down, with the top only being seen in two episodes, \\"Daisy's Song\\" (the chauffeur was called \\"Eddie\\" in this episode), the second to be produced and broadcast, and briefly in the second-season episode \\"Witness for the Persecution\\", when Cooter is returning it to the Court House after repairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Green and blacked out 1971 Ford Custom 500 sedan named Black Tilly was used by Uncle Jesse to make moonshine runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme song \\"The Good Ol' Boys\\" was written and performed by Waylon Jennings. He was also \\"The Balladeer\\" (as credited), and served as narrator of the show. However, the version released as a single is not the same version that was used in the show's opening credits; the single version has a repeat of the chorus and an instrumental to pad out the length, uses a different instrumental mix that emphasizes the bass, and replaces the last verse with an inside joke about how the TV show producers \\"keep on showing (Jennings's) hands and not (his) face on TV.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1980, the song reached #1 on the American Country chart and peaked at #21 on the Billboard Hot 100.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon before the series ended its original run on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard went into off-network syndication. Although not as widely run as it was back in the 1980s and the years since, reruns of the program do continue to air in various parts of the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, television stations that aired the show in syndication include KCOP Los Angeles, WGN-TV Chicago, KBHK San Francisco, WKBD Detroit, WTAF/WTXF Philadelphia, KTXL Sacramento, WVTV Milwaukee, KMSP MinneapolisÿSaint Paul, among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nNationwide, the show also aired on ABC Family (2000ÿ2001, 2004) and CMT (2005ÿ2007, 2010ÿ2012, 2014ÿ15) and TV Land (2015); TV Land dropped the show in the wake of protests and controversy surrounding the display of the Confederate flag.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nashville Network bought The Dukes of Hazzard from Warner Bros. in 1997 for well over $10 million; not only did it improve the network's ratings, the show was also popular among younger viewers, a demographic TNN had a notorious difficulty in drawing; The Dukes of Hazzard has run either on TNN or sister network CMT ever since.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show ran for seven seasons and a total of 145 episodes. Many of the episodes followed a similar structure \\"out-of-town crooks pull a robbery or commit a crime or scandal, Duke boys blamed, spend the rest of the hour clearing their names, the General Lee flies and the squad cars crash\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two made-for-TV reunion movies that aired on CBS, The Dukes of Hazzard: Reunion! (1997) and The Dukes of Hazzard: Hazzard in Hollywood (2000). Also made were The Dukes of Hazzard in 2005 and a direct-to-video prequel The Dukes of Hazzard: The Beginning in 2007. [36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Home Video has released all seven seasons of The Dukes of Hazzard on DVD in Regions 1 and 2. The two TV-movies that followed the series were released on DVD  in Region 1 on June 10, 2008 and in Region 4 on June 4, 2014.[37] In Region 4, Warner has released only the first six seasons on DVD and the two TV movies. The Complete Series & 2 unrated feature films box set was released on DVD in Region 1 on November 14, 2017.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe TV series was also made available for streaming and download through a variety of services.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2005, Tom Wopat and John Schneider were reunited during \\"Exposed\\", a fifth season episode of the television series Smallville.[41] Wopat guest-starred as Kansas State Senator Jack Jennings, an old friend of Clark Kent's adoptive father Jonathan Kent (portrayed by Schneider). In the episode, Jennings drives a 1968 Dodge Chargerthe same body style as The General Lee.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nLizard Lick Towing featured an episode with its repossession specialists Ronnie Shirley and Bobby Brantley repossess a General Lee replica.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, in the wake of renewed debate about the symbolism of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee.[43] Although this has led to people making their own custom General Lees and selling them. \\r\\n\\r\\nArtifacts from the show are on display in Luray, Virginia, Nashville, Tennessee and in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Cooter's Place in Luray is overseen by Ben \\"Cooter\\" Jones from the series. The Gatlinburg location features a gift shop, Dukes of Hazzard-themed indoor mini golf and go-cart track, with a small display of costumes, collectibles and artifacts from the show. \\r\\n\\r\\nCovington and Conyers, Georgia; where the original five episodes were produced, have been two major tourist attractions for Dukes of Hazzard fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nDixie Outfitters in Branson, Missouri on Highway 76 has the General Lee and Rosco's police car signed by Daisy, Cooter, Cletus and Enos.[citation needed]","input":"When did dukes of hazzard go off air?"},{"output":"mid-way through season one","context":"The Cosby Show is an American television sitcom starring Bill Cosby, which aired for eight seasons on NBC from 1984 until 1992. The show focuses on the Huxtable family, an upper middle-class African-American family living in Brooklyn, New York.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Heathcliff \\"Cliff\\" Huxtable[1] is known for his comical antics, playful admonishments, and relentless teasing humor. He lives in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Cliff had a brother, James Theodore Huxtable, who died of rheumatic fever at the age of 7. In his high school and college years, he was an athlete who wrestled, played football, and ran track. He later served in the Navy before going to medical school. He is an OB/GYN who runs a practice from the office annexed to his home. In the show, most characters outside of family and friends refer to him as \\"Dr. Huxtable\\", and he is well-respected in the community.[2][3][4][5][6]\\r\\nCliff is married to Clair Huxtable. Both Cliff and Clair attended the fictional Hillman College. Together, they have five children: Sondra, Denise, Theodore (Theo), Vanessa, and Rudith (Rudy). Cliff enjoys live jazz, has an extensive collection of albums, and tries to eat junk food whenever he can get away with it.[7]\\r\\nCliff is very eccentric and silly to most people around him, especially his family, however he is very kind-hearted and an extremely dedicated father with a strong sense of humor. Although he and his wife fostered a tight-knit, loving family, a running gag throughout the series is his thwarted attempts to get the grown children to leave the house.[8]\\r\\nVery playful, Cliff enjoys competition, often making bets with Clair over various things, such as the date a certain jazz song was released, or having a \\"Smooth Contest\\" to see which of them looked more elegant for a night on the town, as judged by the children. He also plays a monthly game of pinochle against his father and some friends, which sometimes gets very passionate. Unfortunately, Cliff often finds himself on the losing end of most of his bets and games, as, for example, he has never beaten his father-in-law at chess. However, Cliff eventually broke his losing streak at pinochle against his father and his friend Homer Dobson with the help of Dr. Foster (played by Roscoe Lee Browne), an expert pinochle player who also happened to be his and Clair's literary professor at Hillman College.\\r\\nIn the pilot episode, Cosby's character's full name is Clifford, as shown on a sign on the exterior of the house. His full name was subsequently changed to Heathcliff, even though in one episode Clair called him \\"Heathclifford\\", and he is commonly called \\"Cliff\\" throughout the series.\\r\\nOriginally, Cliff was to have worked as a chauffeur, with most of the humor coming from his interactions with customers. However, the show was changed before airing to have Cliff be a medical doctor, and the humor to come from his interactions with his family.\\r\\nCliff also appears in three episodes of A Different World: the pilot (with Rudy), \\"Rudy and the Snow Queen\\" (also with Rudy) and \\"If Chosen, I May Not Run\\".\\r\\nHe is the only character to appear in every episode.\\r\\nClair Olivia Huxtable (ne Hanks) is the elegantly tough, eloquent, and engaging wife of Cliff, who is known for her relaxed confidence and striking emphasis as shown.[4][1] Aside from her deep and decorated self-expression, Clair can also be playful and silly. She is an intelligent, classy, and successful businesswoman. A great debater, Clair rarely if ever loses an argument on the show, a testament to her career as lawyer. She is also highly skilled in areas of recall about facts and dates, which she uses during discussions and debates: in one episode she is shown quoting a passage and even the page number of a book during an appearance at a television roundtable. Clair is bilingual but is only shown speaking Spanish on a couple of occasions. Several episodes also showcased her singing talent. Despite her elegant brand of toughness and strictness, Clair is a very loving mother and wife. The character is loosely based upon Cosby's wife, Camille Olivia Hanks-Cosby.\\r\\nHer age is directly stated only once during the series, and two separate episodes provide contradictory information on the age difference between herself and Cliff. He celebrates his 50th birthday during season three (\\"Cliff's 50th Birthday\\"), while she celebrates her 46th during season five (\\"Birthday Blues,\\" two years later), indicating that she is six years younger. However, in the season four episode \\"The Locker Room,\\" it is stated that Clair is four years younger.\\r\\nHer character was originally supposed to be a housewife, but when the show finally aired, she became a lawyer. During the series, she becomes a partner in her law firm. As an attorney she helps her family with legal issues, and she successfully represents her eldest daughter, Sondra, in a case over dishonest car repairs. When it came to the Huxtable household, she was in charge, even though she let Cliff think he was in charge (although Cliff was known to lay down the law when he had to). She was the chief disciplinarian of the children, as shown in an episode where Vanessa and her friends sneak off to Baltimore to see a rock concert and Clair delivers a memorable and scathing diatribe to her. Another memorable moment came when the normally composed Clair lost her temper when Sondra announced she wasn't going to law school after paying her tuition to attend Princeton.\\r\\nClair also appears in four episodes of A Different World: \\"Clair's Last Stand\\", \\"Risky Business\\" (with Theo and Vanessa), \\"Forever Hold Your Peace\\" (with Martin and Olivia) and \\"Success, Lies and Videotapes\\".\\r\\nClair Huxtable has been ranked highly in several lists of the top television mothers. She was voted as television's \\"Favorite TV Mom\\" in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company in 2004.[9] In 2009, she was included in the Top 5 Classic TV Moms by Film.com.[10] In May 2012, Clair was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of \\"Mommy Dearest: The TV Moms You Love\\".[11] AOL named her the ninth Most Memorable Female TV Character.[12]\\r\\nSondra Tibideaux (ne Huxtable), the eldest daughter of Cliff and Clair, did not appear on screen until mid-way through season one. She did not exist in the pilot episode (Clair: \\"Why do we have four children?\\" Cliff: \\"Because we did not want five.\\") In her first appearance, she is a sophomore in college, and Cliff notes her to be 20 years old (episode 10), making her birth year 1964. She earned a degree from Princeton University and had intentions of pursuing a career as a lawyer, like her mother. She married her boyfriend, Elvin Tibideaux, in season four, and later gave birth to twinsa boy and a girlnamed after Nelson and Winnie Mandela. More serious, earnest and responsible than the other children, Sondra fits many of the characteristics of the first born from a large family. Though she had her moments of bizarre thinking (e.g. dropping out of law school to open up a wilderness store with Elvin), she'd usually snap out of them relatively quickly. Because of her intelligence level and overachieving nature, she is looked upon by her parents proudly, but also is held to a higher standard than the rest of the children. Sondra appeared sporadically in early seasons of the series due to the character being off at college at the time.\\r\\nSondra was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child (e.g. a college graduate). Whitney Houston was considered for the role of Sondra Huxtable. Sabrina LeBeauf almost missed out on the role because she is only 10 years younger (b. 1958) than Phylicia Rashad (b. 1948).\\r\\nThe character is loosely based upon Cosby's eldest daughter, Erika, who was approximately the same age as Sondra.\\r\\nDenise Kendall (ne Huxtable) is the second daughter of Cliff and Clair Huxtable.[13] At the beginning of the series, she is sixteen years old, putting her year of birth in 1968. She loves fashion and music, but did not want to attend school to pursue either interest. She is noted as being an individual who usually wishes to march to the beat of her own drum, and often learns lessons up front for herself rather than based off the experiences of others. A two-year stint at Hillman College ends with Denise wishing to see what she can accomplish on her own, which leads her to Africa as a photographer's assistant. While there, she meets and marries Navy Lt. Martin Kendall, and also becomes stepmother to Martin's three-year-old daughter Olivia, his child from a previous marriage. Denise eventually decides to become a special education teacher and makes arrangements to attend Medgar Evers College to this effect, but that idea does not work out as Denise eventually leaves New York again when Martin is posted to Singapore on a long-term assignment. It is revealed in the series finale that she is pregnant.\\r\\nDuring the first two seasons, Denise was portrayed as a very popular high-schooler, with many friends, who seemingly had a different boyfriend every episode. Along with her constantly fluctuating love life, were her various hairstyles and choices of clothing, which were occasionally made fun of by Cliff. In later seasons, however, she exhibited a more flighty nature, often expressing ideas that left Cliff and Clair greatly puzzled.\\r\\nIn season three, Denise left home to attend Hillman College, a fictional, historically African-American college, of which her mother, father and grandfather were all alumni. The Cosby Show's producers created a spin-off series, entitled A Different World, which initially dealt with the life of Denise at college. Denise was written out of the series following its inaugural season (which aired concurrently with season four of The Cosby Show), after actress Lisa Bonet became pregnant. Shortly after the start of season five, Denise traveled to Africa for a year, and there she fell in love with and married Martin. In the season six premiere, she returned home, shocking her parents with the news of her surprise marriage to a divorced single father. However, Cliff and Clair accepted the couple when they met Olivia, who immediately won their hearts and was welcomed into the family. She appears regularly during the first three seasons, and is in only four episodes each of seasons four and five (a picture of her can be seen in the opening credits of season four), she appears regularly in season six, but only appears in a handful of episodes during season seven.\\r\\nThe character is loosely based upon Cosby's daughter, Erinn, who was approximately the same age as Denise. Additionally, Denise attended Hillman College, whereas Erinn attended Spelman College, the university that Hillman is believed to be modeled after.\\r\\nTheodore Aloysius \\"Theo\\" Huxtable is the middle child and only son of Cliff and Clair Huxtable, and is athletic and obsessed with impressing girls, and obtaining a sports car or motorcycle. He is fourteen years old when the series begins, making his birth year 1970. In the pilot episode, he is lectured by his father for not applying himself at school (\\"I brought you in this world, and I'll take you out\\"). Also in the early seasons, he was somewhat of a troublemaker, as illustrated through incidents both alluded to and explicitly portrayed in the series, such as letting his best friend's younger sister pierce his ear, resulting in an infected earlobe, but his behavior had improved by the time he left high school.\\r\\nA running theme of the early seasons revolved around Theo's academic struggles, especially in his sophomore-year geometry class, taught by Mrs. Westlake (Sonia Braga). As the seasons progressed, Theo gradually evolved from being an under-achiever to a successful high schooland collegestudent (in interviews, Cosby noted a similar change in his real-life son, Ennis). While Theo was a student at NYU, it was revealed that he suffered from dyslexia, a learning disability that inspired him to work harder, and as a result overcame it. By the final season, Theo was a student teacher, helping other children with dyslexia at a local education center. In the show's final episode, he graduated from NYU with a degree in psychology.\\r\\nIn the pilot, and once more in season one (the episode \\"Bad Dreams\\"), he is referred to by Vanessa as \\"Teddy\\", instead of \\"Theo.\\"\\r\\nTheo has a long-running, but on-and-off relationship with a girl named Justine, who is mentioned many times throughout the series, but appears in only nine episodes. During his high school years, Theo's best friend was Walter Bradley (Carl Anthony Payne II), better known as \\"Cockroach\\", who was more of a scholastic underachiever than Theo. The two of them would occasionally compose rap songs for various school assignments. When Theo got tickets to \\"Dance Mania\\" (a \\"Soul Train\\"-like television dance show), and only one of them was allowed into the studio, Theo let Cockroach have the spot, but did not feel good about it when he saw Cockroach on TV, and as the center of their friends' attention the next day at school. This episode marked the final appearance of the character, and Cockroach was rarely mentioned in subsequent episodes. Theo appears in the series the most out of the Huxtable children.\\r\\nThe character is loosely based upon Cosby's only son Ennis, who was approximately the same age as Theo (and was also dyslexic).\\r\\nTheo also appears in two episodes of A Different World: \\"My Dinner With Theo\\" (with Rudy) and \\"Risky Business\\" (with Clair and Vanessa).\\r\\nVanessa Huxtable is the fourth child and third daughter of Cliff and Clair. In season one, she is eleven years old, making her birth year 1973. As Vanessa grew up, she faced typical teenage problems and heartbreaks, such as wearing make-up before her 15th birthday in violation of her parents' rules and spending a lot of time talking on the phone with her friends. Unlike her older brother, she was an excellent student and seemed to enjoy school; at the beginning of season seven, she went off to college one year early. She became engaged in the final season to Dabnis Brickey, a man in his late twenties. Dabnis was the head of maintenance at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where Vanessa was enrolled. However, Vanessa realized that she was not ready to get married, and they broke off the engagement. They maintained they were \\"just friends\\" by the end of the season.\\r\\nIn the early seasons, Vanessa is usually considered to be nosy, as she usuallysneakilytries to find out what goes on in the Huxtable house, especially when it involves someone (usually Theo) in trouble with their parents. But, in a later episode, the tables are turned, as Theo catches Vanessa's friends smoking cigarettes in her room, although Vanessa herself did not take part, and even tried to dissuade her friends from doing so.\\r\\nShe often fought with her younger sister, Rudy, over typical childish issues. At one point, their fighting caused damage to both their bedrooms and the kitchen ceiling, driving Cliff to declare their rooms off limits because of \\"World War Five\\" and exile them to the basement until repairs were finished. But, on one occasion, Vanessa got into a physical tussle with Denise over a sweater that Vanessa stole from Denise's closet after Denise did not allow her to borrow it.\\r\\nOne of Vanessa's best friends in high school was a girl named Kara (played by Elizabeth Narvaez), who could ramble on about nothing in particular at high speed. Whenever Cliffwho once referred to Kara as \\"Turbo Tongue\\"was on the receiving end of her babbling, he would always reply with a bewildered \\"Thank you.\\" Vanessa appeared sporadically in the final two seasons of the series due to the character being away at college.\\r\\nThe character is loosely based upon Cosby's daughter, Ensa, who was approximately the same age as Vanessa.\\r\\nVanessa also appears in the A Different World episode \\"Risky Business\\" (with Clair and Theo).\\r\\nRudith Lillian \\"Rudy\\" Huxtable is the youngest of the Huxtable children.[15] She is only five years old at the beginning of the series, making her birth year 1979. She comes of age during the course of the show.[16]\\r\\nA number of Rudy's friends appear in episodes as the series progresses. Among the best known are the taciturn Peter Chiara who repeatedly ran out the Huxtables' front door when frightened; and the chauvinist, blues-loving Kenny, whom she nicknames \\"Bud\\", and who always gets advice from his (unseen) older brother about basically everything. This unfortunately gives him the wrong conception about certain things and gets him in trouble, although he seemed to grow out of it as the series reached its end.\\r\\nKeshia Knight Pulliam was nominated for an Emmy for her performance in season two, becoming the youngest nominee ever.[17] One of her fellow nominees that year was Phylicia Rashad. Neither won.\\r\\nThe Huxtable family was originally going to be two boys and two girls. The youngest child, Rudy, was initially supposed to be a boy, but the character was re-written for a girl (Keshia Knight Pulliam) when no boys auditioned. Jaleel White, later known for his role as Steve Urkel on Family Matters, revealed in a 2011 interview with Vanity Fair that he had auditioned for the role of Rudy.[18]\\r\\nThe character is loosely based upon Cosby's youngest daughter, Evin, who was approximately the same age as Rudy.[19]\\r\\nRudy also appears in three episodes of A Different World: the pilot (with Cliff), \\"Rudy and the Snow Queen\\" (also with Cliff) and \\"My Dinner with Theo\\" (with Theo).\\r\\nElvin Tibideaux is Sondra's boyfriend, and later, husband. They met at Princeton, where they both earned degrees. The two constantly bickered during early episodes, until his interactions with the Huxtables, particularly Clair, challenged him to confront his \\"male-chauvinist\\" attitudes.\\r\\nWhen they return from their honeymoon, they shock Cliff and Clair by announcing their intentions to forego medical school and law school, and start a wilderness supply store in Brooklyn. When his children are born, Elvin then announces that he will re-apply to medical school. This decision later convinces Sondra to resume her studies at law school.\\r\\nElvin was a wrestler in high school and for one year at Princeton, but had to quit after injuring his hip. During season three, he helped Theo with some strategy and moves.\\r\\nLt. Martin Kendall is a Navy officer, husband of Denise Huxtable, and father of Olivia. Phillips' role as Martin Kendall came about when Denise unexpectedly married him in Africa, unbeknownst to her parents and family. When the newlyweds arrive back home, Martin learns that Denise's family not only does not know about their marriage, they do not know about him at all, so he wants to introduce himself to the Huxtables now that he has married into their family and to show his intentions of marrying his daughter were honorable. This does not go over smoothly at first, as Clair and Cliff are uneasy with the whirlwind marriage of Martin, however in due time they become accustomed to this blended family. Kendall also had an ex-wife, named Paula (played by Victoria Rowell of The Young and the Restless). In the finale, it is revealed that he and Denise are expecting a baby together.\\r\\nJoseph C. Phillips played Sondra's date in a season two episode, before coming back as a new character, and playing the husband of Denise. Martin appears frequently in the sixth season but is only seen in a handful episodes of the seventh season, Joseph C. Phillips's final season as a regular. Martin makes his final appearance in an episode of season eight, \\"Olivia Comes Out of the Closet.\\"\\r\\nMartin also appears in the Different World episode \\"Forever Hold Your Peace\\" (with Clair and Olivia).\\r\\nOlivia Kendall is Denise Huxtable's precocious stepdaughter, who is three years old when she first appears in the series. Olivia is the only child of Martin and Paula Kendall. After a few years of marriage, her parents divorced, and her mother, Paula, gave Martin full custody, as she felt overwhelmed by marriage and motherhood. Olivia was then raised by her grandparents and father.\\r\\nWhen Olivia was almost four years old, her father Martin married Denise Huxtable, whom he met in Africa. The new family moved in with Denise's parents, Clair and Cliff Huxtable, who are now Olivia's step-grandparents. Martin, as a Naval officer, is required to travel a lot, so for a while, Olivia was unable to spend time with him. During his absences, her stepmother, Denise, raised her. Olivia continued to live with her step-grandparents while her parents were in Singapore during the final season.\\r\\nThe character was named after Bill Cosby's wife, Camille Olivia Hanks-Cosby.\\r\\nOlivia also appears in the Different World episode \\"Forever Hold Your Peace\\" (with Clair and Martin).\\r\\nPam Tucker is Clair Huxtable's distant cousin.[21] The daughter of a single mother, Pam comes to live with the Huxtables after her mother moved to California to take care of Pam's grandmother.[22] Upon moving in, Pam is a high school junioryounger than Vanessa, but older than Rudy. At first, she is not used to the Huxtables' upper-middle-class lifestyle or close-knit family relationships.[23] Eventually, she fits in, and becomes just another one of the Huxtable clan.

There are four public schools in the valley.[13]\\r\\nLocated within the Mojave Desert, Mesquite experiences a desert climate with a large degree of diurnal temperature variation.\\r\\nIn 1987, the Virgin Valley's first newspaper, The Desert Echo, began distribution out of a local home on Riverside Road. The Desert Valley Times emerged by 1995, and The Desert Echo merged with The Desert Valley Times in 1998. Around 2000/2001, St. Georgeÿbased The Spectrum (a Gannett newspaper) bought and distributed The Desert Valley Times.\\r\\nIn 2006, Mesquite Media Group (MMG) was formed. MMG started MesquiteLocalNews.com in early 2006, the community's first daily internet newspaper with current news published daily. In September 2006, MMG started publishing the Mesquite Local News, a weekly print newspaper that is distributed each Thursday. In June 2009, Mesquite Local News was sold to Stephens Media, which owns the Las Vegas Review-Journal as well as numerous other newspapers in Nevada. The Mesquite Local News was later sold to Battle Born Media, LLC in May 2014.\\r\\nMesquite is home to several casinos, including the Virgin River Casino, CasaBlanca, Eureka Casino Hotel, and Stateline Casino and Motel. The Virgin Valley Heritage Museum has exhibits about area pioneers and local history. The museum building, built in 1940, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Mesquite is a stopping point for those traveling along I-15 between Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles.

It was included on their fourth studio album Toto IV, and released as a single on September 30, 1982. It reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on February 5, 1983 (the band's only Billboard number one), and number three on the UK Singles Chart the same month. The song was written and composed by the band members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 2010s, \\"Africa\\" became popular as an Internet meme.[4] In response to this resurgence and the repeated requests of a fan, the band Weezer recorded a cover version in 2018 that peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe initial idea and words for the song came from David Paich. Jeff Porcaro explains the idea behind the song: \\"A white boy is trying to write a song on Africa, but since he's never been there, he can only tell what he's seen on TV or remembers in the past.\\"[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaich said:\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the beginning of the '80s I watched a late night documentary on TV about all the terrible death and suffering of the people in Africa. It both moved and appalled me, and the pictures just wouldn't leave my head. I tried to imagine how I'd feel about if I was there and what I'd do.[7]\\r\\nIn 2015, Paich explained that the song is about a man's love of a continent, Africa, rather than just a personal romance.[8] In 2018, Paich explained the song is about a person flying in to meet a lonely missionary.[9]\\r\\nAs a child, Paich attended a Catholic school. Several of the teachers had done missionary work in Africa, and this became the inspiration behind the line \\"I bless the rains down in Africa.\\"[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nPaich was playing around with a new keyboard and found the brassy sound that became the opening riff. He started humming a melody and by the chorus, the words just came to him.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nMusically, the song took quite some time to assemble, as Paich and Porcaro explain:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn \\"Africa\\" you hear a combination of marimba with GS 1. The kalimba is all done with the GS 1; it's six tracks of GS 1 playing different rhythms. I wrote the song on CS-80, so that plays the main part of the entire tune.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nSo when we were doing \\"Africa\\" I set up a bass drum, snare drum and a hi-hat, and Lenny Castro set up right in front of me with a conga. We looked at each other and just started playing the basic groove. [...] The backbeat is on 3, so it's a half-time feel, and it's 16th notes on the hi-hat. Lenny started playing a conga pattern. We played for five minutes on tape, no click, no nothing. We just played. And I was singing the bass line for 'Africa' in my mind, so we had a relative tempo. Lenny and I went into the booth and listened back to the five minutes of that same boring pattern. We picked out the best two bars that we thought were grooving, and we marked those two bars on tape. [...] Maybe it would have taken two minutes to program that in the Linn, and it took about half an hour to do this. But a Linn machine doesn't feel like that!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPorcaro also acknowledged that he was influenced by the sounds created by fellow Los Angeles session musicians Milt Holland and Emil Richards. He also described the influence of the drummers at the Africa pavilion at the 1964 New York World's Fair and a National Geographic Special.[11][12] \\r\\nI was about 11 when the New York World's Fair took place, and I went to the African pavilion with my family. I saw the real thing ... It was the first time I witnessed somebody playing one beat and not straying from it, like a religious experience, where it gets loud, and everyone goes into a trance.\\r\\nDuring an appearance on the radio station KROQ-FM, Porcaro and Steve Lukather described the song as \\"dumb\\" and \\"an experiment\\" and some of the lyrics as \\"goofy\\" that were just placeholders.[13] The band was more focused on the album's lead single \\"Rosanna\\" instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe music video was directed by Steve Barron.[14] In the video, a researcher in a library (portrayed by band member David Paich) tries to match a scrap of a picture of a shield to the book from which it was torn out. As he continues his search, a librarian (Jenny Douglas-McRae) working at a nearby desk takes occasional notice of him, while natives in the surrounding jungle begin to close in on the library. When the researcher finds a book titled Africa, the native throws a spear (the shield the native carries is the same as the one in the picture), toppling stacks of books. Africa falls open to the page from which the scrap was torn, but a lantern lands on it and sets it on fire, after which the librarian's eyeglasses are shown falling to the floor. The scenes are intercut with shots of a spinning globe and the band performing atop a stack of giant hardcover books, in which Africa is the topmost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis video also features Mike Porcaro on bass, replacing David Hungate, who had already left the band before the video was made. Lenny Castro is also featured in the video on percussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, \\"Africa\\" was listed by music magazine NME in 32nd place on its list of \\"50 Most Explosive Choruses.\\"[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n*sales figures based on certification alone^shipments figures based on certification alonesales+streaming figures based on certification alone\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWeezer covered the song, following a fan-initiated social media campaign; it was released on May 29, 2018.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn December 2017, Twitter user \\"@WeezerAfrica,\\" run by a 14-year-old Cleveland, Ohio resident Mary Klym,[39] tweeted, \\"@RiversCuomo it's about time you bless the rains down in Africa.\\" After much back-and-forth between Mary and Weezer drummer, Patrick Wilson, the band released a cover of \\"Rosanna\\" to \\"troll\\" the meme.[40][41] Weezer released \\"Africa\\" on May 29, 2018.

Its main purpose was to ban foreign and interstate traffic in adulterated or mislabeled food and drug products, and it directed the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect products and refer offenders to prosecutors. It required that active ingredients be placed on the label of a drugs packaging and that drugs could not fall below purity levels established by the United States Pharmacopeia or the National Formulary. The Jungle by Upton Sinclair was an inspirational piece that kept the public's attention on the important issue of unsanitary meat processing plants that later led to food inspection legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was a key piece of Progressive Era legislation, signed by President Theodore Roosevelt on the same day as the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Enforcement of the Pure Food and Drug Act was assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry in the U.S. Department of Agriculture which was renamed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930. The Meat Inspection Act was assigned to what is now known as the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in interstate commerce. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined \\"misbranding\\" and \\"adulteration\\" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards.[1] The law was principally a \\"truth in labeling\\" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.\\r\\nUnder the law, drug labels, for example, had to list any of 10 ingredients that were deemed \\"addictive\\" and/or \\"dangerous\\" on the product label if they were present, and could not list them if they were not present. Alcohol, morphine, opium, and cannabis were all included on the list of these \\"addictive\\" and/or \\"dangerous\\" drugs. The law also established a federal cadre of food and drug inspectors that one Southern opponent of the legislation criticized as \\"a Trojan horse with a bellyful of inspectors and other employees.\\"[2] Penalties under the law were modest, but an under-appreciated provision of the Act proved more powerful than monetary penalties. Goods found in violation of various areas of the law were subject to seizure and destruction at the expense of the manufacturer. That, combined with a legal requirement that all convictions be published as Notices of Judgment, proved to be important tools in the enforcement of the statute and had a deterrent effect upon would-be violators.[3] Deficiencies in this original statute[example needed], which had become noticeable by the 1920s, led to the replacement of the 1906 statute with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which was enacted in 1938 and signed by President Franklin Roosevelt. This act, along with its numerous amendments, remains the statutory basis for federal regulation of all foods, drugs, biological products, cosmetics, medical devices, tobacco, and radiation-emitting devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\\r\\nIt took 27 years to the 1906 statute, during which time the public was made aware of many problems with foods and drugs in the U.S. Muckraking journalists, such as Samuel Hopkins Adams, targeted the patent medicine industry with its high-alcoholic content patent medicines, soothing syrups for infants with opium derivatives, and \\"red clauses\\" in newspaper contracts providing that patent medicine ads (upon which most newspapers of the time were dependent) would be withdrawn if the paper expressed support for food and drug regulatory legislation. The Chief Chemist of the Bureau of Chemistry, Dr. Harvey Washington Wiley, captured the country's attention with his hygienic table studies, which began with a modest Congressional appropriation in 1902. The goal of the table trial was to study the human effects of common preservatives used in foods during a period of rapid changes in the food supply brought about by the need to feed cities and support an industrializing nation increasingly dependent on immigrant labor. Wiley recruited young men to eat all their meals at a common table as he added increased \\"doses\\" of preservatives including borax, benzoate, formaldehyde, sulfites, and salicylates. The table trials captured the nation's fancy and were soon dubbed \\"The Poison Squad\\" by newspapers covering the story. The men soon adopted the motto \\"Only the Brave dare eat the fare\\" and at times the publicity given to the trials became a burden. Though many results of the trial came to be in dispute, there was no doubt that formaldehyde was dangerous and it disappeared quickly as a preservative. Wiley himself felt that he had found adverse effects from large doses of each of the preservatives and the public seemed to agree with Wiley. In many cases, most particularly with ketchup and other condiments, the use of preservatives was often used to disguise insanitary production practices. Although the law itself did not proscribe the use of some of these preservatives, consumers increasingly turned away from many products with known preservatives.\\r\\nThe 1906 statute regulated food and drugs moving in interstate commerce and forbade the manufacture, sale, or transportation of poisonous patent medicines.[4] The Act arose due to public education and exposs from public interest guardians such as Upton Sinclair and Samuel Hopkins Adams, social activist Florence Kelley, researcher Harvey W. Wiley, and President Theodore Roosevelt.\\r\\nThe 1906 Act paved the way for the eventual creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is generally considered to be that agency's founding date, though the agency existed before the law was passed and was not named FDA until later. \\"While the Food and Drug act remains a foundational law of the FDA mission, it's not the law that created the FDA. [Initially,] the Bureau of Chemistry (the precursor to the FDA) regulated food safety. In 1927, the Bureau was reorganized into the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration and the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils. The FDIA was renamed the FDA in 1930.\\"[5]\\r\\nThe law itself was largely replaced by the much more comprehensive Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.\\r\\nThe Pure Food and Drug Act was initially concerned with ensuring products were labeled correctly. Later efforts were made to outlaw certain products that were not safe, followed by efforts to outlaw products which were safe but not effective. For example, there was an attempt to outlaw Coca-Cola in 1909 because of its excessive caffeine content; caffeine had replaced cocaine as the active ingredient in Coca-Cola in 1903.[6] In the case United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, the judge found that Coca-Cola had a right to use caffeine as it saw fit, although Coca-Cola eventually lost when the government appealed to the Supreme Court.[7] It reached a settlement with the United States government to reduce the caffeine amount.\\r\\nIn addition to caffeine, the Pure Food and Drug Act required that drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, heroin, morphine, and cannabis, be accurately labeled with contents and dosage. Previously many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels. Cocaine, heroin, cannabis, and other such drugs continued to be legally available without prescription as long as they were labeled. It is estimated that sale of patent medicines containing opiates decreased by 33% after labeling was mandated.[8] The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 is cited by drug policy reform advocates such as James P. Gray as a successful model for re-legalization of currently prohibited drugs by requiring accurate labels, monitoring of purity and dose, and consumer education.[9]","input":"Who passed the pure food and drug act?"},{"output":"\\"Missy\\"","context":"","input":"What do you call a female time lord?"},{"output":"Iberian Peninsula","context":"PortugalÿSpain relations describes relations between the governments of the Portuguese Republic and the Kingdom of Spain. The two states make up the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula and as such, the relationship between the two is sometimes known as Iberian relations.\\r\\nIn recent years, both countries have enjoyed a much friendlier relationship. The two countries have the European Union, Eurozone, Schengen Area, and NATO in common. Portugal and Spain had been rival sea powers as early as the fourteenth century. Portugal was more naturally-inclined to venture out on sea expeditions than Spain it being closer to the coast. Portugal was in a position to explore the area facing the Atlantic and adjacent to the African coast. In successfully doing so, it discovered that Africa has been the Arab world's major source of gold brought by camel caravans across the Sahara. This prompted Prince Henry to send expeditions farther south along the Africa coast. Bartolomeu Dias and his crew found themselves sailing in the eastern coast of Africa after a South Atlantic gale blew their ships around the southern tip of the African continent. This passage is now known as the Cape of Good Hope. An expedition headed by Vasco da Gama was sent on a diplomatic and trade mission to India. He followed the route of Dias until he reached Malindi (Kenya) in East Africa. Da Gama bombarded the town and took Indian hostages.\\r\\nPortugal was able to establish a commercial post in Cochin, a port southwest of India. In 1509, another Portuguese explorer, Diogo Lopes de Sequeira, successfully reached Malacca, an important trade center in Southeast Asia.\\r\\nSpain came into the scene much later. After completely defeating the last Moorish (Muslim) stronghold in Spain, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabela directed their attention to the search for new territories overseas.\\r\\nThe rivalry between Spain and Portugal raised fears of possible military conflict.\\r\\nSpain was convinced that it had finally reached Asia with the expedition undertaken by Christopher Colombus. Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese navigator, convinced Charles I of Spain to finance an expedition exploring the Pacific Ocean. Magellan was killed in Mactan but his remaining crew was able to continue the voyage and bring the good news of their circumnavigation of the world to the Spanish king and to Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the first nation in Iberian Peninsula, Portugal emerged earlier than Spain and formed as a kingdom on 24 June 1128 after winning the Battle of S?o Mamede in an effort led by Afonso Henriques, who proclaimed himself King of Portugal in 25 July 1139 after defeating the Moors in the Battle of Ourique, all within the Reconquista. Henriques was recognized as such in 1143 by King Alfonso VII of Le܇n and in 1179 by Pope Alexander III.\\r\\nSpain is believed to have begun by the Union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon in 1479, although the unification of Spain and creation of one nation state only took place during the Age of Enlightenment. Until then the word Spain (Hispania) was only a geographic location referring to the Iberian peninsula. It was only in the constitution of 1812 that the name \\"Espa?as\\" (Spains) was adopted for the country along with the use of the title of \\"king of the Spains\\". The constitution of 1876 adopts for the first time the name \\"Spain\\" for the Spanish nation and from then on the kings would use the title of \\"king of Spain\\". Portugal, Castille and Aragon were allies in the Reconquista in which they reconquered land from the Muslim Moors in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal's reconquest was fully achieved by 1249, while Spain finished its reconquest in 1492.\\r\\nHopes to unite all Iberian medieval kingdoms vanished at the death of Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal, Prince of Asturias, Prince of Girona and Prince of Viana, in 1500.\\r\\nPortugal's copy of the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided the New World between Portugal and Castile. During the 15th century, Portugal built increasingly large fleets of ships and began to explore the world beyond Europe, sending explorers to Africa and Asia. Castile followed suit decades later. Following the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the Caribbean in 1492, both states began acquiring territory in the New World. As a result of the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, Portugal acquired its most potentially important colony, Brazil (much of the South American continent), as well as a number of possessions in Africa and Asia, while Castile took the rest of South America and much of the North American continent. This line of demarcation was about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands (already Portuguese) and the islands claimed for Castile by Columbus on his first voyage. Although the Treaty of Tordesillas attempted to clarify their empires, many subsequent treaties were needed to establish the modern boundaries of Brazil, and the 1529 Treaty of Zaragoza was needed to demarcate their Asian possessions.\\r\\nIn 1578, King Sebastian of Portugal died in the Battle of Alccer Quibir against the Moroccans and the Turks. Having no heirs, he was succeeded by his great-uncle Henry of Portugal, who reigned until his death (31 January 1580).\\r\\nHenry also lacked heirs, and his death triggered a succession crisis, where the main claimants to the throne were Philip II of Spain and Anthony, Prior of Crato. Philip was crowned king in 1581, beginning a personal union between the two nations known as the Iberian Union. After a three-year-long war with Anthony and his foreign allies, resistance crumbled and the union was consolidated.\\r\\nThe Iberian Union lasted for almost sixty years until 1640, when the Portuguese Restoration War was initiated against Castile, and Portugal reestablished the Portuguese dynasty under the Bragan?a.\\r\\nDuring the wars of the 18th century, which were often fought by the major powers to maintain the European balance of power, Spain and Portugal usually found themselves on opposite sides. The Portuguese, courtesy of their long-standing alliance, aligned themselves with Great Britain, while Spain, through the Bourbon Family Compact, allied themselves to France. In 1762, during the Seven Years' War, Castile launched an unsuccessful invasion of Portugal.\\r\\nIn 1777, there was a conflict between the two states over the borders of their possessions in South America.\\r\\nIn 1807, the king of Castile and his French allies invaded Portugal, using a route that crossed through Spanish territory. However, the French decided to take over both countries, overthrowing the King of Spain and forcing the Portuguese royal family to escape to the Portuguese colony of Brazil. Spain and Portugal subsequently became allies for the first time in centuries and, allied to a British army under Sir Arthur Wellesley, drove the French back across the border in 1813 after a prolonged, brutal conflict known as the Peninsular War.\\r\\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, both countries came close to war a number of times during the early 19th century. Both lost their American colonies shortly after the end of the Peninsular War, which severely weakened their global power.\\r\\nThe 1930s saw similar right-leaning, authoritarian and nationalist regimes emerge in both countries. In Portugal, Ant܇nio de Oliveira Salazar established his Estado Novo in 1933. In 1936, Francisco Franco launched a rebellion against the Spanish government, and after three years of civil war, his nationalists were triumphant.\\r\\nBoth states remained neutral in World War II, though Spain was more predisposed to Nazi Germany, Portugal also maintained a friendly relationship with Nazi Germany, supplying it with many key resources such as tungsten. Yet in virtue of the 14th century alliance Portugal had with England, it was also supplying Britain with all sorts of produce, and whilst the Germans had to pay immediately, Britain had an open account for most of the war.\\r\\nWorld War II came to a close in 1945, with the Allies victorious, the two states of Portugal and Spain became increasingly isolated with their governments rooted in the old war, as authoritarian dictatorships, rather than the democracy that was being established or re-established throughout the rest of Western Europe.\\r\\nWhile the other European colonial powers, such as France, Britain, and the Netherlands, gave up their colonial empires in the post-war years, both Spain and Portugal clung to their possessions around the globe. Portugal fought a costly colonial war in Africa, and in 1961 saw its territory of Goa invaded by India. Despite their apparent mutual self-interest, there was very little co-operation between Spain and Portugal when it came to defending their empires.\\r\\nIn 1974, the dictatorship of the Estado Novo was brought to an end by a left-wing military coup known as the Carnation Revolution. This left Spain increasingly isolated from the rest of Europe, which lasted until the death of Franco a year later, after which Spain returned to being a constitutional monarchy and embraced parliamentarism. The PREC that had followed the Carnation Revolution in Portugal came to an end in 1976, and Portugal also became a democracy.\\r\\nThe two states gave independence to their former colonies, liberalized their economies, and began the process of applying for membership of the European Economic Community. In 1986, the two states formally entered the Community, which is now known as the European Union, pursuant to the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon.\\r\\nCurrent relations between Spain and Portugal are outstandingly good. They cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking and forest fires (common in the Iberian Peninsula in summers), for example. These close relations are facilitated by similar governments; such as the conservative governments of Jos Mara Aznar and Jos Manuel Dur?o Barroso and the social democratic governments of Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero and Jos S܇crates. S܇crates even claims that he has one of the best personal relations with Zapatero among international political relationships.\\r\\nIn 1998, both countries signed the Albufeira Convention, an agreement on the sharing of trans-boundary rivers such as the Douro, Tagus, and Guadiana. The convention superseded an original agreement on the Douro, signed in 1927, that was expanded in 1964 and 1968 to include tributaries. The Albufeira Convention governs the equitable use of water and environmental concerns.[1]\\r\\nIn 2009, the two countries submitted an unsuccessful joint bid to either host the 2018 or the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\\r\\nThere is an unsettled territorial dispute on the Portugal-Spain border regarding the municipality of Olivenza/Oliven?a and the smaller town and municipality of Tliga, both currently administered as a part of the province of Badajoz, in the Spanish autonomous community of Extremadura. Olivenza/Oliven?a had been under continuous Portuguese sovereignty since prior to 1297 when it was occupied by the Spanish in 1801 and formally ceded by Portugal later that year by the Treaty of Badajoz. Spain claims de jure sovereignty over Olivenza/Oliven?a on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked, despite that Spain also signed the Treaty of Vienna in 1817, restoring Olivenza/Oliven?a to Portugal. Portugal claims de jure sovereignty over Olivenza/Oliven?a on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz was revoked by its own terms (Which stated: The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation) when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807, and foremost, due to the fact that Spain signed the Treaty of Vienna in 1815, which recognizes Olivenza/Oliven?a as Portuguese territory.\\r\\nRecently, Spain has also initiated a diffuse dispute regarding Portugal's Exclusive Economic Zone in the territorial waters of the Savage Islands (a small archipelago north of the Canary Islands), under Portuguese sovereignty. Spain objects on the basis that the Savage Islands do not have a separate continental shelf,[2] according to the article 121[3] of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the same law that Spain refuses to acknowledge when it comes to Gibraltar. The status of the Savage Islands as islands or rocks is thus at the core of the current dispute, mainly due to Spanish aspirations for fishing and mineral exploration. Today the Savage Islands constitute a natural reserve whose inhabitants are a small Portuguese Marine Corps combat detachment,[4] and two wardens of Madeira's Natural Park. Over the years the Portuguese authorities have seized some Spanish fishing boats and crew around the area for illegal fishing and theft of light beacons and navigation buoys.[5]\\r\\nAs of 2017 Spain had approved a nuclear waste warehouse next to the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant (which uses the Tagus river that flows into Portugal for cooling of the reactors), which is near the PortugalÿSpain border, without carrying out any consultations or impact studies.

In 2010, Haim Saban, creator of the series, regained ownership of the franchise after seven years under The Walt Disney Company.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, shortly after naming Hasbro the new master toy licensee, Saban Brands and Hasbro announced that Hasbro would acquire the franchise in a $522?million deal, with the first products from Hasbro becoming available in early 2019.[4][5]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Power Rangers derives most of its footage from the Super Sentai series, it features many hallmarks that distinguish it from other superhero series.  Each series revolves around a team of youths recruited and trained by a mentor to morph into the eponymous Power Rangers, able to utilize special powers and pilot immense assault machines, called Zords, to overcome the periodic antagonists. In the original series Mighty Morphin, the wizard Zordon recruits \\"teenagers with attitude\\" against Rita Repulsa.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen \\"morphed,\\" the rangers become powerful superheroes wearing color-coded skin-tight spandex suits and helmets with opaque visors; identical except in individual rangers' color and helmet design. Morphed Rangers generally possess enhanced strength, durability, agility and combat prowess. Some possess superhuman or psychic abilities such as super-speed, element manipulation, extra-sensory perception or invisibility.[7] In addition, each individual ranger has a unique weapon, as well as common weaponry used for ground fighting.[note 1] When enemies grow to incredible size (as nearly all do), Rangers utilize individual Zords that combine into a larger Megazord.\\r\\n\\r\\nRangers teams operate in teams of five or three, with more Rangers joining the team later. Each team of Rangers, with a few exceptions, obeys a general set of conventions, outlined at the beginning of Mighty Morphin and implied by mentors throughout many of the other series: Power Rangers may not use their Ranger powers for personal gain or for escalating a fight (unless the enemy does so), nor may the Power Rangers disclose their identities to the general public.[note 2] The penalty for disobeying these rules is the loss of their power.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in Super Sentai, the color palette of each Power Rangers team changes every series.[note 3] Only Red and Blue appear in every Ranger team, while a Yellow Ranger has been present in every season except Power Rangers Dino Charge.  Other colors and designations also appear throughout the series.[note 4] A Rangers' color designation also influences their wardrobe throughout the series: civilian clothing often matches Ranger color.[note 5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore creating Power Rangers, the idea of adapting Sentai series to the American public emerged in the late 1970s after the agreement between Toei Company and Marvel Comics to exchange concepts to adapt them to their respective audiences. Toei, together with Marvel, created the Spider Man series, based on the comics of the same name, and produced three Super Sentai series, which had great success in Japan. While Stan Lee and Marvel tried to sell the Sun Vulcan series to various television stations, including HBO, but unlike what happened in Japan, this did not succeed and after three years, the agreement ended.[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral years later, another idea to adapt Super Sentai began in the 80s when Haim Saban made a business trip to Japan, in which, during his stay at the hotel, the only thing that was being transmitted on his television was the Japanese series \\"Super Sentai\\". At that time, Saban was fascinated by the concept of 5 people masked in spandex suits fighting monsters, so in 1985, he produced the pilot episode of Bio-Man, an American adaptation of Choudenshi Bioman, which was rejected by several of the largest American television stations.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction of Power Rangers episodes involves extensive localization of and revision of original Super Sentai source material in order to incorporate American culture and conform to American television standards. Rather than making an English dub or translation of the Japanese footage, Power Rangers programs consist of scenes featuring English-speaking actors spliced with scenes featuring either Japanese actors dubbed into English or the action scenes from the Super Sentai Series featuring the Rangers fighting monsters or the giant robot (Zord and Megazord) battles with English dubbing. In some series, original fight scenes are filmed to incorporate characters or items unique to the Power Rangers production.[12] Like many of Saban Entertainment previous ventures in localizing Japanese television for a Western audience, the plot, character names, and other names usually differ greatly from the source footage, though a few seasons have stayed close to the story of the original Super Sentai season.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with adapting the villains from the Super Sentai counterparts, most Power Rangers series also feature villains with no Sentai counterpart. Generally, the primary antagonist of a Power Rangers series (for example, Lord Zedd, Divatox, etc.) are not adapted from the Sentai. Exceptions to this includes Mighty Morphin, Zeo, Lightspeed Rescue and a few others which only use villains adapted from the Japanese shows.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe series that began the franchise, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers (an American adaptation of the 1992 Japanese Super Sentai Series, Kyry Sentai Zyuranger), began broadcasting as part of the Fox Kids block of programing that aired on the FOX network. It lasted for three seasons (from 1993 to 1996).[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSaban Entertainment distributed the Power Rangers series from 1993 until the end of 2001, and Fox broadcast it until the fall of 2002. The Walt Disney Company purchased the franchise as part of a buyout that took place in 2001.[13][14][15][16] This resulted in Fox Family Worldwide becoming ABC Family Worldwide Inc.[16] This buyout also saw Saban Entertainment becoming BVS Entertainment in 2002, from News Corporation, Fox's parent company, and Haim Saban.[16] The show continued to air on Fox until the company replaced its Fox Kids package with \\"FoxBox\\" in the United States. Since September 2002, all Power Rangers shows had aired on various Disney-owned networks (ABC Kids, Toon Disney and Jetix channels worldwide).[13] When Wild Force ended, Disney moved production of the franchise from Los Angeles to New Zealand. This resulted in the closure of MMPR Productions and the dismissal of many members of the production. From Ninja Storm to date, Power Rangers is produced in New Zealand. ABC Family, another Disney-owned network, also used to air Power Rangers until it did away with its Jetix timeslot after August 31, 2006. On February 12, 2009, Toon Disney ended in the wake of Disney XD, ending cable airings of Power Rangers in certain areas of the United States. Several ABC affiliate broadcasting groups declined to air most of the Power Rangers series since 2006 due to the lack of FCC-compliant educational and informational content in the programs.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saban era seasons, starting with In Space, have gone under the \\"Saban's Power Rangers\\" moniker, up until Time Force. Since the re-acquisition of Power Rangers by Saban in 2010, this practice has continued once again starting with Samurai.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in 2005, up until 2007, during its run on Jetix, Power Rangers reruns were aired under the moniker Power Rangers Generations, showcasing select episodes from Mighty Morphin through Dino Thunder.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article in The New Zealand Herald published on March 7, 2009, identified Power Rangers RPM as the last season of the Power Rangers run. Production manager Sally Campbell stated in an interview, \\"...at this stage we will not be shooting another season.\\"[18][19] A September 1, 2009, revision to Disney A to Z: The Official Encyclopedia by Disney's head archivist Dave Smith states that \\"production of new episodes [of Power Rangers] ceased in 2009\\".[20] Production of Power Rangers ceased and the last[update] series by BVS Entertainment, RPM, ended on December 26, 2009.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn October 1, 2009, Bandai released a press release that Disney would re-broadcast Mighty Morphin Power Rangers starting in January 2010 on ABC Kids in lieu of a new series utilizing footage from the 2009 Super Sentai television series. A new toy line accompanied the series and appeared in stores in the later part of 2009.[13][21][22] ABC's over-the air telecasts ended on August 28, 2010, and turned the hour back to affiliates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn May 12, 2010, Haim Saban bought back the Power Rangers franchise from Disney for $43?million and announced plans to produce a new season of the television series.[23][24][25] The eighteenth season, Samurai, began airing on Nickelodeon on February 7, 2011,[24][26] with the previous episodes beginning rebroadcast on Nicktoons later that year.[26][27][28] It was also announced that Saban plans to make a new Power Rangers movie.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands would launch a Saturday morning cartoon block on The CW, called Vortexx, on August 25, 2012, that would air Power Rangers Lost Galaxy.[30][31][32][33][34] The series was removed before the season even finished, ending up doing so on the Vortexx website. The block itsel ended in fall 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo commemorate the series' 20th anniversary, Nickelodeon began airing Power Rangers Megaforce on February 2, 2013, featuring all of the past rangers from the series' 20-year history in the last episode of the season. On October 1, 2013, Saban Brands announced that it had extended agreements with Nickelodeon and Bandai America Incorporated through 2016 for its globally recognized Power Rangers franchise.[35] The 90s Are All That aired Mighty Morphin Power Rangers as part of Mighty Morphin Weekend in 2013. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2014, Saban Brands and Lionsgate announced that they are planning to produce a new Power Rangers feature film, and would hopefully launch a Power Rangers film franchise.[36] The movie, titled simply Power Rangers, was released on March 24, 2017, with mixed reviews and a failure at the box office, as a result, the future of a cinematographic universe for the franchise is uncertain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016, Saban and Nickelodeon extended their broadcast partnership through 2018.[37] In February 2018, the companies announced that Power Rangers would continue airing on Nickelodeon through 2021.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first six seasons, starting with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and ending with In Space, were direct continuations of the preceding season with evolving storylines and character development. The second season began the annual tradition of the Power Rangers acquiring new Zords to battle enemies when they grow to an incredible size while the core suites from first season were used except for the White Ranger. The fourth season began the annual tradition of the Power Rangers receiving new powers and Zords similar to the Super Sentai series. Beginning with Lost Galaxy, although it had ties with the previous story arc, each Power Rangers series had its own self-contained storylines, independent of previous series. Crossover episodes between different series featuring rangers, villains, and other characters from past seasons also began with Lost Galaxy, with a few exceptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Power Rangers franchise has also generated three theatrical motion pictures. The first two are distributed by 20th Century Fox, and the third film released in 2017 by Lionsgate.\\r\\n\\r\\nPower Rangers has long had success in international markets and continues to air in many countries, with the exception of New Zealand, where the series filming takes place as of  2009[update]. As of 2006, Power Rangers aired at least 65 times a week in more than 40 worldwide markets.[43] Many markets carry or have carried the series on their respective Fox or later Jetix/Disney XD channels or have syndicated the program on regional children's channels or blocks, either dubbed into the local language or broadcast in the original English. Since the 2010 acquisition by Saban Brands, international television distribution rights for Power Rangers have been managed by MarVista Entertainment.[44][45][46]\\r\\n\\r\\nBroadcast in East Asian territories has been treated differently from in other international markets due to the prevalence and familiarity of 'the Super Sentai brand originating in Japan. Power Rangers was briefly banned in Malaysia for supposedly encouraging the use of drugs because it contained the word \\"Morphin'\\" in its title, which could be associated with morphine. The show eventually aired without the offending word.[47] In Japan, many Power Rangers television seasons and movies were dubbed into Japanese for television and video with the voice actors often pulled from past Super Sentai casts, leading to the English-dubbed action sequences being \\"re-dubbed\\" or \\"restored\\" back to Japanese as well. Power Rangers Mystic Force is the latest season to be broadcast in Japan on Toei Channel in January 2014, with the Magiranger cast voicing their counterparts. After broadcast of Power Rangers ended in South Korea with Wild Force, Bandai of Korea started airing dubbed Super Sentai series under the ????? (Power Ranger) brand on JEI TV. Some seasons of Super Sentai broadcast in South Korea have similarly named titles as their American counterparts, such as Power Ranger Dino Thunder[48] for Abaranger in 2007 and Power Ranger S.P.D.[49] in place of Dekaranger.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  October?2009[update], 33 Power Rangers DVD collections have been released in the United States:\\r\\n\\r\\nInternationally, additional DVD releases have occurred (such as Lightspeed Rescue, Time Force and Wild Force in Germany) and as free DVDs attached to the Jetix magazine, published in the UK. Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1, Season 2, and Season 3, Power Rangers Zeo, Power Rangers Turbo, and Power Rangers in Space have been released in Germany as well in both English and German, with Power Rangers Lost Galaxy only in German.[56][57][58][59][60][61][62] Additionally, Ninja Storm, Dino Thunder, S.P.D., Mystic Force, and Operation Overdrive saw complete boxset releases in the UK.[63][64][65][66][67] In France, Mighty Morphin Season 1 and Season 2 have been released in their entirety in 5 episode DVD volumes, and the first 25 episodes of Season 3 were released in May 2008.[68] In Italy, Mighty Morphin, Zeo, Dino Thunder and S.P.D. have appeared in their entirety. Zeo and S.P.D. were made available as commercial DVDs, while Mighty Morphin and Dino Thunder were issued as bi-weekly volumes at newsstands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe iTunes Store previously made Power Rangers episodes available: part of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, all of Power Rangers S.P.D., and the first 26 episodes of Power Rangers Mystic Force. Subsequent seasons and episodes of the program also made their appearances in the iTunes Store, but as of  July?2009[update], Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie is the only Power Rangers film available. In 2012, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Season 1 volumes 1 & 2 were released on iTunes to coincide with the DVD releases.

The mountain had been unofficially named Mount McKinley in 1896 by a gold prospector, and officially by the Federal government of the United States in 1917 to commemorate William McKinley, who was President of the United States from 1897 until his assassination in 1901.\\r\\nThe name Denali is based on the Koyukon name of the mountain, Deenaalee (\\"the high one\\").[1][2] The Koyukon are a people of Alaskan Athabaskans settling in the area north of the mountain.[1][3]\\r\\nAlaska in 1975 requested that the mountain be officially recognized as Denali, as it was still the common name used in the state. Attempts by the Alaskan state government to have Mount McKinley's name changed by the federal government were blocked by members of the congressional delegation from Ohio, the home state of the mountain's presidential namesake. In August 2015, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell announced the name would officially be changed in all federal documents.[4][5] While on an Alaskan visit in the first week of September 2015, President Barack Obama announced the renaming of the mountain.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous indigenous peoples of the area had their own names for this prominent peak. The local Koyukon Athabaskan name for the mountain, the name used by the indigenous Americans with access to the flanks of the mountain (living in the Yukon, Tanana and Kuskokwim basins), is Dinale or Denali /d??n?li/ or /d??n?li/).[7] To the South the Dena'ina people in the Susitna River valley used the name Dghelay Ka'a (\\"the big mountain\\"), anglicized as Doleika or Traleika in Traleika Glacier).[1][8]\\r\\nThe historical first European sighting of Denali took place on May 6, 1794, when George Vancouver was surveying the Knik Arm of the Cook Inlet and mentioned \\"distant stupendous mountains\\" in his journal. However, he uncharacteristically left the mountain unnamed. The mountain is first named on a map by Ferdinand von Wrangel in 1839; the names Tschigmit and Tenada correspond to the locations of Mount Foraker and Denali, respectively. Von Wrangel had been chief administrator of the Russian settlements in North America from 1829ÿ1835.[8]\\r\\nDuring the Russian ownership of Alaska, the common name for the mountain was Bolshaya Gora (񶶒^ , \\"big mountain\\" in Russian).[9] The first English name applied to the peak was Densmore's Mountain or Densmore's Peak, for the gold prospector Frank Densmore, who in 1889 had fervently praised the mountain's majesty; however, the name persevered only locally and informally.[7]\\r\\nThe mountain was first designated \\"Mount McKinley\\" by a New Hampshire-born Seattleite named William Dickey, who led a gold prospectoring dig in the sands of the Susitna River in June 1896. An account written on his return to the contiguous United States appeared in The New York Sun on January 24, 1897, under the title Discoveries in Alaska (1896).[10][11] Dickey wrote, \\"We named our great peak Mount McKinley, after William McKinley of Ohio, who had been nominated for the Presidency, and that fact was the first news we received on our way out of that wonderful wilderness.\\"[10][11] By most accounts, the naming was politically driven; Dickey had met many silver miners who zealously promoted Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan's ideal of a silver standard, inspiring him to retaliate by naming the mountain after a strong proponent of the gold standard.[11]\\r\\nIn a United States Geological Survey (USGS) report in 1900, Josiah Edward Spurr refers to \\"the giant mountain variously known to Americans as Mount Allen, Mount McKinley, or Bulshaia, the latter being a corruption of the Russian adjective meaning big.\\"[12] The 1900 report otherwise calls it Mount McKinley,[13] as does the 1911 USGS report The Mount McKinley Region, Alaska.[14]\\r\\nMcKinley was assassinated early in his second term, shot by Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, and dying of his wounds on September 14. This led to sentiment favoring commemoration of his memory, and the Federal government officially adopted the name Mount McKinley in 1917, when Congress passed and President Woodrow Wilson signed into law \\"An Act to establish the Mount McKinley National Park in the territory of Alaska\\" (Public Act No. 353).[15]\\r\\nThe mountain was always commonly referred to by its Koyukon Athabaskan name Denali, especially by Alaskans, mountaineers, and Alaska Natives. In 1975, the Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain to Denali,[16] and, at Governor Jay Hammond's behest, the Alaska Legislature officially requested that the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN), the federal governmental body responsible for naming geographic features in the United States, change the name of the mountain from \\"Mount McKinley\\" to \\"Mount Denali\\".[17]\\r\\nOhio congressman Ralph Regula (whose district included Canton, where McKinley spent much of his life) opposed action by the U.S. Board and was able to prevent it.[18][19] At first, the Board consideration was delayed by opposition from Secretary of the Interior Rogers Morton, under whose purview the board fell, as he personally did not favor a change of the mountain's name.[17] Later, in 1977, with Secretary Morton no longer at the helm of the Department of the Interior, the Board again prepared to consider the name change, but Regula gathered signatures from every member of the Ohio congressional delegation against renaming Mount McKinley, and no ruling was made.[11][17]\\r\\nOn December 2, 1980, with President Jimmy Carter's signing into law of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), McKinley National Parkwhich had been created on February 26, 1917[11]was incorporated into a larger protected area named Denali National Park and Preserve.[20] Naming the new, larger park Denali, while retaining the name Mount McKinley for the actual mountain was thought to be a compromise by many \\"Mount McKinley\\" partisans.[20][21] However, \\"Denali\\" advocates, including Alaska Congressman Don Young, rejected the position that the 1980 action constituted a real compromise, and instead argued that naming the mountain and park by different names only created confusion.[21][22] While the Board was originally set to make a ruling on December 10, 1980, with the passage of Lands Conservation Act on December 2, they opted to defer their ruling yet again.[17][23]\\r\\nThe following year, Regula used a procedural maneuver to prevent any change to the Mount McKinley name. Under U.S. Board on Geographic Names policy,[24] the Board cannot consider any name-change proposal if congressional legislation relating to that name is pending. Thus Regula began a biennial legislative tradition of either introducing language into Interior Department appropriation bills, or introducing a stand-alone bill that directed that the name of Mount McKinley should not be changed.[17][25] This effectively killed the Denali name-change proposal pending with the Board.[17]\\r\\nIn 2009, the retirement of Regula reinvigorated interest in renaming the mountain. Alaska State Representative Scott Kawasaki sponsored Alaska House Joint Resolution 15, which urges the U.S. Congress to rename the mountain Denali.[26] Despite efforts in Alaska, Ohio Representatives Betty Sutton and Tim Ryan assumed Regula's role as congressional guardians of the Mount McKinley name and introduced H.R. 229 which reads: \\"Notwithstanding any other authority of law, the mountain located 63 degrees 04 minutes 12 seconds north, by 151 degrees 00 minutes 18 seconds west shall continue to be named and referred to for all purposes as Mount McKinley.\\"[27]\\r\\nA January 2015 bill submitted by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski re-proposed renaming North America's highest peak as Denali. In June 2015 testimony to Congress, the National Park Service's associate director stated that the NPS \\"has no objection to adopting the name of Denali for Mt. McKinley\\".[28]\\r\\nOn August 30, 2015, Sally Jewell announced that the mountain would be renamed Denali, under authority of federal law which permits her as Secretary of the Interior to name geographic features if the Board of Geographic Names does not act within a \\"reasonable\\" period of time. In media interviews, Jewell cited the board's failure to act on the state's four-decade-old request, saying \\"I think any of us would think that 40 years is an unreasonable amount of time.\\"[3][4][5][29][30]\\r\\nOhio Republicans were critical of the renaming. John Boehner, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, who is from Ohio, said he was \\"deeply disappointed\\" by the change,[31] while now-retired Regula commented that Obama \\"thinks he is a dictator.\\"[32] Presidential candidate Donald Trump called the name change a \\"great insult to Ohio\\" and vowed to reverse the decision if elected.[33] All thirteen Republican members of Ohio's congressional delegation signed a letter denouncing the \\"troubling\\" action of the Obama administration, complaining that \\"William McKinley's legacy has been tarnished by a political stunt.\\"[34] U.S. Representative Mike Turner of Ohio vowed to fight the change, commenting that \\"I'm certain [Obama] didn't notify President McKinley's descendants, who find this outrageous.\\"[35] However, not all the state's elected Republicans agreed: Ohio Secretary of State Jon A. Husted said \\"I wouldn't want people from Alaska telling me what things in Ohio should be. So I guess we shouldn't tell people from Alaska what they should do in their own state.\\"[34]\\r\\nIn February 2015, in response to the objections from Ohio, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, said: \\"There's a lot of things in Ohio that are already named after McKinley. This is no affront to our former president; this is all about ensuring that respect for the land and respect for the native people of the region is afforded.\\"[36] Ohio native and junior Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said he was \\"gratified\\" that President Obama changed the name.[3] Alaska Governor Bill Walker, an independent, said, \\"Alaska's place names should reflect and respect the rich cultural history of our state, and officially recognizing the name Denali does just that.\\"[36] On August 30, 2015, speaking from Denali's Ruth Glacier, Senator Murkowski said, \\"For centuries, Alaskans have known this majestic mountain as the 'Great One'. Today we are honored to be able to officially recognize the mountain as Denali. I'd like to thank the President for working with us to achieve this significant change to show honor, respect and gratitude to the Athabascan people of Alaska.\\"[36][37]\\r\\nObama used the first week of September 2015 on a \\"climate change-focused\\" visit, which he also used to announce the renaming of the mountain. On September 6, 2015, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin criticized Obama's Alaskan visit and also voiced her opposition to the name change: \\"The name of the national park was changed to Denali some years ago. So I thought that was good enough. We could keep McKinley as the highest peak on the North American continent. We could keep that name McKinley.\\"[6]\\r\\nAfter the 2016 presidential election, President Trump and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke reportedly asked Alaskan senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski if they wanted Trump to reverse the name change. The two senators told Trump they did not want this to happen, and Trump agreed not to reverse the name change.[38]","input":"Who was the mountain mount mckinley officially named for?"},{"output":"June 1993","context":"Horrible Histories is a series of illustrated history books published in the United Kingdom by Scholastic, and part of the Horrible Histories franchise. They are designed to engage children in history by presenting the unusual, gory, or unpleasant aspects in a tongue-in-cheek manner in contrast to the formality of lessons taught in school. The books are written by Terry Deary, Peter Hepplewhite and Neil Tonge and illustrated by Martin Brown, Mike Phillips, Phillip Reeve, and Kate Sheppard.\\r\\nThe first titles in the series, The Terrible Tudors and The Awesome Egyptians, were published in June 1993.[1] As of 2011 with more than 60 titles in the series, the books have sold over 25 million copies in over 30 languages.[2][3] The books have had tie-ins with newspapers such as The Telegraph,[4] as well as audio-book tie-ins distributed with breakfast cereals.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTerry Deary studied at drama college and worked as an actor-teacher at the TIE company in Wales. He then became a theatre director and began to write plays for children. Many of his TIE plays were eventually rewritten and adapted into the Horrible Histories book series.[6] Deary said \\"I was in this small touring company, taking plays for children round Welsh village halls. I did find I had this facility for knocking ideas into scripts\\".[7]\\r\\nAfter a particularly successful tour of a play called The Custard Kid, about a \\"cowardly cowboy\\", Deary decided he wanted to immortalise the production, so turned it into a book and sent it out to publishers. The 24th publisher agreed to publish the book by Deary, who was by now around 30 years old.[7] By the time the idea of Horrible Histories was presented to him by his publisher, Deary had written around 50 children's novels. The Guardian explains, \\"they wanted a 'history joke book' and ÿ when he protested that he knew nothing about history ÿ offered to provide the facts to go with the gags\\".[7] Deary explains the series' inception thus: \\"The publishers originally asked for a joke book with a history theme. They said, 'Put in a few interesting facts to break up the jokes because some of your jokes are very bad.' And when I looked at the facts, I found they were much more interesting than the jokes. So we ended up with a fact book with jokes. We created a new genre\\".[8]\\r\\nThe fifth book in the series, Blitzed Brits, was published in 1995, by chance coinciding with the 50th anniversary of VE day.[9] The book reached no. 1 on the bestseller list. Deary decided that the book only gave the British viewpoint during World War II and in the interests of balance wrote Woeful Second World War which focused on the wartime experiences in France, Poland, Germany, and Russia. This book was published in September 1999, which coincided with the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II.[6]\\r\\nIn 2003, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Horrible Histories book series, Scholastic[10] held a competition to find Horrible Histories' Brainiest Boffin. 500 applicants were invited to answer a series of questions, as well as submitting an original design for a birthday card. The resulting six regional finalists were then invited to London to appear before Deary himself playing the role of quizmaster in a mock-up TV studio complete with Roman Pillars and Egyptian mummies. A glittering party followed.[11]\\r\\nDeary eventually returned to the stage. Mad Millennium was commissioned by director Phil Clark, who was a fellow TIE participant 25 years before. He suggested turning the books into large-scale theatre productions. Deary was happy to return to writing plays.[6]\\r\\nIn 2007, the original series began to be republished with a new look and new content. The new books had altered information on the back cover, an index, and a brighter, redesigned front cover. Around the same time the Horrible Histories live-action TV series aired, many of the books were republished as TV tie-ins. In 2013, many of the books were republished in a \\"20 horrible years\\" theme.[12]\\r\\nBy the early 2010s, Deary decided that the series had naturally come to an end. He said, \\"It has had a good run, it's had a better run than most children's series\\", and added that while his publishers have not officially stopped the series, there was \\"a general feeling\\" it would finish.[13] The Guardian explains, \\"Deary long ago handed over the reins for [his franchise], saying he's more than happy to leave it in the hands of others\\". This includes to companies like the Birmingham Stage Company[14] that puts on stage plays adapted from his books, and CBBC that has broadcast an award-winning live-action adaption of his books since 2009.[7] The Horrible Histories franchise has expanded into video games, toys, magazines, and a game show.\\r\\nfrom Terry Deary, The Guardian 12 August 2003[15]\\r\\nDeary commented in an interview, \\"If I had it my way, I wouldn't have schools at all. They don't educate, they just keep kids off the streets. But my books educate because they prepare kids for life...It's outrageous, why don't we start telling children the truth about history? I hope my books do just that.\\"[16]\\r\\nHorrible Histories are designed to engage and enthuse the reader about a subject while appearing subversive, primarily aiming to entertain with a background educative purpose.[4][17][18] Deary views himself as a kid who wants to share facts with other kids, and as a writer who wishes to \\"entertain first and inform second\\". He does not respect authors who follow either extreme, that is, those who either only inform or only entertain. He believes that \\"readers are more important than writers and their needs have to come first\\" and that if the writer engages the reader, they will retain more knowledge from the work.[6] The series has a skeptical view on the accuracy and validity of history.[17][18] An introduction to one of the books in series states, \\"History can be horrible. Horribly hard to learn. The trouble is it keeps on changing ... In history, a 'fact' is sometimes not a fact at all. Really it's just someone's 'opinion'. And opinions can be different for different people ... Teachers will try to tell you there are 'right' and 'wrong' answers even if there aren't.\\"[4]\\r\\nMany of Deary's books make very serious points, underneath all the jokes and gore. He often comments on whether the modern era is as vile as previous eras, and questions the reader's morals and patriotism. Deary explains, \\"I'd basically concluded [The British Empire] was one of the worst things to happen to the planet. So I deployed the facts that illustrate that\\". The Guardian explains, \\"The last chapter of Ruthless Romans portrays modern-day Zimbabwe and essentially asks, is this any different?\\". The musical stage show Barmy Britain, co-written by Deary, \\"features a finale whose sarcastic references to burger bars, bankers, and internet dating leave its young audience in little doubt that whatever the crazed excesses of our ancestors, future generations will doubtless consider us every bit as loopy\\".\\r\\nDeary is very distrustful of the establishment. He said \\"I was beaten, bullied and abused at school in the name of passing exams. It taught me nothing and I had to break out. So I started challenging authority at school, really, and just kind of never stopped\\". He didn't reply to Tony Blair's invitation to come to No 10, telling The Guardian, \\"The only politician ever to have entered parliament with honorable intentions, was Guy Fawkes\\". He also declined an invitation to meet the Queen, and said he was \\"deeply disappointed\\" that the BBC's diamond jubilee coverage included a Horrible Histories sketch live from Tower Bridge.[7]\\r\\nfrom Terry Deary, The Guardian 14 July 2012[7]\\r\\nDeary uses researchers for all Horrible Histories often in specialized fields, such as a military history. While researching his books, he immerses himself in the period so he is in the right context, compiling much more information than he needs. He tends to exclude all the 'boring facts' such as dates, because, he maintains \\"dates don't matter. Human experience matters\\".[6] He wishes to avoid 'preaching' the value of history, instead focusing on the wonders of human nature and asking how we each would behave in other people's shoes.[6][19]\\r\\nDeary uses many generic literary conventions to make his books more accessible to his readers. He deliberately writes in prose styles that follow natural speech cadences. He also frequently uses alliteration and assonance. Deary considered poetry to be \\"another weapon in the writer's armory\\" rather than a specialized form that may only be used in specific circumstances. He maintains that the impersonal language used in textbooks alienates the reader. He, therefore, uses the second person to talk directly to the reader, as if he were talking to them in real life. He views Horrible Histories as one of the few non-fiction or fiction series which utilize this \\"underused style of writing\\".[6]\\r\\nfrom Terry Deary quoted in Creating Writers: A Creative Writing Manual for Schools\\r\\nDeary uses the newspaper style to make the serious material more accessible so that the reader approaches the piece in \\"a more relaxed frame of mind than they would a school text\\", as in an article about the Massacre at Lidice. Newspapers are also used to illustrate light-hearted stories, such as might appear in a tabloid. Newspaper extracts, along with letters and diaries are used to tell stories from the perspectives of individual people, in order \\"to get away from the objective, and to get [his] readers to view history subjectively\\".[6]\\r\\nWhen writing about events and historical periods that are still in living memory, such as the Second World War, the series aims to maintain sensitivity. Deary argues that a story about a Tudor executioner who needs ten hacks to chop off someone's head, for example, can, however, afford to be comical as contemporary society is so far removed from the event. Deary believes that it is important for children to know about recent events, such as The Holocaust, not relegating them as taboo subjects that cannot be discussed.[6] When informed by a Jewish mother that her Rabbi told her not to introduce her children to the Holocaust before 13 years old, and that her 6-year-old had read it in Horrible Histories, Deary replied: \\"Sorry, but what am I supposed to do ÿ lie to children?\\".[7] He has commented that the books do have borders they won't cross. They wouldn't, for example, describe violence against babies, such as the Vikings inflicted, and aside from some snogging, the series doesn't venture into the realms of sex.[3]\\r\\nThe majority of the series' demographic are 'reluctant readers', who like books they can \\"pick one up, read a small section, and then put it down again\\". Deary attributes this to the use of short chapters, the fact that one may read the book in a non-linear order, and the varying uses of media in each book, such as quizzes and comic strips.[6]\\r\\nOften the protagonists of one book can become the antagonists in another book. For example, the Romans are the attackers in Cut-Throat Celts, but their own history is explored in Rotten Romans and Ruthless Romans. Similarly, Vicious Vikings and Stormin' Normans paint their respective civilizations in a more favorable light than in Smashin' Saxons, and the Christians depicted as courageous victims of persecution in Ruthless Romans become the hateful persecutors of native populations in Barmy British Empire and Incredible Incas.\\r\\nThere are 23 books in the original Horrible Histories book series. The first titles in the series, The Terrible Tudors and The Awesome Egyptians, were published in 1993 and 1994. The Horrible Histories series also includes two-in-one books, a box set, special books, handbooks, city guides, comic-strips, annuals, novelty books, and more.\\r\\nDeary announced that the series would officially come to an end in 2013. The Telegraph said, \\"After Deary was reported to have given up the bestselling series because he had run out of tales to tell.....his publisher would not risk putting out any new ones.\\" Deary says he cannot write a new book unless commissioned. He has not been told to stop writing but neither has he explicitly been asked to continue, citing as a probable cause the gamble involved in publishing a new book. He believes that \\"...when you've got 60 titles there that you can rework and freshen up for the new audiences that are growing up all the time writing new books can be seen as unacceptably risky in the current publishing climate.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe books have been issued since 1997 by the publishing house Egmont. In Poland, the series' common name, Strrraszna historia, includes Strrraszna historia (Horrible Histories), Strrraszne s?awy (Horribly Famous), and S?awy z krypty (Dead Famous). There is also a sub-series describing various aspects of Polish history and society (written by Ma?gorzata Fabianowska and Ma?gorzata Nesteruk, illustrated by J?drzej ?aniecki). These titles were written and published exclusively in Poland and have not yet been published in English.\\r\\nThe collection Os Horrveis (The Horribles) in Portugal and Saber Horrvel (Horrible knowledge) in Brazil are designed to create interest in history, geography, science and other school subjects. The collection has become a great commercial success. In Brazil, \\"Saber Horrvel\\" is published by Editora Melhoramentos and has sold more than 1 million copies.[citation needed] In Portugal, the collection Os Horrveis is published by Publica??es Europa-Amrica and is subdivided into Hist܇ria Horrvel (Horrible History), Cincia Horrvel (Horrible Science), Geografia Horrvel (Horrible Geography) and Cultura Horrvel (Horrible Culture).\\r\\nThe Czech version is known as Dsiv djiny (Horrible History). As well as translating the English books, it also includes translations of the Polish sub-series. Other books are specific to Czech History, such as Dsn ?esk djiny (Horrible Czech History). They are mainly written by Roman Ferstl, however, Martin Pitro wrote Pyskat Habsburkov. The first Horrible Histories videogame was published in Germany, translating the series' titled Schauderhafte Geschichten.\\r\\nThe Dutch series Waanzinnig om te weten (Amazing to know) is a translation and an adaptation of the English series Horrible Histories, Horrible Science, Horrible Geography and Murderous Maths, but not all books from all series have been translated into Dutch. As of January 2009, this series includes 36 books.\\r\\nOther languages which the series has been translated into include Thai and Spanish. Cut-Throat Celts is known as Y Celtiaid Cythryblus in the Welsh edition.\\r\\nHorrible Histories has received much praise and been generally well received.[21][22][23][24][25] It is cited as a non-fiction series which has successfully used a formula to entice young children into reading: \\"The information here is densely packed, at a suitable level for Key Stages 2 and 3, historically accurate and complete with cautions about history being interpretive, but the success lies in the humorous and varied way that the subjects are presented\\".[26] In Words, words, words, Janet Allen notes the books are \\"delightful combinations or cartoons, graphs and charts, narration, letters and wanted posters that convey a vast amount of information about those periods\\".[27] Other critics also praise the wide variety of media in the books, such as recipes, quizzes and newspaper extracts; use of comic strip is particularly noted.[4][17][28][29][30][31] The series is also recognised as an effective trigger for debates in English lessons.[32] The Daily Telegraph wrote \\"Terry Deary is the most influential historian in Britain today.\\"[33]\\r\\nThe humour of the books has been identified as a major aspect of the series' success[34][35] along with the story-telling skill. The series is notable for being historical non-fiction that young people read for pleasure, the first of its kind, pioneering a genre.[6][36][37] Consuming history by Jerome De Groot, cites Horrible Histories as a series which demonstrates the \\"flexibility and dynamism of the 'historical' form\\" in children's books, another possible market for those types of books. It explains that the books \\"play on children's fascination with goriness\\" and that they are \\"mischievous, irreverent and iconoclastic, appealing to a child audience's desire for silly jokes, presenting history as something tactile and simple\\". Interactivity is attributed to the re-printable recipes and \\"what would you do?\\" multiple choice sections. Groot compares the use of illustration to Glenn Thompson's For Beginners comic books of the mid-1980s.[4] Horrible Histories are noted for making \\"heavy use of visual and verbal textual interplay\\".[38] While the series' direct address to its child audience makes the series a popular choice for independent reading, it can make the books ineffective as read-aloud books due to their personalized style of writing and the visual aspects of the books. However, some teachers have reported using these books in a read-aloud manner.[17] Consuming history by Jerome De Groot suggests that \\"the series' wider popularity is due to their tone and style rather than their content\\".[39]\\r\\nWhile discussing the graphic violence in games such as Counter-Strike, Grand Theft Auto and Half Life, the author Judy Arnall notes that children in many societies, current and historical, often witness events much more horrific than those featured in the games. She cites The Wicked History of the World as giving a good context for this.[40]\\r\\nThe book Bloody Scotland drew the ire of the Scottish Separatist Group, who claimed it promoted a \\"UK centric, anti-Scottish viewpoint of Scottish history\\". They pointed to a featured haggis recipe: \\"cook the haggis until it looks like a hedgehog after the fifteenth lorry has run over it\\". They reported the book to the Commission for Racial Equality, who rejected their claim.[41] The National Trust was unhappy with Cruel Kings and Mean Queens because it made fun of Prince Charles, the trust's patron, and Queen Elizabeth II.[41][42] Slimy Stuarts has been accused of anti-Catholic views.[43]\\r\\nIn the series, there are two books entitled The Horrible History of the World and The Wicked History of the World; however, they are the same book with different headings. To confuse things further, compact and mini editions were planned for release at the end of 2007. The same incident occurred with The Horribly Huge Quiz Book/ Massive Millennium Quiz Book, and The Mad Millennium /Mad Millennium Play. Also, there were two different covers for Horrible Christmas, as well as new paperback, compact and mini editions.\\r\\nMuch of what are proclaimed as 'facts' are, debatably, exciting myths and legends. The books, for example, claim that Shakespeare invented the evil actions he attributed to Richard III and present Caligula as being insane. Some of these falsities are listed in the song \\"It's Not True\\" in the CBBC TV series. Promoting Reading for Pleasure in the Primary School argues that the series provides an extensive level of detail for the subject material, and uses strong, authentic sources.[17]\\r\\nThe series has been described as a \\"popular iconoclasm, a challenge to standard narratives\\".[17] However other critics suggest that this is a \\"deliberate attempt to provide alternate readings\\" on principle.[39] Teachers' omniscient authority is undermined in sections such as 'Test Your Teacher', which says \\"Your teachers will tell you all about the legions and what they wore and how they lived. But they don't know everything.\\" By these tokens, the series could be taken to suggest that formal education provides an approved, abridged version of history, one which leaves out all the gory, interesting bits.[4] Thus certain authors argue that any histories that do not focus on spectacular events are now deemed boring to younger readers.[44] The use of non-linear structure has raised the concern that the books are encouraging shorter concentration spans, that longer narratives develop.[45]","input":"When was the first horrible histories book published?"},{"output":"challenge to British authority","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salt March, also known as the Dandi March and the Dandi Satyagraha, was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience in colonial India led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to produce salt from the seawater in the coastal village of Dandi (now in Gujarat), as was the practice of the local populace until British officials introduced taxation on salt production, deemed their sea-salt reclamation activities illegal, and then repeatedly used force to stop it.  The 26-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a direct action campaign of tax resistance and nonviolent protest against the British salt monopoly. It gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the Indian independence movement and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement. Mahatma Gandhi started this march with 78 of his trusted volunteers. The march was over 240 miles. They walked for 24 days 10 miles a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the Non-cooperation movement of 1920ÿ22, and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi led the Dandi March from his base, Sabarmati Ashram, 240 miles (384 km) to the coastal village of dandi, which was at a small town called Navsari (now in the state of Gujarat) to produce salt without paying the tax, growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30 am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the British Raj salt laws by millions of Indians.[2] The campaign had a significant effect on changing world and British attitudes towards Indian sovereignty and self-rule [3][4] and caused large numbers of Indians to join the fight for the first time.\\r\\nAfter making salt at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4ÿ5 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing Dharasana Satyagraha drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The satyagraha against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with Viceroy Lord Irwin at the Second Round Table Conference.[5] Over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha.[6] However, it failed to result in major concessions from the British.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi's principles of non-violent protest called satyagraha, which he loosely translated as \\"truth-force\\".\\"[8] Literally, it is formed from the Sanskrit words satya, \\"truth\\", and agraha, \\"insistence\\".  In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice.[9] The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and others during the Civil Rights Movement for civil rights for African Americans and other minority groups in the 1960s.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt midnight on 31 December 1929, the Indian National Congress raised the tricolour flag of India on the banks of the Ravi at Lahore. The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, publicly issued the Declaration of sovereignty and self-rule, or Purna Swaraj, on 26 January 1930.[11] (Literally in Sanskrit, purna, \\"complete,\\" swa, \\"self,\\" raj, \\"rule,\\" so therefore \\"complete self-rule\\".) The declaration included the readiness to withhold taxes, and the statement:\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.[12]\\r\\nThe Congress Working Committee gave Gandhi the responsibility for organising the first act of civil disobedience, with Congress itself ready to take charge after Gandhi's expected arrest.[13] Gandhi's plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the British salt tax. The 1882 Salt Act gave the British a monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt, limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax.[14] Violation of the Salt Act was a criminal offence. Even though salt was freely available to those living on the coast (by evaporation of sea water), Indians were forced to buy it from the colonial government.\\r\\n\\r\\nInitially, Gandhi's choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress,[15] Jawaharlal Nehru and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; Sardar Patel suggested a land revenue boycott instead.[16][17] The Statesman, a prominent newspaper, wrote about the choice: \\"It is difficult not to laugh, and we imagine that will be the mood of most thinking Indians.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British establishment too was not disturbed by these plans of resistance against the salt tax. The Viceroy himself, Lord Irwin, did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, \\"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights.[19] The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.[20]\\r\\nExplaining his choice, Gandhi said, \\"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\\" In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari, understood Gandhi's viewpoint. In a public meeting at Tuticorin, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\nSuppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes...Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point  not that; that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.[17]\\r\\nGandhi felt that this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every Indian. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the protest gathered steam, the leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \\"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi had a long-standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, which he termed satyagraha, as the basis for achieving Indian sovereignty and self-rule .[21][22] Referring to the relationship between satyagraha and Purna Swaraj, Gandhi saw \\"an inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree.\\"[23] He wrote, \\"If the means employed are impure, the change will not be in the direction of progress but very likely in the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.\\"[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nSatyagraha is a synthesis of the Sanskrit words Satya (truth) and Agraha (insistence on). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere \\"passive resistance\\" and became strength in practising nonviolent methods. In his words:\\r\\n\\r\\nTruth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase \\"passive resistance\\", in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word \\"satyagraha\\"....[25]\\r\\nHis first significant attempt in India at leading mass satyagraha was the non-cooperation movement from 1920ÿ1922. Even though it succeeded in raising millions of Indians in protest against the British created Rowlatt Acts, violence broke out at Chauri Chaura, where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen. Gandhi suspended the protest, against the opposition of other Congress members. He decided that Indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance.[26] The Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928 was much more successful. It succeeded in paralysing the British government and winning significant concessions. More importantly, due to extensive press coverage, it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size.[27] Gandhi later claimed that success at Bardoli confirmed his belief in Satyagraha and Swaraj: \\"It is only gradually that we shall come to know the importance of the victory gained at Bardoli...Bardoli has shown the way and cleared it. Swaraj lies on that route, and that alone is the cure...\\"[28]  Gandhi recruited heavily from the Bardoli Satyagraha participants for the Dandi march, which passed through many of the same villages that took part in the Bardoli protests.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 5 February, newspapers reported that Gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying the salt laws. The salt satyagraha would begin on 12 March and end in Dandi with Gandhi breaking the Salt Act on 6 April.[30] Gandhi chose 6 April to launch the mass breaking of the salt laws for a symbolic reasonit was the first day of \\"National Week\\", begun in 1919 when Gandhi conceived of the national hartal (strike) against the Rowlatt Act.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi prepared the worldwide media for the march by issuing regular statements from Sabarmati, at his regular prayer meetings and through direct contact with the press. Expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest, and his increasingly dramatic language as the hour approached: \\"We are entering upon a life and death struggle, a holy war; we are performing an all-embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as oblation.\\"[32] Correspondents from dozens of Indian, European, and American newspapers, along with film companies, responded to the drama and began covering the event.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the march itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, but from the residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline.[34] The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based on the needs of the local residents.[35] Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 March 1930 Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, offering to stop the march if Irwin met eleven demands, including reduction of land revenue assessments, cutting military spending, imposing a tariff on foreign cloth, and abolishing the salt tax.[13][37] His strongest appeal to Irwin regarded the salt tax:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the Salt Laws. I regard this tax to be the most iniquitous of all from the poor man's standpoint. As the sovereignty and self-rule movement is essentially for the poorest in the land, the beginning will be made with this evil.[38]\\r\\nAs mentioned earlier, the Viceroy held any prospect of a 'salt protest' in disdain. After he ignored the letter and refused to meet with Gandhi, the march was set in motion.[39] Gandhi remarked, \\"On bended knees I asked for bread and I have received stone instead.\\"[40] The eve of the march brought thousands of Indians to Sabarmati to hear Gandhi speak at the regular evening prayer. An American academic writing for The Nation reported that \\"60,000 persons gathered on the bank of the river to hear Gandhi's call to arms. This call to arms was perhaps the most remarkable call to war that has ever been made.\\"[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 12 March 1930, Gandhi and 80 satyagrahis, many of whom were from scheduled castes, set out on foot for the coastal village of Dandi, Gujarat, over 390 kilometres (240?mi) from their starting point at Sabarmati Ashram.[30] The Salt March was also called the White Flowing River because all the people were joining the procession wearing white khadi.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to The Statesman, the official government newspaper which usually played down the size of crowds at Gandhi's functions, 100,000 people crowded the road that separated Sabarmati from Ahmadabad.[42][43] The first day's march of 21 kilometres (13?mi) ended in the village of Aslali, where Gandhi spoke to a crowd of about 4,000.[44] At Aslali, and the other villages that the march passed through, volunteers collected donations, registered new satyagrahis, and received resignations from village officials who chose to end co-operation with British rule.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs they entered each village, crowds greeted the marchers, beating drums and cymbals. Gandhi gave speeches attacking the salt tax as inhuman, and the salt satyagraha as a \\"poor man's struggle\\". Each night they slept in the open. The only thing that was asked of the villagers was food and water to wash with. Gandhi felt that this would bring the poor into the struggle for sovereignty and self-rule, necessary for eventual victory.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of satyagrahis and leaders like Sarojini Naidu joined him. Every day, more and more people joined the march, until the procession of marchers became at least two miles long.[47] To keep up their spirits, the marchers used to sing the Hindu bhajan Raghupati Raghava Raja Ram while walking.[48] At Surat, they were greeted by 30,000 people. When they reached the railhead at Dandi, more than 50,000 were gathered. Gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along the way. Foreign journalists and three Bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned Gandhi into a household name in Europe and America (at the end of 1930, Time magazine made him \\"Man of the Year\\").[46] The New York Times wrote almost daily about the Salt March, including two front-page articles on 6 and 7 April.[49] Near the end of the march, Gandhi declared, \\"I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might.\\"[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon arriving at the seashore on 5 April, Gandhi was interviewed by an Associated Press reporter. He stated:\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot withhold my compliments from the government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It remains to be seen whether the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.[51][52]\\r\\nThe following morning, after a prayer, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, \\"With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.\\"[20]  He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, \\"wherever it is convenient\\" and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\n79 Marchers accompanied Gandhi on his march. Most of them were between the ages of 20 and 30. These men hailed from  almost all parts of the country. The march gathered more people as it gained momentum, but the following list of names were the first 79 marchers who were with Gandhi from the beginning of the Dandi March until the end. Most of them simply dispersed after the march was over.[54][55]\\r\\n\\r\\nA memorial has been created inside the campus of IIT Bombay honouring these Satyagrahis.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nMass civil disobedience spread throughout India as millions broke the salt laws by making salt or buying illegal salt.[20] Salt was sold illegally all over the coast of India. A pinch of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 rupees (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha.[57] British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax.[58] The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were outbreaks of violence in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Karachi, and Gujarat. Unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during the Non-co-operation movement, this time Gandhi was \\"unmoved\\". Appealing for violence to end, at the same time Gandhi honoured those killed in Chittagong and congratulated their parents \\"for the finished sacrifices of their sons.... A warrior's death is never a matter for sorrow.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Peshawar, satyagraha was led by a Muslim Pashto disciple of Gandhi, Ghaffar Khan, who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called Khudai Khidmatgar.[61] On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's Kissa Khani (Storytellers) Bazaar. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200ÿ250.[62] The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them.[63] One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garwali and troops of the renowned Royal Garhwal Rifles, refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties, including life imprisonment.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Gandhi marched along India's west coast, his close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become sovereign India's first Governor-General, organized the  Vedaranyam salt march in parallel on the east coast. His group started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to the coastal village of Vedaranyam. After making illegal salt there, he too was arrested by the British.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe civil disobedience in 1930 marked the first time women became mass participants in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha.[64] Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. It was clear that though only men were allowed within the march, that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve the salt laws.[65] Usha Mehta, an early Gandhian activist, remarked that \\"Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout at the top of their voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'\\"[66] The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a \\"new and serious feature\\" according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated \\"thousands of them emerged....from the seclusion of their homes...in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant.\\"[67] Though women did become involved in the march, it was clear that Gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within the movement, but created the beginning of a push for women to be more involved in the future.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Sarojini Naidu was among the most visible leaders (male or female) of pre-independent India. As president of the Indian National Congress and the first woman governor of free India, she was a fervent advocate for India, avidly mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement. She was also the first woman to be arrested in the salt march.\\"[68]\\r\\n\\r\\nBritish documents show that the British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about whether or not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including Wedgwood Benn, Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.[67]\\r\\n\\r\\nGandhi himself avoided further active involvement after the march, though he stayed in close contact with the developments throughout India. He created a temporary ashram near Dandi. From there, he urged women followers in Bombay (now Mumbai) to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth. He said that \\"a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth. Schools and colleges should become empty.\\"[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor his next major action, Gandhi decided on a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables.[69] He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).[70]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dharasana Satyagraha went ahead as planned, with Abbas Tyabji, a seventy-six-year-old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi's wife Kasturba at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison. After their arrests, the march continued under the leadership of Sarojini Naidu, a woman poet and freedom fighter, who warned the satyagrahis, \\"You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.\\" Soldiers began clubbing the satyagrahis with steel tipped lathis in an incident that attracted international attention.[71] United Press correspondent Webb Miller reported that:\\r\\n\\r\\nNot one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.\\r\\n[72]\\r\\nVithalbhai Patel, former Speaker of the Assembly, watched the beatings and remarked, \\"All hope of reconciling India with the British Empire is lost forever.\\"[73] Miller's first attempts at telegraphing the story to his publisher in England were censored by the British telegraph operators in India. Only after threatening to expose British censorship was his story allowed to pass. The story appeared in 1,350 newspapers throughout the world and was read into the official record of the United States Senate by Senator John J. Blaine.[74]\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Millions saw the newsreels showing the march. Time magazine declared Gandhi its 1930 Man of the Year, comparing Gandhi's march to the sea \\"to defy Britain's salt tax as some New Englanders once defied a British tea tax.\\"[75] Civil disobedience continued until early 1931, when Gandhi was finally released from prison to hold talks with Irwin. It was the first time the two held talks on equal terms,[76] and resulted in the GandhiÿIrwin Pact. The talks would lead to the Second Round Table Conference at the end of 1931.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalt Satyagraha produced scant progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India, and did not win any major concessions from the British.[77] It also failed to attract Muslim support.[78] Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934. Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi, who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme, which included his efforts to end untouchability in the Harijan movement.[79] Even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s, Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self-rule .[80] The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians ÿ Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent.[81]\\r\\n\\r\\nNehru considered the Salt Satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,[82] and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses....Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance....They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole....It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.[3]\\r\\nMore than thirty years later, Satyagraha and the March to Dandi exercised a strong influence on American civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr., and his fight for civil rights for blacks in the 1960s:\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform.[10]\\r\\nTo commemorate the Great Salt March, the Mahatma Gandhi Foundation re-enacted the Salt March on its 75th anniversary, in its exact historical schedule and route followed by the Mahatma and his band of 80 marchers. The event was known as the \\"International Walk for Justice and Freedom\\". What started as a personal pilgrimage for Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson Tushar Gandhi turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from 9 nations and on a daily basis the numbers swelled to a couple of thousands.  There  was extensive reportage in the international media. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe start of the march on 12 March 2005 in Ahmedabad was attended by Sonia Gandhi, Chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, as well as several Indian Cabinet Ministers, many of whom joined the march at different locations along the route and walked part of the way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe participants halted at Dandi on the night of 5 April, with the commemoration ending on 7 April. At the finale in Dandi, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, greeted the marchers and promised to build an appropriate monument at Dandi to commemorate the marchers and the historical event.   The route from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi has now been christened as the Dandi Path and has been declared a historical heritage route.[83][84]\\r\\n\\r\\nA series of commemorative stamps were issued on the 75th anniversary of the Dandi Marchdenomination INR 5, Date of Issue: 5 April 2005.[85]","input":"What was the main motive of salt march?"},{"output":"Nash Holdings","context":"The Washington Post is an American daily newspaper. Published in Washington, D.C., it was founded on December 6, 1877.[7]\\r\\nLocated in the capital city of the United States, the newspaper has a particular emphasis on national politics. Daily editions are printed for the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. It is published as a broadsheet.\\r\\nThe newspaper has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes. This includes six separate Pulitzers awarded in 2008, the second-highest number ever awarded to a single newspaper in one year, second only to The New York Times' seven awards in 2002.[8] Post journalists have also received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. In the early 1970s, in the best-known episode in the newspaper's history, reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the American press' investigation into what became known as the Watergate scandal; reporting in the newspaper greatly contributed to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. In years since, its investigations have led to increased review of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.[9]\\r\\nIn 2013, its longtime controlling family, the Graham family, sold the newspaper to billionaire entrepreneur and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million in cash.[1][2][10] The newspaper is owned by Nash Holdings LLC, a holding company Bezos created for the acquisition.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Washington Post is generally regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers,[12] along with The New York Times, The L.A. Times, and The Wall Street Journal. The Post has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government. It is one of the two daily broadsheets published in Washington D.C., the other being its smaller rival The Washington Times.\\r\\nUnlike The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its National Weekly Edition, which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation.[13] The majority of its newsprint readership is in District of Columbia and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.[14]\\r\\nThe newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus, located in Beirut, Berlin, Beijing, Bogota, Cairo, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, and Tokyo.[15] In November 2009, it announced the closure of its U.S. regional bureausChicago, Los Angeles and New Yorkas part of an increased focus on \\"...political stories and local news coverage in Washington\\".[16] The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).[17]\\r\\nAs of May 2013[update], its average weekday circulation was 474,767, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, making it the seventh largest newspaper in the country by circulation, behind USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Daily News, and the New York Post. While its circulation (like that of almost all newspapers) has been slipping, it has one of the highest market-penetration rates of any metropolitan news daily.[18]\\r\\nFor many decades, the Post had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street (along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street) for US$159?million in November 2013. The Washington Post continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW.[19] In May 2014, The Washington Post leased the west tower of One Franklin Square, a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C. The newspaper moved into their new offices December 14, 2015.[20]\\r\\nThe newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (1838ÿ1912) and in 1880 added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week. In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed \\"The Washington Post\\".[21] It became the standard music to accompany the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze,[22] and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.\\r\\nIn 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters ÿ newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing ÿ that ran 24 hours per day.[23]\\r\\nIn 1898, during the SpanishÿAmerican War, the Post printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration Remember the Maine, which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the PostDrawing the Line in Mississippi. This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear.[24]\\r\\nWilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the Post for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the Cincinnati Enquirer. During the Wilson presidency, the Post was credited with the \\"most famous newspaper typo\\" in D.C. history according to Reason magazine; the Post intended to report that President Wilson had been \\"entertaining\\" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been \\"entering\\" Mrs. Galt.[25][26][27] When John McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward \\"Ned\\" McLean could manage his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin.\\r\\nThe newspaper was purchased in a bankruptcy auction in 1933 by the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, Eugene Meyer, who restored the newspaper's health and reputation. In 1946, Meyer was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham.[28]\\r\\nIn 1954, the newspaper consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its last morning rival, the Washington Times-Herald.[29] (The combined paper was officially named The Washington Post and Times-Herald until 1973, although the Times-Herald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left the Post with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon Washington Star (Evening Star) and The Washington Daily News, which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981.[30][31] The Washington Times, established in 1982 by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon (1920ÿ2012) under his company News World Communications, has been a local conservative rival with a circulation (as of 2005[update]) about one-seventh that of the Post.[32] In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid-format daily The Washington Examiner by the new owners of the old Hearst paper, the San Francisco Examiner who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous San Francisco Chronicle for the former Hearst \\"flagship\\" paper. They also started several other tabloid-format Examiners in several American cities, including briefly for two years the Baltimore Examiner which competed against the 170-year-old Baltimore Sun. The Washington Examiner ceased publication of its local newspaper on June 14, 2013, still publishing a weekly magazine and an online website focused on national politics.\\r\\nAfter Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to Katharine Graham (1917ÿ2001), his wife and Meyer's daughter. Few women had run nationally prominent newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001.\\r\\nHer tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that The New York Times did not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984.[33] Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.[34]\\r\\nExecutive editor Ben Bradlee, a Kennedy loyalist, put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington. The Post's dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.\\r\\nIn 1972, the \\"Book World\\" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prizeÿwinning critic William McPherson as its first editor.[35] It featured Pulitzer Prizeÿwinning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the Post. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, The Washington Post Book World as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009,[36] along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the \\"Outlook\\" section and distributing some other locally oriented \\"op-ed\\" letters and commentaries in other sections.[37] However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.[37]\\r\\nIn 1980, the newspaper published a dramatic story called \\"Jimmy's World\\",[38] describing the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict in Washington, for which reporter Janet Cooke won acclaim and a Pulitzer Prize. Subsequent investigation, however, revealed the story to be a fabrication. The Pulitzer Prize was returned.\\r\\nDonald E. Graham, Katharine's son, succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. He was succeeded in 2000 as publisher and CEO by Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr., with Graham remaining as chairman.\\r\\nKatharine Graham Weymouth served as publisher and chief executive officer until 2014, after Jeff Bezos took over ownership of the paper.\\r\\nJeff Bezos purchased the newspaper for US$250?million in cash, completing the transaction on October 1, 2013, after announcing the planned acquisition on August 5, 2013.[1][2][10] The newspaper is currently owned by Nash Holdings LLC, a holding company created for the acquisition and controlled by Bezos.[1]\\r\\nThe sale included the Spanish language newspaper El Tiempo Latino, the Fairfax Times, The Gazette, the free daily newspaper Express, Southern Maryland Newspapers, and several newspapers covering and for the U.S. armed forces.[39] Nash Holdings also took ownership of the Post printing plants in Springfield, Virginia; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Laurel, Maryland (the \\"Comprint plant\\").[39][40] Other assets included in the sale were the publications Apartment Showcase, Capital Business, Fashion Washington, Guide to Retirement Living Sourcebook, New Condominium Guide, and New Homes Guide; the Internet sites TheCapitolDeal.com and ServiceAlley.com; and Comprint Military Publications (which included eight weekly newspapers covering local military bases, 10 annual guides to local military bases, and the Web sites DCMilitary.com, DCMilitaryEd.com, DCMilitaryFamLife.com).[40] Some real estate was also included in the deal, such as a one-story office building in St. Mary's County, Maryland; warehouses in Fairfax County, Virginia; two tracts of land in Fairfax County, Virginia; leased office space in Charles County, Maryland, and in Montgomery County, Maryland; and 23 acres of undeveloped land in Charles County, Maryland.[40]\\r\\nNot included in the sale were other Washington Post Company assets, including the Washington Post Company's downtown office building, the Post's Robinson Terminal facilities in Alexandria, Virginia; Post-Newsweek Stations; Cable ONE (a Phoenix, Arizona-based Internet and cable service provider); independent web-based media assets such as Slate Group (Slate magazine and its sister video magazine, Slate V), The Root, and Foreign Policy; social media marketing company Social Code; home healthcare and hospice provider Celtic Healthcare; and the energy parts supplier Forney Corporation.[11][41] After the completion of the sale, a press release announced the name change of the Washington Post Company to Graham Holdings Company (the change was made effective on November 29, 2013).[11][41]\\r\\nIn early September 2013, Bezos summarized his approach for the news organizationwith a vision that recreates \\"the 'daily ritual' of reading the Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories\\"??although he indicated that the experience was more likely to be created on tablet computers and less likely \\"on the Web\\".[42] Bezos has been described as a \\"hands-off owner\\", holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks.[43]\\r\\nIn August 2014, The Washington Post launched \\"Get There\\", an online personal finance section.[44]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Jeff Bezos announced his decision to appoint Frederick J. Ryan Jr., founding President and CEO of Politico, to serve as Publisher and CEO of The Washington Post, effective October 1, 2014. This signaled Bezo's intent to shift The Post to a more digital focus with a strategy for expanding to a broader national and global readership. Ryan has continued to invest in news and technology while reducing expenses in legacy print areas.[45]\\r\\nNash Holdings divested itself of a number of newspapers, and closed two others, in the summer of 2015. The company announced on June 12, 2015, that it would close the Montgomery Gazette and Prince George's Gazette effective June 18, 2015. The company also sold Comprint Military Publications and its Southern Maryland Newspapers group (which consisted of the Maryland Independent, The Enterprise, the Calvert Recorder, and the Enquirer Gazette, and their associated Southern Maryland Newspaper Web site) to Adams Publishing Group. The company also said it would sell the Fairfax County Times to Whip It Media, a locally owned company founded by the Times' former general manager, Richard Whippen.[46]\\r\\nIn August 2014, the Post announced it was moving into new headquarters space at One Franklin Square in December 2015. The company leased 242,000 square feet (22,500?m2) of space for 16 years on floors four through nine in the west tower and floors seven and eight in the east tower. The building's owner agreed to an extensive build-out: Only about 10 percent of the space will be private offices, which required extensive demolition of interior walls and the removal of the walls on the seventh and eighth floor in the east tower so they joined with the floors on the west tower. The newly joined space will create two 60,000-square-foot (5,600?m2) floors capable of accommodating 700 newsroom workers and software engineers. The build-out includes four sets for live television filming, a new staircase between the seventh and eighth floors in each tower, and a two-story auditorium on the fourth floor. The building's south-facing facade will also be altered to give Post workers floor-to-ceiling windows.[47]\\r\\nIn the mid-1970s, some conservatives called the newspaper \\"Pravda on the Potomac\\" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.[48] Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.[49][50] In 1963, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told President Lyndon B. Johnson, \\"I don't have much influence with the Post because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the Daily Worker.\\"[51][52]\\r\\nOn March 26, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, \\"Well, The Washington Post is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you. I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper\\".[53] It has regularly published an ideological mixture of op-ed columnists, some of them left-leaning (including E.?J. Dionne, Dana Milbank, Greg Sargent, and Eugene Robinson), and many on the right (including George Will, Marc Thiessen, Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer).\\r\\nIn a study published on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning Washington Times or the liberal-leaning Washington Post to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the Post slanted as much to the left as the Times did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the Post were 7.9ÿ11.4% more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group, depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer; surprisingly, however, people who received the Times were also more likely than controls to vote for the Democrat, with an effect approximately 60% as large as that estimated for the Post.[54][55] The study authors noted that sampling error might have played a role in the effect of the conservative-leaning Times, as might the fact that the Democratic candidate took more conservative-leaning positions than is typical for his party, and that \\"the month prior to the post-election survey was a difficult period for President Bush, one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide. It appears that heightened exposure to both papers news coverage, despite opposing ideological slants, moved public opinion away from Republicans.\\"[55]\\r\\nIn November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.[56] In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama.[57]\\r\\nResponding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, former Post ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: \\"The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama.\\"[58] According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to The Washington Post and The New York Times more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.[59]\\r\\nIn mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of Forbes joined Glenn Greenwald of the Intercept, and Trevor Trimm of The Guardian in cricitizing The Washington Post for \\"demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden?... stand trial on espionage charges\\".[60][61][62][63]\\r\\nIn December 2016, The Post published a story inaccurately stating that a Russian hacking operation had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid; the claim was retracted in a revised version of the story, after the initial version had been widely circulated.[64][65]\\r\\nIn February 2017, amid a barrage of criticism from President Donald Trump over the paper's coverage of his campaign and early presidency as well as concerns among the American press about Trump's criticism and threats against journalists who provide coverage he deems unfavorable, the Post adopted the slogan \\"Democracy Dies in Darkness\\".[66]\\r\\nKatharine Graham wrote in her autobiography Personal History that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich.[67] In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia.[68] There have also been times when the Post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-Governor Michael Dukakis or then-Vice President George H. W. Bush.[69] On October 17, 2008, the Post endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States.[70] On October 25, 2012, the newspaper endorsed the re-election of Barack Obama.[71] On October 21, 2014, the newspaper endorsed 44 Democratic candidates versus 3 Republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia.[72] On October 13, 2016, it endorsed Hillary Clinton for the presidential election of that year.[73]\\r\\nThe Post's early endorsements in the 1978 elections for Maryland Governor (reformist Harry Hughes) and for D.C. Mayor (a young Marion Barry) allowed those candidates to tout their endorsements, thereby distinguishing them from an otherwise crowded field of big name candidates.\\r\\nJeff Bezos, the owner of the Post, is Amazon's chief executive and biggest shareholder. Amazon has secured a 600 million dollar contract with the CIA, which poses a potential conflict. Kate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, said, \\"It's a serious potential conflict of interest for a major newspaper like The Washington Post to have a contractual relationship with the government and the most secret part of the government.\\"[74]\\r\\nIn Buying the War on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Republican administrations.[75] According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell, \\"By the Post's own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information 'got lost', as one Post staffer told Kurtz.\\"[76]\\r\\nIn November 2016, the Post published a story that relied heavily on a report by PropOrNot, an anonymous internet group that seeks to expose what it calls Russian propaganda. PropOrNot published a list of websites they called \\"bona-fide 'useful idiots'\\" of the Russian government.[77] Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's, was sharply critical of Post's decision to put the story on its front page, calling the article a \\"sorry piece of trash\\".[78] Writers in The Intercept, Fortune, and Rolling Stone also criticized Post for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking in an article on \\"fake news\\".[79][80][81] Looking more carefully into their methodology, Adrian Chen, staff writer for The New Yorker, argued that PropOrNot's criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included \\"not only Russian state-controlled media organizations, such as Russia Today, but nearly every news outlet in the world, including the Post itself\\" on their list.[82]\\r\\n1\\r\\n2\\r\\n3\\r\\n4\\r\\n5\\r\\n6\\r\\n7\\r\\nNBC\\r\\nWall Street Journal\\r\\nAgence France-Presse\\r\\nMSNBC\\r\\nBloomberg BNA\\r\\nWashington Examiner\\r\\nTalk Media News/Univision\\r\\nFox News\\r\\nCBS Radio\\r\\nAP Radio\\r\\nForeign Pool\\r\\nTime\\r\\nYahoo!

After the toppling of the French crown during the French Revolutionary Wars, the United States refused to continue repaying its debt to France on the grounds that it had been owed to a previous regime. French outrage led to a series of attacks on American shipping, ultimately leading to retaliation from the U.S. and the end of hostilities with the signing of the Convention of 1800 shortly thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kingdom of France, a crucial ally of the United States in the American Revolutionary War since early 1776, had loaned the US large sums of money, and had signed in 1778 a treaty of alliance with the United States of America against Great Britain. Louis XVI of France fell from power in 1792 during the French Revolution and the French monarchy was abolished. As a result, in 1794 the American government came to an agreement with the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Jay Treaty, that resolved several points of contention between the United States and Great Britain that had lingered after the end of the American Revolutionary War. It also contained economic clauses.\\r\\nThe United States had already declared neutrality in the conflict between Great Britain and revolutionary France, and American legislation was being passed for a trade deal with Britain. When the U.S. refused to continue repaying its debt using the argument that the debt was owed to the previous government, not to the French First Republic, French outrage led to a series of responses. First, French privateers began seizing American ships trading with Britain and bringing them in as prizes to be sold. Next, the French government refused to receive Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, the new U.S. Minister, when he arrived in Paris in December 1796. In his annual message to Congress at the close of 1797, President John Adams reported on France's refusal to negotiate a settlement and spoke of the need \\"to place our country in a suitable posture of defense.\\"[4] In April 1798, President Adams informed Congress of the \\"XYZ Affair\\", in which French agents demanded a large bribe before engaging in substantive negotiations with United States diplomats.\\r\\nMeanwhile, French privateers inflicted substantial losses on American shipping. On 21 February 1797, Secretary of State Timothy Pickering told Congress that during the previous eleven months, France had seized three hundred and sixteen American merchant ships. French marauders cruised the length of the Atlantic seaboard virtually unopposed. The United States government had nothing to combat them, as the navy had been abolished at the end of the Revolutionary War and its last warship sold in 1785. The United States had only a flotilla of small revenue cutters and a few neglected coastal forts.[5]\\r\\nIncreased depredations by French privateers led to the rebirth of the United States Navy and the creation of the United States Marine Corps to defend the expanding American merchant fleet. Congress authorized the president to acquire, arm, and man not more than twelve ships of up to twenty two guns each. Several merchantmen were immediately purchased and refitted as ships of war,[6] and construction of the frigate Congress resumed.\\r\\nCongress rescinded the treaties with France on 7 July 1798. That date is now considered the beginning of the Quasi-War. This was followed two days later with the passage of the Congressional authorization of attacks on French warships in American waters.\\r\\nThe U.S. Navy operated with a battle fleet of about twenty five vessels, which patrolled the southern coast of the United States and throughout the Caribbean, hunting down French privateers. Captain Thomas Truxtun's insistence on the highest standards of crew training paid dividends when the frigate Constellation captured the French Navy's frigate L'Insurgente and severely damaged the frigate La Vengeance. French privateers generally resisted, as did La Croyable, which was captured on 7 July 1798, by Delaware outside of Egg Harbor, New Jersey.[7] Enterprise captured eight privateers and freed eleven American merchant ships from captivity. Experiment captured the French privateers Deux Amis and Diane. Numerous American merchantmen were recaptured by Experiment. Boston forced Le Berceau into submission. Silas Talbot engineered an expedition to Puerto Plata harbor in Hispaniola. On 11 May 1800, sailors and marines from Constitution under Lieutenant Isaac Hull captured the French privateer Sandwich in the harbor and spiked the guns of the fort.\\r\\nThe U.S. Navy lost only one ship to the French, Retaliation, which was later recaptured. She was the captured privateer La Croyable, recently purchased by the U.S. Navy. Retaliation departed Norfolk on 28 October 1798, with Montezuma and Norfolk, and cruised in the West Indies protecting American commerce. On 20 November 1798, the French frigates LInsurgente and Volontaire overtook Retaliation while her consorts were away and forced commanding officer Lieutenant William Bainbridge to surrender the out-gunned schooner. Montezuma and Norfolk escaped after Bainbridge convinced the senior French commander that those American warships were too powerful for his frigates and persuaded him to abandon the chase. Renamed Magicienne by the French, the schooner again came into American hands on 28 June, when a broadside from Merrimack forced her to haul down her colors.\\r\\nRevenue cutters in the service of the United States Revenue-Marine, the predecessor to the United States Coast Guard, also took part in the conflict. The cutter USRC Pickering, commanded by Edward Preble, made two cruises to the West Indies and captured ten prizes. Preble turned command of Pickering over to Benjamin Hillar, who captured the much larger and more heavily armed French privateer l'Egypte Conquise after a nine-hour battle. In September 1800, Hillar, Pickering, and her entire crew were lost at sea in a storm. Preble next commanded the frigate Essex, which he sailed around Cape Horn into the Pacific to protect American merchantmen in the East Indies. He recaptured several American ships that had been seized by French privateers.[8][9][10]\\r\\nAmerican naval losses may have been light, but the French had successfully seized many American merchant ships by the war's end in 1800more than 2,000, according to one source.[11]\\r\\nAlthough they were fighting the same enemy, the Royal Navy and the United States Navy did not cooperate operationally or share operational plans. There were no mutual understandings about deployment between their forces. The British sold naval stores and munitions to the American government, and the two navies shared a signal system so they could recognise the other's warships at sea and allowed their merchantmen to join each other's convoys for safety.\\r\\nThe fight between USS Constellation and L'Insurgente (William Bainbridge Hoff)\\r\\nA 20th-century illustration depicting United States Marines escorting French prisoners\\r\\nBy late 1800, the United States Navy and the Royal Navy, combined with a more conciliatory diplomatic stance by the government of First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte, had reduced the activity of the French privateers and warships. The Convention of 1800, signed on 30 September, ended the Quasi-War. The news did not arrive in time to help John Adams secure a second term in the 1800 U.S. presidential election.","input":"When did america go to war with france?"},{"output":"November 26, 1989","context":"America's Funniest Home Videos (often simply abbreviated to AFHV or its on-air abbreviation AFV) is an American video clip television series on ABC, which features humorous homemade videos that are submitted by viewers. The most common videos feature unintentional physical comedy (arising from incidents, accidents, and mishaps), pets or children, and some staged practical jokes.\\r\\nOriginally airing as a special in 1989, it debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. It was hosted by Bob Saget for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation, then by John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as D.L. Hughley and Richard Kind, ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in the summer of 2001 with new host Tom Bergeron, who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be departing as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribeiro took over as host in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive produced by Vin Di Bona, Todd Thicke and Michele Nasraway,[1] and created by Vin Di Bona, it is the longest-running primetime entertainment (non-news) program on ABC (both on the network's current schedule and dating back to ABC's incorporation as a television network in 1948). It is based on the Tokyo Broadcasting System program Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan, which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in video clips from their home movies; ABC, which owns half of the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).[2] A more similar concept in that a whole 30-to-45-minute show consisted of nothing but short clips from amateur home videos with slapstick-like accidents presented by a host began broadcasting only two months after the start of Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan in Japan, under the title Pleiten, Pech und Pannen (lit., \\"Crashes, bad luck, and slip ups\\") in Germany in March 1986, that program lasted until 2003.\\r\\nContestants can send their videos in by uploading them as a digital file onto the show's official website, AFV.com, which launched in 2012. From 2008 to 2012, viewers were able to upload their videos digitally to ABC's website, ABC.com; after the separate website for the program went online, users trying to access the America's Funniest Home Videos page on ABC's website ÿ via the show page link on the site's program menu ÿ are now automatically redirected to AFV.com and forwarded to the clip uploading process on that site. Videos can also be sent via conventional mail on VHS and other such home video formats (VHS-C, 8 mm video cassettes, to name a few), and later as the format started to become common for home recording use in the early 2000s decade, DVD to a Hollywood, California post-office box address, with clips placed on USB flash drives and other forms of consumer flash memory formats also acceptable for physical submission as time has gone on.\\r\\nDue to its very low cost and universal appeal, the format has since been reproduced around the world and AFV-inspired television specials and series continue to emerge periodically in the United States. American television series inspired by AFV's format that are not related to the series itself include The Planet's Funniest Animals, The World's Funniest!, The World's Funniest Moments, Funniest Pets & People and It Only Hurts When I Laugh; however, most of the series inspired by AFV (with the minor exception of The Planet's Funniest Animals) have not matched the success of America's Funniest Home Videos and have not lasted as long. Several local television stations, even those not affiliated with ABC, also developed special funny home video segments in their newscasts during the early 1990s, inspired by the series.[3]\\r\\nThe majority of the video clips are short (5ÿ30 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos typically feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past U.S. Presidents), and practical jokes. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1ÿ10) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.[4] Home video material that involves staged accidents, or/and adults, children, or babies getting seriously injured or the abuse of animals or overall does not meet ABC network standards and practices are generally not accepted and will not appear on the show.[5]\\r\\nEvery week, three of the videos seen (which are among those included in the episode) are chosen by the producers and voted on by the studio audience. The winner wins $10,000 and is in the running for the $100,000 prize at the end of a seven- or ten-show run, while the runner-up receives $3,000 and the third place video receives $2,000. In the show's first season, the second and third prizes respectively were a new TV and VCR and a new camcorder. On the initial hour-long special, the grand prize was $5,000 with second and third places both winning a new camcorder; the producer picked the winner, with no audience voting. Periodically, beginning with the Tom Bergeron run of the series and continuing on into the Alfonso Ribiero run, the grand prize winner at each season's final $100,000 contest will also win a free vacation package, supplied by either Adventures by Disney or Disney Vacation Club, in addition to the monetary prize. The program's studio segments are taped in front of a studio audience (although the specials that aired in 1999 and 2000 only featured pre-recorded audience responses); audience members are asked to dress in \\"business casual or nicer\\".[6]\\r\\nShow creator Vin Di Bona has produced two similar programs: America's Funniest People (1990ÿ94) and World's Funniest Videos (1996).[7] Di Bona also created two series featuring home videos that were largely culled from those seen on AFHV and America's Funniest People: the syndicated series That's Funny (2004ÿ06)[8] and the Fox Family Channel series Show Me The Funny (1998ÿ2000). Many of the clips have been used internationally in various comedy compilation programs, with changes such as dubbing and subtitling. The title of the show is usually changed and the studio segments are omitted.\\r\\nAs noted in the closing credits of each episode, most of the videos have been edited for length due to time constraints. In addition, according to the contest plugs, family members (both immediate or relatives) of employees of Vin Di Bona Productions, ABC, Inc., its corporate parent The Walt Disney Company (and for a good portion of Saget's hosting tenure, its legal predecessor, Capital Cities/ABC) and their related subsidiaries are ineligible for the show's contests and prizes.\\r\\nOn October 3, 2010, beginning with the season 21 premiere,[9] America's Funniest Home Videos began broadcasting in high definition. Many of the videos, which are largely shot using standard definition camcorders, began to be stretched horizontally to fit 16:9 screens. However, since the 2012ÿ13 season, videos shot in 4:3 standard definition began to be pillarboxed (particularly videos that are recorded on mobile devices that are shot at a vertical angle that would not even fit the 4:3 safe area of many television sets entirely; since the conversion to HD, the series has featured advisories to viewers to tilt their mobile devices horizontally to when recording in order for their videos to fit 16:9 screens). In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, AFV's 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of AFV) continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of AFV) to be stretched horizontally to this day.\\r\\nThe show debuted on November 26, 1989 as an hour-long special,[10] produced by Vin Di Bona and Steve Paskay, with actor/comedian Bob Saget (then starring in the ABC sitcom Full House) as its host. Saget was assisted in hosting the special by actress Kellie Martin, then the star of fellow ABC series Life Goes On, a family drama which would serve as the lead-in program to AFHV for the latter show's first four seasons. Prior to the airing of the initial special, during the fall of 1989, Vin Di Bona Productions took out ads in national magazines (such as TV Guide) asking people to send in their home videos featuring funny or amazing moments.[11]\\r\\nJohn Ritter was Vin di Bona's first choice as host of the program, but he proved to be unavailable.[12]\\r\\nOriginally intended as a one-off special, it became an unexpected hit, causing ABC to place an episode order for the show turning it into a regular weekly half-hour primetime series;[13] it made its debut as a regular series on January 14, 1990, with Bob Saget hosting solo.[14] Ernie Anderson, the announcer for several ABC advertisements and shows of the era, was the program's original announcer. He was replaced by radio and television actor Gary Owens in 1995, but returned shortly before his death in February 1997.\\r\\nBesides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of AFHV led to a spinoff called America's Funniest People, hosted by Saget's Full House co-star Dave Coulier (and co-hosted by actress/producer Arleen Sorkin for the first two seasons, then model Tawny Kitaen for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people intentionally trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.[15]\\r\\nDuring the show's first four seasons, America's Funniest Home Videos aired on Sunday nights at 8:00?p.m. Eastern Time;[16] beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00?p.m. Eastern, followed by America's Funniest People at 7:30?p.m. Eastern as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.[17] Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \\"Keep those cameras safely rolling\\", and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show.\\r\\nBeginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \\"Assignment America\\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \\"Backwards Classics,\\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \\"Music Montage\\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \\"Stretchy McGillicuddy\\" (voiced by Danny Mann), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \\"Don't get a little touchy Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season.\\r\\nIn 1994, ABC canceled America's Funniest People after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with the Sunday night 7:30?p.m. Eastern slot that was now left vacant. After trying out the short-lived sitcom On Our Own in the 7:30?p.m. slot after AFHV during the 1994ÿ95 season,[18] ABC then later chose to expand America's Funniest Home Videos to one hour with back-to-back airings, with that week's new episode being shown in the first half-hour, followed by a repeat from a previous season to fill the remaining time. On February 1, 1996, another spinoff of AFHV debuted called World's Funniest Videos;[19] which was taped at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; this series was also hosted by Coulier, along with actress Eva LaRue. Paired with a weekly version of the popular Before They Were Stars specials on Thursday nights, World's Funniest Videos focused on funny and amazing home videos from around the world.[20] However, due to low ratings, ABC put it on hiatus a few weeks after its debut,[21] before cancelling the series outright after only one season and burning off the remaining episodes that summer. For Saget's final season on AFHV, two new episodes would be shown.\\r\\nNumerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992ÿ93 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls ÿ though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching America's Funniest Home Videos. This technique was scrapped at the end of the fifth season.\\r\\nSaget soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor, and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character, and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997, and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Vin Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for AFV as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).[22][23] His former Full House castmates (except for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) were present in the episode prior to the $100,000 season finale (which additionally featured 3-D skits as part of an ABC promotional gimmick week), which was his final episode. Saget returned to America's Funniest Home Videos on two different occasions, first, to co-host a 20th anniversary special edition episode alongside Tom Bergeron, which aired on November 29, 2009 (which was four days shy of AFV's actual 20th anniversary date of its premiere on the air on November 26, 1989); and on May 17, 2015, he made a cameo appearance at the end of Tom Bergeron's final episode as host of AFV in Disneyland. He has yet to make his first guest appearance on Alfonso Ribiero's AFV, which would be his third guest appearance on the show and his second guest appearance on the road or in the studio.[24]\\r\\nAfter Saget's departure from the series, ABC sidelined America's Funniest Home Videos from the network's 1997ÿ98 fall schedule, choosing to bring it back as a mid-season replacement.[25] The show began to be alternately called AFV at this point (though the show officially continued to be titled America's Funniest Home Videos). The series returned for season nine on January 5, 1998, with new hosts, an overhauled look and a new rendition of the theme song. Comedian John Fugelsang and model-turned-television personality Daisy Fuentes took over as co-hosts of the show.[26] Jess Harnell also succeeded Owens as the show's announcer and still holds this position to this day.\\r\\nDuring this period, the show introduced a segment called \\"Bad News, Good News,\\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Tom Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \\"AFV Hall of Fame\\", in which a clip is shown, and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \\"Who Would You Like to See...\\", in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.\\r\\nWith the Sunday night 7:00?p.m. Eastern time slot now occupied by Disney films aired as part of The Wonderful World of Disney,[27] the show constantly changed timeslots, moving from Monday nights[28] to Thursday nights[29] to Saturday nights.[30] The ratings for the show suffered during this period, and both Fuentes and Fugelsang left the show after two seasons in 1999. Their last episode ÿ which aired on May 6 of that year ÿ was taped at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, California. The only honorable mention of John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and segments showcasing their run to date was the 2-part 300th episode AFV special in 2003 during the early years of the Bergeron run, which also showcased Saget's run of episodes in select segments, as well. They have yet to make their first guest appearances on the road or in the studio on AFV, as they have never been invited back as guests since their final episodes as co-hosts back in 1999.\\r\\nIn May 1999, ABC announced that it would discontinue America's Funniest Home Videos as a regular weekly series,[31] but the show returned occasionally as a series of specials hosted by various ABC sitcom stars including The Hughleys star D.L. Hughley and Spin City co-star Richard Kind. The show moved to a much smaller soundstage and the set featured various video screens and monitors (resembling iMac computers) placed on shelves. A special sports version of the show called AFV: The Sports Edition, that was hosted by ESPN anchor Stuart Scott, was rebroadcast every New Year's Day and aired occasionally before NBA playoff games with a post 8:30?p.m. Eastern Time tip-off until 2008. A special entitled America's Funniest Home Videos: Deluxe Uncensored (which was released only on home video, and featured somewhat more risque content than that allowed on the television broadcasts) was hosted by Steve Carell and taped on the set used from the 1998ÿ99 season. These specials (except for the special sports edition) were not taped in front of a live studio audience, with pre-recorded applause and laugh tracks were used during commercial bumpers and just before, during, and after video packages being used instead.\\r\\nIn October 2000, ABC announced its decision to return America's Funniest Home Videos as a regular weekly series, ordering 13 new episodes.[32] On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with host Tom Bergeron (who was also hosting Hollywood Squares at the time). By this point, the show was expanded to full hour-long episodes, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes. The show was now being seen on Friday nights at 8:00?p.m. Eastern Time; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the September 11 attacks and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup. That lineup was short-lived, and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the AFV specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors.\\r\\nIn September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00?p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time.\\r\\nThe Bergeron version added new segments, such as \\"Tom's Home Movies\\", where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \\"Head, Gut, or Groin,\\" where Tom picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an America's Funniest Home Videos compilation DVD (since the 2012ÿ13 season, a bobblehead of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \\"slo-mo gizmo\\", where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and telestrated. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \\"If you get it on (video) tape, you could get it in cash\\", which was later changed to \\"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\\" by the 2008ÿ09 season.\\r\\nWhile only four of the segments (\\"Vs.\\", \\"The Dog/Cat Park\\", \\"Name That Sound\\", and \\"A Moment With...\\") continue to be shown on Alfonso Ribiero's AFV at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns) during this period when Tom Bergeron hosted the show include:\\r\\nStarting with the 2007ÿ08 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012ÿ13 season; launched their own website that same year in 2013 and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail. Except for reruns of episodes from seasons 21 and 22 that referenced uploading to ABC.com, the re-edited season 11ÿ20 episodes that used to originally reference ABC.com on the unaltered versions of the episodes now reference uploading to AFV.com.[33] During the 2011ÿ12 season, the AFV iOS app was released on the App Store, allowing users of Apple mobile devices to record and upload videos for submission to the show; a version of the app was released for Android devices the following season.\\r\\nIn the final six seasons of Tom Bergeron's run as host, the show started its \\"Funny Since 1989\\" campaign in 2009 and had two anniversary seasons. Season 20, in 2009, had a special 20th anniversary episode that aired on November 29, 2009. The special brought back Bob Saget to AFV for the first time in 12 years as a guest. Both Saget and Bergeron ended that episode with a pinata party skit and a nod to the Star Wars lightsaber fight scenes when the credits started rolling. The pinatas resembled the looks of the two hosts. Five years later, on March 7, 2014, Bergeron announced on his Twitter account that season 25 would be his last.[34] AFV aired a 25th Anniversary Celebrity Celebration special in February 2015. Bergeron's final new episode from his in-studio stage home of 15 years (which was really his second to final episode) aired on May 10, 2015 (and for the final time in rerun form on ABC on September 13, 2015), and was the final (and season 25's second) $100,000 show of his tenure and featured at different times of the episode a look back at classic and modern funny home videos that defined the show's then-25-year run. Bergeron's \\"real\\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after fifteen seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode ÿ taped on-location at Disneyland for that season's edition of the annual \\"Grand Prize Spectacular\\", AFV's 25th anniversary, and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, or in earlier seasons, an Adventures by Disney vacation package) ÿ featured an auto-tuned montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near Sleeping Beauty Castle following the grand prize presentation on a cart driven by original host Bob Saget in a special cameo appearance. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions. First, on July 19, 2015 to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and again on September 20, 2015 as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of AFV with Tom Bergeron and him as host signing off for the final time. Tom Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \\"Grand Prize Spectacular\\" finale of Alfonso Ribiero's AFV on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \\"Who Breaks It?\\" and won an Alfonso Ribiero AFV pillow and socks.[35][36]\\r\\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Alfonso Ribeiro (known for playing Carlton Banks on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air) would take over as host of AFV beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the season 20 finale of Dancing with the Stars (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the prior season). Before becoming the current host of the show, Alfonso Ribiero made his first (and final) guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of AFV playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Tom Bergeron called \\"Who's Makin' That Racket?\\". While some of the Tom Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience, and background parts of the Tom Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for Alfonso Ribeiro's first three seasons, the stage featured a floor layout and stairway connected to a rubics-like cube with flat-screen TVs and new segments (especially for Alfonso Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The Assignment America and musical montage segments that started in the Bob Saget-era and the honorable mentions segments and Disney Grand Prize Vacation Sweepstakes Contests that started in the Tom Bergeron-era also continued.[37][35][38]\\r\\nIn May 2017, ABC renewed AFV for a 28th season. For the start of the season on October 8, 2017 instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was lead into at the start of the season by The Toy Box. During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), AFV aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. AFV returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central timeslot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017 and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC renewed AFV for a 29th season on March 13, 2018.[39]\\r\\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used during seasons 9, 12, 13, and 14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.[40]\\r\\nAmerica's Funniest Home Videos became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week. When it debuted as a weekly Sunday night series in January 1990, the show averaged an 18.0 rating/27 share, finishing at 16th place.[42] It placed within Nielsen's Top 5 highest-rated weekly series within weeks of its debut;[13] by March 1990, AFHV became the #1 primetime series for a short time, causing CBS' 60 Minutes to be unseated for the top spot in the Nielsen ratings for the first time in 12 years. Indeed there was at least one week in 1990 when America's Funniest Home Videos, when put in the same time slot as 60 Minutes, actually beat 60 Minutes for a win in the time slot. AFHV finished the 1989ÿ90 season in the Top 10 most watched shows, with an approximate average of 38 million viewers[43] for each episode.\\r\\nAFHV finished the 2009ÿ10 season in 55th place, with an approximate average of 7.52 million viewers, and finished in 69th in viewers 18ÿ49, with 2.0/6.[44] In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \\"if you could pick a safe show that appeals to almost everyone, this might be it\\".[45]\\r\\nAFV's original theme song was \\"The Funny Things You Do\\", composed by Dan Slider and performed by Jill Colucci, who also wrote the lyrics with Stewart Harris. This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when Tom Bergeron introduced Bob Saget as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during AFV's first eight seasons) on the show in the AFV 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled AFV XD is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989ÿ97 seasons.[46][better?source?needed] During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for America's Funniest People) and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original.\\r\\nWhen AFHV returned for its ninth season with new hosts Daisy Fuentes and John Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \\"The Funny Things You Do\\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \\"The Impression That I Get\\" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. An alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002ÿ03 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002ÿ03 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on WGN America and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and ABC Family, the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers.\\r\\nFor season 26, with new host Alfonso Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \\"The Funny Things You Do\\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained.\\r\\nThe 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The two later themes used during the post-Saget era have not been released to this day, as they are reportedly being held by Vin Di Bona.\\r\\n\\"The Funny Things You Do\\" was the theme song to the Australian version between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\\r\\nVirtually all episodes of AFHV are, or have been, in syndication. Each period has aired separately. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by 20th Television, which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of MTM Enterprises, which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.[47] Disney-ABC Domestic Television (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies ABC Productions, distributes all versions of the series.\\r\\nThe Bob Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989-94) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). The episodes from Seasons 1-6 Bob Saget aired in off-network syndication. It aired on Pax from 2003-2005, Nick at Nite from April 30, 2007 to October 2007, and Hallmark Channel in 2010-11.\\r\\nIn the Pax airings of the Bob Saget run, when back-to-back episodes aired, the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \\"Now don't go away, here's more of America's Funniest Home Videos!\\" before cutting to Ernie Anderson introducing Saget. Some airings of the Saget version on Pax, Hallmark, and Nick at Nite cut the interviews with the winners, due to time constraints, because of the longer ad breaks that were not seen on U.S. broadcast television during the period that the episodes originally aired on ABC. The contest plugs were retained when Pax aired the episodes; in the Nick at Nite and Hallmark airings, some episodes had the contest plugs replaced with a modern-day contest plug announced by Jess Harnell.\\r\\nThe episodes from Seasons 6-8, aired on ABC Family from September 2004 to April 2007. These episodes had the contest plugs and other outdated information removed. In addition, the end credits of the show have been replaced by ABC Family's generic credits. The ABC Productions and Vin Di Bona logos from 2004 replaced the older logos.\\r\\nThe Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes aired on ABC Family from the fall of 1999 (known as Fox Family and owned by News Corporation at the time), until the fall of 2003.\\r\\nThe Tom Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; WGN America also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011, while alternate versions of the Bergeron (and sometimes the Fugelsang-Fuentes) episodes with the Buena Vista Television tag before the end credits aired in the evening. UpTV began airing (and currently still airs) reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of AFV in (and since) 2016. Months ahead of and in preparation for AFV's 25th anniversary and Tom Bergeron's 15th and final season as host of AFV in season 25, since August 2014, the 2001ÿ2010 Tom Bergeron episodes from past seasons for its syndication rerun airings were re-edited to make them more HD friendly and rid the episodes of \\"some\\" of their outdated promo, contest sweepstakes, and sponsorship references that may no longer be valid. Evidence of the re-editing can be seen when the picture zooms back to its original standard-definition format during the end credits (on WGN America and UpTV only) with the colored bars utilizing the show's different background color schemes from past seasons on the left and right sides of screens. The 2009ÿ2015 Tom Bergeron episodes with a re-edited season 20 package began airing for the first time ever in syndication on TBS on September 15, 2014. On October 3, 2016, some episodes from the 2001ÿ2009 Tom Bergeron-era syndication package that were already airing in reruns on other cable networks for over a decade had finally became part of TBS' early-morning line-up of AFV reruns. Like the initial ABC airings, while the syndicated episodes continue to use all of the different color and logo variations of the ABC Entertainment and Vin Di Bona Productions tags before or after the end credits, depending on the station or cable networks, they have not shown the Buena Vista Television or even the ABC Studios or Disney/ABC Domestic Television distribution tags since Fall 2014.\\r\\nBroadcast syndication airings of the Bergeron-era episodes have censored instances of nudity involving young children, which were uncensored in the original ABC broadcasts.[citation needed]\\r\\nOutside the United States, family-oriented Canadian cable channel YTV has aired AFV on Saturday nights since September 2009.[48] Canadian broadcaster yesTV, with CHEK-DT in British Columbia, also began airing a simulcast of AFV episodes on Sundays at 7 p.m. local time, as it airs on ABC in the U.S. (but factoring simultaneous substitution), starting from season 25, City and its sister network Omni Television was the previous broadcaster in Canada since the Spring of 2010.[citation needed] It also airs on Fox8 in Australia.\\r\\nABC, Shout! Factory, and Slingshot Entertainment have released numerous compilation releases of America's Funniest Home Videos on VHS and DVD in Region 1 (North America).\\r\\nParker Brothers released a board game in 1990. Graphix Zone released a hybrid CD-ROM titled America's Funniest Home Videos: Lights! Camera! InterAction! in 1995.[52] Imagination Games released a DVD game in 2007.\\r\\nAn America's Funniest Home Videos micro movie viewer was released in 1990.[53]","input":"When did america's funniest videos first air?"},{"output":"In 1898, during the SpanishÿAmerican War,","context":"","input":"When was puerto rico annexed by the us?"},{"output":"Luis \\"Huero Buff\\" Flores","context":"Sure?os gangs[9]\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia (Spanish: Mafia Mexicana), also known as La eMe (Spanish for \\"the M\\"), is a highly organized Mexican American criminal organization in the United States.[1][4] Despite its name, the Mexican Mafia did not originate in Mexico, and is entirely a U.S. criminal prison organization. Sure?o gangs use the number 13 to show allegiance to the Mexican Mafia. M is the 13th letter of the alphabet. Law enforcement officials report that La eMe is the most powerful gang within the California prison system.[15] Government officials state that there are currently 155ÿ300 official members of the Mexican Mafia with around 990 associates who assist La eMe in carrying out its illegal activities in the hopes of becoming full members.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia was formed in 1957 by 13 Hispanic street gang members from different Los Angeles neighborhoods that were all incarcerated at the Deuel Vocational Institution, a California Youth Authority facility, which is now an adult state prison in Tracy, California.[16][5] They formed in order to protect themselves from other prison gangs at the time.[4][17] One of the founders of La eMe is Luis \\"Huero Buff\\" Flores who was an active member of the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens gang in Hawaiian Gardens, California. Gang warfare between Hispanic neighborhoods was the norm during the 1950s and 60s so the fact that Luis Flores was able to get established enemies to set aside their rivalries upon entry into the prison system was something that was not thought possible. This requirement exists to the present day. Hispanic street gangs like White Fence, The Avenues, Clanton 14, San Fer, Varrio Nuevo Estrada, and the oldest most prominent of them all, Primera Flats,[18] were already into their second decade and firmly established as self-sustaining entities.[3]\\r\\nLuis Flores initially recruited violent members to the gang in an attempt to create a highly feared organization which could control the black market activities of the Deuel prison facilities. La eMe member Ramon \\"Mundo\\" Mendoza claims that in the beginning the overall goal was to terrorize the prison system and enjoy prison comforts while doing time. It is said that the name \\"Mexican Mafia\\" was to show organization similar to the American Mafia but it was later changed to not be confused with it. Furthermore, the black hand symbol was a reference to the Black Hand of the early 20th century.[14]\\r\\nBy 1961 violence got so bad at the Deuel Vocational Institution that administrators transferred a number of the charter La Eme members to San Quentin Penitentiary in the hopes of discouraging their violent behavior. This tactic failed. Cheyenne Cadena arrived on the lower yard of San Quentin and was met by a six-foot-five, 300-pound black inmate who kissed him. Cadena returned a short time later, walked up to the unsuspecting predator, and stabbed him to death with a jailhouse knife, or shank. There were more than a thousand inmates on the yard and no witnesses stepped forward.[14]\\r\\nA string of other slayings soon followed as La eMe members sought to establish a reputation among the inmates of San Quentin. The Mexican Mafia's quest for complete control alienated many other Mexican-American inmates who were fed up with Mexican Mafia stabbing, killing, and stealing their watches, rings, cigarettes and anything else of value. Some of them secretly founded a new prison gang called La Nuestra Familia (NF) or \\"Our Family.\\" It was first established in the mid-1960s at the California Correctional Training Facility in Soledad. Some of the early members were from the Los Angeles area, but NF soon drew inmates primarily from rural communities in Northern California. The Mexican Mafia saw Nuestra Familia as inferior and \\"just a bunch of farmers\\", or farmeros. However, in 1968 at San Quentin, a full-scale riot broke out after a Mexican Mafia soldier, or soldado, stole a pair of shoes from a Nuestra Familia sympathizer. Nineteen inmates were stabbed and one La eMe associate ended up dead. The battle became known as the \\"Shoe War\\" and it established Nuestra Familia as the major La eMe rival.[14][19]\\r\\nLa eMe should not be confused with the New Mexican Mafia. Around 1974, a group of Hispanic inmates at Arizona State Prison, Florence, formed a prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia.[20] Arizona Department of Corrections officials at that time obtained information that this group patterned themselves after the California Mexican Mafia which had been in existence for several years. Several Hispanics who came into the Arizona Prison System brought the concept and philosophy of the California Mexican Mafia.[20] In 1978 the Mexican Mafia split into two organizations. One kept the original philosophy and structure and currently refer to themselves as the Original Mexican Mafia, \\"Califas Faction\\", \\"EME\\".[20] The other, which came into prominence in 1984 and refer to themselves as the New Mexican Mafia. Many assaults and murders of members of both groups have occurred as a result of each organization claiming the title of \\"Mexican Mafia\\" within the Arizona prison system. They have created their own rules and regulations and have established an organizational structure.[20] Each member is allowed to vote on issues regarding membership and leadership. The leader, approved by the members, has the power to solely decide important issues.\\r\\nLaw enforcement believes that La eMe presently is not presided over by a single leader. Many Mexican Mafia members have the authority to order murders and oversee various other criminal activities. They have almost a thousand associates that help carry out those orders and have the theoretical control of all Sure?o gang members.[8][17] Members are expected to engage in tests of their loyalty to La eMe, which may include theft or murder. The penalty for refusing orders or failing to complete an assigned task is often death. According to the gang's constitution, members may also be punished or murdered if they commit any of four major infractions. These include becoming an informant, acts of homosexuality, acts of cowardice, and showing disrespect against fellow gang members. According to gang policy, a member of the Mexican Mafia may not be murdered without prior approval by a vote of three members, yet the murder of non-members requires no formal approval.\\r\\nDuring the early 1960s at San Quentin Prison, Luis Flores and Rudy \\"Cheyenne\\" Cadena established a blood oath for members of the Mexican Mafia. Prior to the establishment of the oath, members of the Mexican Mafia were allowed to return to their street gangs after incarceration. The new oath stipulated that the only way for a member to leave the Mexican Mafia was to be killed. Flores and Cadena also established a set of gang commandments. These included policies such as: a new member must be sponsored by an existing member, unanimous approval from all existing members to join (no longer policy), prioritizing the gang over one's family, denial of the existence of the Mexican Mafia to law enforcement or non-members, respect of other members, and forgiving street conflicts which existed before incarceration. Execution of a member of the gang for policy violation must be committed by the gang member who sponsored him. La eMe has a blood in blood out credo: Murder or drawing of blood is a prerequisite for membership and anyone trying to get out will be killed.[12]\\r\\nThe rules of conduct are:\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia is the controlling organization for almost every Hispanic gang in Southern California, and some gangs located in central and northern California. Members of almost all Hispanic gangs in Southern California are obliged under the threat of death to carry out any and all orders from made Mexican Mafia members. The Mexican Mafia also holds a loose alliance with the Aryan Brotherhood, mainly due to their common rivals within the prison system.[12] The primary rivals of the Mexican Mafia are Nuestra Familia.[21] The Mexican Mafia is also a rival of the Black Guerrilla Family prison gang, which holds a loose alliance with La Nuestra Familia. Bloods and Crips are the new enemies.[21]\\r\\nMexican Mafia symbols include images of a black hand. The gang's primary symbol, which is often used in tattoos by members, is the national symbol of Mexico (eagle and a snake) atop a flaming circle over crossed knives. Street gangs that are aligned with the Mexican Mafia often use the number 13 as a gang identifier, as the letter \\"M\\" is the 13th letter of the modern Latin-derived alphabet.\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia received mainstream notoriety after being featured in the 1992 movie American Me. The film was co-produced, directed and starred in by actor Edward James Olmos, who allegedly received death threats by members of the Mexican Mafia for what they considered an unflattering depiction of the gang.[22] Two consultants for the film were murdered shortly after the film's release, though it is unclear whether the murders were tied to the Mexican Mafia or to recent layoffs that had provoked death threats.[22] The Mexican Mafia was allegedly displeased with the portrayal of the murder of Rodolfo Cadena (who was the basis for Olmos' character Santana) as being committed by his fellow gang members.[22] Mexican Mafia members were also allegedly offended by the portrayal of homosexual rape committed by Puppet, a Mexican Mafia character in the film who in the latter part of the movie murders his own brother, Li'l Puppet, for disrespecting La eMe.[23] Olmos subsequently applied for a concealed handgun permit, which was denied to him.[24] Joe Morgan, while serving a life sentence for murder at Pelican Bay State Prison, filed a $500,000 lawsuit against Olmos, Universal Studios, and other producers of the film. Morgan claimed that one of the principal characters in the film was based on him without obtaining his permission.[22]\\r\\nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mexican Mafia had arranged for contract killings to be carried out by the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. Both the Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are mutual enemies of the African-American gang Black Guerrilla Family.[25] Even though homosexuals are barred from entry into La eMe, they are engaged heavily in homosexual prostitution in the prison system.[4][7][15] Many of the street level homicides in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles committed by the Avenues gang were done on orders issued by the Mexican Mafia.[3]\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia is involved in a variety of criminal activities both inside and outside the prison system, but its main source of income is extorting drug distributors outside prison and distributing various narcotics within and outside the prison system.[7] In 1992, an example of La eMe's influence and power over Sure?os was made clear to law enforcement. Joe Morgan, a prominent Mexican Mafia leader, ordered that no more drive-by shootings and violence was to take place by Sure?os.[11] Between April, when the edict was announced, and September 1992 there were no drive-by shootings in East Los Angeles and this area was notorious for violence and drive-bys.[11]\\r\\nThe first murder outside of prison that was ordered by La eMe occurred in 1971 when Mexican Mafia member Alfonso \\"Pachie\\" Alvarez was found shot twice in the head in a secluded area of Monterey Park. His offense: collecting taxes on narcotics dealers without kicking up the profits to eMe leaders behind bars, known in the gang as \\"Big Homies\\" or Emeros.[5] The person responsible for the murder was Joe \\"Pegleg\\" Morganthe notorious white godfather of La eMe who had ascended by then to become one of the highest-ranking bosses of the entire eMe organization, even with no \\"official\\" Mexican blood himself. His connections with cocaine and heroin suppliers in Mexico helped pave the foundation for the Mexican Mafia's narcotics distribution throughout California. During the 1970s, while under the control of Morgan's protg Rodolfo Cadena, the Mexican Mafia often took control over various community groups. The gang was able to filter money from alcohol and drug prevention programs to finance their criminal activities.[3]\\r\\nThe Mexican Mafia and the Italian-American Los Angeles crime family collaborated in skimming money from Get Going, a taxpayer-funded drug treatment program. By 1977, Get Going founder Ellen Delia was determined to expose the infiltration of her beloved program. Shortly before an appointment with the California State Secretary of Health and Welfare Services, Delia was murdered. Her collection of evidence on Italian and Mexican Mafia infiltration of the Get Going program was never recovered.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlfred Arthur Sandoval a.k.a. Chato (Arizona Maravilla - East Los Angeles, California), a high ranking eMe member, shot and killed Gilbert Martinez and Anthony Aceves; a third victim Manuel Torres survived the attack. Ray and Marlene Wells were also shot execution style in their home in Belvedere Park. Alfred Sandoval was also charged in these murders. Finally in 2000, Alfred Arthur Sandoval, the highest ranking Eme member (now) in California, had his death sentence for the murder of Marlene Wells overturned by the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1998, United States federal authorities indicted 22 members and associates of the Mexican Mafia, charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act with crimes which included extortion, murder, and kidnapping.[26] One of the arrested members, Benjamin \\"Topo\\" Peters (Arizona Maravilla), was allegedly the Mexican Mafia's highest-ranking member at the time, and was engaged in a power struggle with fellow member Ruben \\"Tupi\\" Hernandez (Onterio Varrio Sur - Ontario, California).[26] Another indicted member was accused of having plotted the death of an anti-gang activist who served as a consultant for the film American Me. The indictments marked a two-year investigation by federal, local, and state law enforcement officials.[26]\\r\\nIn 2006, a 36-count federal indictment was brought against members of the Mexican Mafia. The arrests were made for alleged acts of violence, drug dealing, and extortion against smaller Latino street gangs. According to the federal indictment, Mexican Mafia members exert their influence in both federal and state prison systems through either violence or the threat of violence. Members and associates of the gang remain fiercely loyal to the criminal organization both in and outside of prison, particularly in Southern California cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego. The gang asserts its influence over Chicano gangs throughout Southern California by threatening violence against their members should they ever become incarcerated. Gangs and drug dealers who refuse to pay a protection \\"tax\\" to the Mexican Mafia are often murdered or threatened with murder. High-ranking members of the Mexican Mafia who are locked in private cells for 23 hours of each day are still able to communicate with their associates, through methods which range from tapping in code on prison plumbing pipes to smuggled letters. The primary goal of the Mexican Mafia is to control all drug trafficking in all areas that they have been established.[17]\\r\\nIn early 2012 there was a federal indictment of 119 San Diego County gang members, including a Mexican Mafia boss that was arrested in a raid of his San Marcos home, portrays a sprawling, well-organized criminal network that ran drug dealing on the streets of North County and even extended inside the Vista jail.[27] Rudy \\"Crazy\\" Espudo (Esco Varrio Diablos - Escondido, California) was in control of the Hispanic gangs in the area and forced drug dealers to pay taxes in tribute to La eMe or face the consequences.[27] The local gangs were smuggling narcotics into the Vista Detention Center in order to sell them for the Mexican Mafia. On North County streets la eMe ordered Surenos to obtain taxes from the local drug dealers.[27] Members of the Azusa 13 gang, associated with the Mexican Mafia, were indicted in 2011 for harassing and intimidating black people in Southern California.[28]","input":"Who is the founder of the mexican mafia?"},{"output":"single-core","context":"Pentium 4 is a line of single-core central processing units (CPUs) for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers introduced by Intel on November 20, 2000[1] and shipped through August 8, 2008.[2] They had a seventh-generation x86 (32-bit) microarchitecture, called NetBurst, which was the company's first all-new design since the introduction of the P6 microarchitecture of the Pentium Pro CPUs in 1995. NetBurst differed from P6 (Pentium III, II, etc.) by featuring a very deep instruction pipeline to achieve very high clock speeds. Intel claimed that NetBurst would allow clock speeds of up to 10?GHz in future chips; however, severe problems with heat dissipation (especially with the Prescott Pentium 4) limited CPU clock speeds to a much lower 3.8?GHz.[3]\\r\\nIn 2004, the initial 32-bit x86 instruction set of the Pentium 4 microprocessors was extended by the 64-bit x86-64 set.\\r\\nThe first Pentium 4 cores, codenamed Willamette, were clocked from 1.3?GHz to 2?GHz. They were released on November 20, 2000, using the Socket 423 system. Notable with the introduction of the Pentium 4 was the 400?MT/s FSB. It actually operated at 100?MHz, but the FSB was quad-pumped, meaning that the maximal transfer rate was four times the base clock of the bus, so it was marketed to run at 400?MHz. The AMD Athlon's double-pumped FSB was running at 100 or 133?MHz (200 or 266?MT/s) at that time.\\r\\nPentium 4 CPUs introduced the SSE2 and, in the Prescott-based Pentium 4s, SSE3 instruction sets to accelerate calculations, transactions, media processing, 3D graphics, and games. Later versions featured Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT), a feature to make one physical CPU work as two logical CPUs. Intel also marketed a version of their low-end Celeron processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture (often referred to as Celeron 4), and a high-end derivative, Xeon, intended for multiprocessor servers and workstations. In 2005, the Pentium 4 was complemented by the Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition dual-core CPUs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn benchmark evaluations, the advantages of the NetBurst microarchitecture were unclear. With carefully optimized application code, the first Pentium 4s outperformed Intel's fastest Pentium III (clocked at 1.13?GHz at the time), as expected. But in legacy applications with many branching or x87 floating-point instructions, the Pentium 4 would merely match or run more slowly than its predecessor. Its main handicap was a shared unidirectional bus. Furthermore, the NetBurst microarchitecture consumed more power and emitted more heat than any previous Intel or AMD microarchitectures.\\r\\nAs a result, the Pentium 4's introduction was met with mixed reviews: Developers disliked the Pentium 4, as it posed a new set of code optimization rules. For example, in mathematical applications, AMD's lower-clocked Athlon (the fastest-clocked model was clocked at 1.2?GHz at the time) easily outperformed the Pentium 4, which would only catch up if software was re-compiled with SSE2 support. Tom Yager of Infoworld magazine called it \\"the fastest CPU - for programs that fit entirely in cache\\". Computer-savvy buyers avoided Pentium 4 PCs due to their price premium, questionable benefit, and initial restriction to Rambus RAM. In terms of product marketing, the Pentium 4's singular emphasis on clock frequency (above all else) made it a marketer's dream. The result of this was that the NetBurst microarchitecture was often referred to as a marchitecture by various computing websites and publications during the life of the Pentium 4. It was also called \\"NetBust,\\" a term popular with reviewers who reflected negatively upon the processor's performance.\\r\\nThe two classical metrics of CPU performance are IPC (instructions per cycle) and clock speed. While IPC is difficult to quantify due to dependence on the benchmark application's instruction mix, clock speed is a simple measurement yielding a single absolute number. Unsophisticated buyers would simply consider the processor with the highest clock speed to be the best product, and the Pentium 4 had the fastest clock speed. Because AMD's processors had slower clock speeds, it countered Intel's marketing advantage with the \\"megahertz myth\\" campaign. AMD product marketing used a \\"PR-rating\\" system, which assigned a merit value based on relative performance to a baseline machine.\\r\\nAt the launch of the Pentium 4, Intel stated that NetBurst-based processors were expected to scale to 10?GHz after several fabrication process generations. However, the clock speed of processors using the NetBurst microarchitecture reached a maximum of 3.8?GHz. Intel had not anticipated a rapid upward scaling of transistor power leakage that began to occur as the die reached the 90?nm lithography and smaller. This new power leakage phenomenon, along with the standard thermal output, created cooling and clock scaling problems as clock speeds increased. Reacting to these unexpected obstacles, Intel attempted several core redesigns (\\"Prescott\\" most notably) and explored new manufacturing technologies, such as using multiple cores, increasing FSB speeds, increasing the cache size, and using a longer instruction pipeline along with higher clock speeds. These solutions failed, and from 2003 to 2005, Intel shifted development away from NetBurst to focus on the cooler-running Pentium M microarchitecture. On January 5, 2006, Intel launched the Core processors, which put greater emphasis on energy efficiency and performance per clock cycle. The final NetBurst-derived products were released in 2007, with all subsequent product families switching exclusively to the Core microarchitecture.\\r\\nPentium 4 processors have an integrated heat spreader (IHS) that prevents the die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting cooling solutions. Prior to the IHS, a CPU shim was sometimes used by people worried about damaging the core. Overclockers sometimes removed the IHS from Socket 423 and Socket 478 chips to allow for more direct heat transfer. On processors using the Socket LGA 775 (Socket T) interface, the IHS is directly soldered to the die or dies, making it difficult to remove.\\r\\nWillamette, the project codename for the first NetBurst microarchitecture implementation, experienced long delays in the completion of its design process. The project was started in 1998, when Intel saw the Pentium II as their permanent line. At that time, the Willamette core was expected to operate at frequencies up to about 1?GHz. However, the Pentium III was released while Willamette was still being finished. Due to the radical differences between the P6 and NetBurst microarchitectures, Intel could not market Willamette as a Pentium III, so it was marketed as the Pentium 4.\\r\\nOn November 20, 2000, Intel released the Willamette-based Pentium 4 clocked at 1.4 and 1.5?GHz. Most industry experts regarded the initial release as a stopgap product, introduced before it was truly ready. According to these experts, the Pentium 4 was released because the competing Thunderbird-based AMD Athlon was outperforming the aging Pentium III, and further improvements to the Pentium III were not yet possible.[citation needed] This Pentium 4 was produced using a 180?nm process and initially used Socket 423 (also called socket W, for \\"Willamette\\"), with later revisions moving to Socket 478 (socket N, for \\"Northwood\\"). These variants were identified by the Intel product codes 80528 and 80531 respectively.\\r\\nOn the test bench, the Willamette was somewhat disappointing to analysts in that not only was it unable to outperform the Athlon and the highest-clocked Pentium IIIs in all testing situations, but it was not superior to the budget segment's AMD Duron.[4] Although introduced at prices of $644 (1.4?GHz) and $819 (1.5?GHz) for 1000 quantities to OEM PC manufacturers[citation needed] (prices for models for the consumer market varied by retailer), it sold at a modest but respectable rate, handicapped somewhat by the requirement for relatively fast yet expensive Rambus Dynamic RAM (RDRAM). The Pentium III remained Intel's top selling processor line, with the Athlon also selling slightly better than the Pentium 4. While Intel bundled two RDRAM modules with each boxed Pentium 4, it did not facilitate Pentium 4 sales and was not considered a true solution by many.\\r\\nIn January 2001, a still slower 1.3?GHz model was added to the range, but over the next twelve months, Intel gradually started reducing AMD's leadership in performance. In April 2001 a 1.7?GHz Pentium 4 was launched, the first model to provide performance clearly superior to the old Pentium III. July saw 1.6 and 1.8?GHz models and in August 2001, Intel released 1.9 and 2?GHz Pentium 4s. In the same month, they released the 845 chipset that supported much cheaper PC133 SDRAM instead of RDRAM.[5] The fact that SDRAM was so much cheaper caused the Pentium 4's sales to grow considerably.[5] The new chipset allowed the Pentium 4 to quickly replace the Pentium III, becoming the top-selling mainstream processor on the market.\\r\\nThe Willamette code name is derived from the Willamette Valley region of Oregon, where a large number of Intel's manufacturing facilities are located.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn January 2002 Intel released Pentium 4s with a new core code named \\"Northwood\\" at speeds of 1.6?GHz, 1.8?GHz, 2?GHz and 2.2?GHz.[6][7] Northwood (product code 80532) combined an increase in the L2 cache size from 256 KB to 512 KB (increasing the transistor count from 42 million to 55 million) with a transition to a new 130?nm fabrication process.[7] Making the processor out of smaller transistors means that it can run at higher clock speeds and produce less heat. In the same month boards utilizing the 845 chipset were released with enabled support for DDR SDRAM which provided double the bandwidth of PC133 SDRAM, and alleviated the associated high costs of using Rambus RDRAM for maximal performance with Pentium 4.[citation needed]\\r\\nA 2.4?GHz Pentium 4 was released on April 2, 2002, and the bus speed increased from 400?MT/s to 533?MT/s (133?MHz physical clock) for the 2.26?GHz, 2.4?GHz, and 2.53?GHz models in May, 2.66?GHz and 2.8?GHz models in August, and 3.06?GHz model in November. With Northwood, the Pentium 4 came of age. The battle for performance leadership remained competitive (as AMD introduced faster versions of the Athlon XP) but most observers agreed that the fastest-clocked Northwood-based Pentium 4 was usually ahead of its rival.[citation needed] This was particularly so in mid-2002, when AMD's changeover to its 130?nm production process did not help the initial \\"Thoroughbred A\\" revision Athlon XP CPUs to clock high enough to overcome the advantages of Northwood in the 2.4 to 2.8?GHz range.[8]\\r\\nThe 3.06?GHz Pentium 4 enabled Hyper-Threading Technology that was first supported in Foster-based Xeons. This began the convention of virtual processors (or virtual cores) under x86 by enabling multiple threads to be run at the same time on the same physical processor.[citation needed] By shuffling two (ideally differing) program instructions to simultaneously execute through a single physical processor core, the goal is to best utilize processor resources that would have otherwise been unused from the traditional approach of having these single instructions wait for each other to execute singularly through the core. This initial 3.06?GHz 533FSB Pentium 4 Hyper-Threading enabled processor was known as Pentium 4 HT and was introduced to mass market by Gateway in November 2002.\\r\\nOn April 14, 2003, Intel officially launched the new Pentium 4 HT processor. This processor used an 800?MT/s FSB (200?MHz physical clock), was clocked at 3?GHz, and had Hyper-Threading Technology (which is what the HT moniker represents).[9] This was meant to help the Pentium 4 better compete with AMD's Opteron line of processors. The server-oriented Opteron initially did not share a common socket with AMD's desktop processor line (Socket A). Because of this, motherboard manufacturers did not initially build motherboards with AGP for Opterons. As AGP was the primary graphics expansion port for desktop use, this oversight prevented the Opteron from encroaching from the server market and threatening the Pentium 4 desktop market. Meanwhile, with the launch of the Athlon XP 3200+ in AMD's desktop line, AMD increased the Athlon XP's FSB speed from 333?MT/s to 400?MT/s, but it was not enough to hold off the new 3?GHz Pentium 4 HT.[10] The Pentium 4 HT's increase to a 200?MHz quad-pumped bus (200x4=800Mhz effective) greatly helped to satisfy the bandwidth requirements the Netburst architecture desired for reaching optimal performance. While the Athlon XP architecture was less dependent on bandwidth, the bandwidth numbers reached by Intel were well out of range for the Athlon's EV6 bus. Hypothetically, EV6 could have achieved the same bandwidth numbers, but only at speeds unreachable at the time. Intel's higher bandwidth proved useful in benchmarks for streaming operations[citation needed], and Intel marketing wisely capitalized on this as a tangible improvement over AMD's desktop processors[citation needed]. Northwood 2.4?GHz, 2.6?GHz and 2.8?GHz variants were released on May 21, 2003. A 3.2?GHz variant was launched on June 23, 2003 and the final 3.4?GHz version arrived on February 2, 2004.\\r\\nOverclocking early stepping Northwood cores yielded a startling phenomenon. While core voltage approaching 1.7 V and above would often allow substantial additional gains in overclocking headroom, the processor would slowly (over several months or even weeks) become more unstable over time with a degradation in maximum stable clock speed before dying and becoming totally unusable. This became known as Sudden Northwood Death Syndrome (SNDS), which is caused by electromigration.[11]\\r\\nAlso based on the Northwood core, the Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor - M[12] was released on April 23, 2002 and included Intel's SpeedStep and Deeper Sleep technologies. Intel's naming conventions made it difficult at the time of the processor's release to identify the processor model. There was the Pentium III mobile chip, the Mobile Pentium 4-M, the Mobile Pentium 4, and then just the Pentium M which itself was based on the Pentium III and significantly faster than the former three. Its TDP is about 35 watts in most applications. This lowered power consumption was due to lowered core voltage, and other features mentioned previously.\\r\\nUnlike the desktop Pentium 4, the Pentium 4-M did not feature an integrated heat spreader (IHS), since it operates at a lower voltage. The lower voltage means lower power consumption, and in turn less heat. However, according to Intel specifications, the Pentium 4-M had a maximum thermal junction temperature rating of 100 degrees C, approximately 40 degrees higher than the desktop Pentium 4.\\r\\nThe Mobile Intel Pentium 4 Processor[13] was released to address the problem of putting a full desktop Pentium 4 processor into a laptop, which some manufacturers were doing. The Mobile Pentium 4 used a 533?MT/s FSB, following the desktop Pentium 4's evolution. Oddly, increasing the bus speed by 133?MT/s (33?MHz) caused a massive increase in TDPs, as mobile Pentium 4 processors emitted 59.8ÿ70 W of heat, with the Hyper-Threading variants emitting 66.1ÿ88 W. This allowed the mobile Pentium 4 to bridge the gap between the desktop Pentium 4 (up to 115 W TDP), and the Pentium 4-M (up to 35 W TDP).\\r\\nIn September 2003, at the Intel Developer Forum, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition (P4EE) was announced, just over a week before the launch of Athlon 64 and Athlon 64 FX. The design was mostly identical to Pentium 4 (to the extent that it would run in the same motherboards), but differed by an added 2 MB of level 3 cache. It shared the same Gallatin core as the Xeon MP, though in a Socket 478 form factor (as opposed to Socket 603 for the Xeon MP) and with an 800?MT/s bus, twice as fast as that of the Xeon MP.\\r\\nWhile Intel maintained that the Extreme Edition was aimed at gamers, critics viewed it as an attempt to steal the Athlon 64's launch thunder, nicknaming it the \\"Emergency Edition\\". With a price tag of $999, it was also referred to as the \\"Expensive Edition\\" or \\"Extremely Expensive\\".\\r\\nThe added cache generally resulted in a noticeable performance increase in most processor intensive applications. Multimedia encoding and certain games benefited the most, with the Extreme Edition outperforming the Pentium 4, and even the two Athlon 64 variants, although the lower price and more balanced performance of the Athlon 64 (particularly the non-FX version) led to it usually being seen as the better value proposition. Nonetheless, the Extreme Edition did achieve Intel's apparent aim, which was to prevent AMD from being the performance champion with the new Athlon 64, which was winning every single major benchmark over the existing Pentium 4s.\\r\\nIn January 2004 a 3.4?GHz version was released for Socket 478, and in Summer 2004 the CPU was released using the new Socket 775. A slight performance increase was achieved in late 2004 by increasing the bus speed from 800?MT/s to 1066?MT/s, resulting in a 3.46?GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition. By most metrics, this was on a per-clock basis the fastest single-core NetBurst processor that was ever produced, even outperforming many of its successor chips (not counting the dual-core Pentium D). Afterwards, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was migrated to the Prescott core. The new 3.73?GHz Extreme Edition had the same features as a 6x0-sequence Prescott 2M, but with a 1066?MT/s bus. In practice however, the 3.73?GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition almost always proved to be slower than the 3.46?GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition, which is most likely due to the lack of an L3 cache and the longer instruction pipeline. The only advantage the 3.73?GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition had over the 3.46?GHz Pentium 4 Extreme Edition was the ability to run 64-bit applications since all Gallatin-based Pentium 4 Extreme Edition processors lacked the Intel 64 instruction set.\\r\\nAlthough never a particularly good seller, especially since it was released in a time when AMD were asserting near total dominance in the processor performance race, the Pentium 4 Extreme Edition established a new position within Intel's product line, that of an enthusiast oriented chip with the highest-end specifications offered by Intel chips, along with unlocked multipliers to allow for easier overclocking. In this role it has since been succeeded by the Pentium Extreme Edition (The Extreme version of the dual-core Pentium D), the Core 2 Extreme, the Core i7 and most recently, the Core i9.\\r\\nOn February 1, 2004, Intel introduced a new core codenamed \\"Prescott\\". The core used the 90 nm process for the first time, which one analyst described as \\"a major reworking of the Pentium 4's microarchitecture.\\"[14] Despite this overhaul, the performance gains were inconsistent. Some programs benefited from Prescott's doubled cache and SSE3 instructions, whereas others were harmed by its longer pipeline. The Prescott's microarchitecture allowed slightly higher clock speeds, but not nearly as high as Intel had anticipated. The fastest mass-produced Prescott-based Pentium 4s were clocked at 3.8?GHz. While Northwood ultimately achieved clock speeds 70% higher than Willamette, Prescott scaled 12% beyond Northwood. Prescott's inability to achieve greater clock speeds was attributed to the very high power consumption and heat output of the processor. This led to the processor receiving the nickname \\"PresHot\\" on forums.[citation needed] In fact, Prescott's power and heat characteristics were only slightly higher than those of Northwood of the same speed and nearly equal to the Gallatin-based Extreme Editions, but since those processors had already been operating near the limits of what was considered thermally acceptable, this still posed a major issue.[15]\\r\\nThe \\"Prescott\\" Pentium 4 contains 125 million transistors and has a die area of 112?mm2.[16][17] It was fabricated in a 90?nm process with seven levels of copper interconnect.[17] The process has features such as strained silicon transistors and Low-K carbon-doped silicon oxide (CDO) dielectric, which is also known as organosilicate glass (OSG).[17] The Prescott was first fabricated at the D1C development fab and was later moved to F11X production fab.[17]\\r\\nOriginally, Intel released two Prescott lines: the E-series, with an 800?MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading support, and the low-end A-series, with a 533?MT/s FSB and Hyper-Threading disabled. Intel eventually added XD Bit (eXecute Disable) and Intel 64 functionality to Prescott.\\r\\nLGA 775 Prescott uses a rating system, labeling them as the 5xx series (Celeron Ds are the 3xx series, while Pentium Ms are the 7xx series). The LGA 775 version of the E-series uses model numbers 5x0 (520-560), and the LGA 775 version of the A-series uses model numbers 5x5 and 5x9 (505-519). The fastest, the 570J and 571, is clocked at 3.8?GHz. Plans to mass-produce a 4?GHz Pentium 4 were cancelled by Intel in favor of dual core processors, although some European retailers claimed to be selling a Pentium 4 580, clocked at 4?GHz.\\r\\nThe 5x0J series (and its low-end equivalent, the 5x5J and 5x9J series) introduced the XD Bit a.k.a. eXecute Disabled Bit[18] to Intel's line of processors. This technology, introduced to the x86 line by AMD and called NX (No eXecute), can help prevent certain types of malicious code from exploiting a buffer overflow to get executed. Intel also released a series of Prescott supporting Intel 64, Intel's implementation of the AMD-developed x86-64 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture. These were originally released as the F-series, and only sold to OEMs, but they were later renamed to the 5x1 series and sold to the general public. Two low-end Intel 64-enabled Prescotts, based on the 5x5/5x9 series, were also released with model numbers 506 and 516. 5x0, 5x0J, and 5x1 series Prescott incorporates Hyper-Threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software, such as video editing. The 5x1 series also supports 64 bit computing.\\r\\nIntel, by the first quarter of 2005, released a new Prescott core with 6x0 numbering, codenamed \\"Prescott 2M\\". Prescott 2M is also sometimes known by the name of its Xeon derivative, \\"Irwindale\\". It features Intel 64, the XD Bit, EIST (Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology), Tm2 (for processors at 3.6?GHz and above), and 2 MB of L2 cache. However, higher cache latency and the double word size, if using Intel 64 mode, negated any advantage that added cache introduced. Rather than being a targeted speed boost the double size cache was intended to provide the same space and hence performance for 64-bit mode operations.\\r\\n6xx series Prescott 2Ms have incorporated Hyper-Threading in order to speed up some processes that use multithreaded software, such as video editing.\\r\\nOn November 14, 2005, Intel released Prescott 2M processors with VT (Virtualization Technology, codenamed \\"Vanderpool\\") enabled. Intel only released two models of this Prescott 2M category: 662 and 672, running at 3.6?GHz and 3.8?GHz, respectively.\\r\\nThe final revision of the Pentium 4 was Cedar Mill, released on January 5, 2006. This was a die shrink of the Prescott-based 600 series core to 65 nm, with no real feature additions but significantly reduced power consumption. Cedar Mill had a lower heat output than Prescott, with a TDP of 86 W. The Core Stepping of D0 in late 2006 reduced this to 65 watts. It has a 65?nm core and features the same 31-stage pipeline as Prescott, 800?MT/s FSB, Intel 64, Hyper-Threading, but no Virtualization Technology. As with Prescott 2M, Cedar Mill also has a 2 MB L2 cache. It was released as Pentium 6x1 and 6x3 (product code 80552) at frequencies from 3?GHz up to 3.6?GHz. Overclockers managed to exceed 8?GHz with these processors using liquid nitrogen cooling.[19]\\r\\nTo distinguish Cedar Mill cores from Prescott cores with the same features, Intel added 1 to their model numbers. Thus, Pentium 4 631, 641, 651 and 661 are 65?nm Cedar Mill microprocessors, while Pentium 630, 640, 650 and 660 respectively are their 90?nm Prescott equivalents.\\r\\nThe name \\"Cedar Mill\\" refers to Cedar Mill, Oregon, an unincorporated community near Intel's Hillsboro, Oregon facilities.\\r\\nThe original successor to the Pentium 4 was (codenamed) Tejas, which was scheduled for an early-mid-2005 release. However, it was cancelled a few months after the release of Prescott due to extremely high TDPs (a 2.8?GHz Tejas emitted 150 W of heat, compared to around 80 W for a Northwood of the same speed, and 100 W for a comparably clocked Prescott) and development on the NetBurst microarchitecture as a whole ceased, with the exception of the dual-core Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition and the Cedar Mill-based Pentium 4 HT.\\r\\nSince May 2005, Intel has released dual-core processors based on the Pentium 4 under the names Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition. They represent Intel's shift towards parallelism and their intent was to eventually make the bulk of their main processor line multiple-core. These came under the code names Smithfield and Presler for the 90?nm and 65?nm parts respectively.\\r\\nThe ultimate successors to Pentium 4 are the Intel Core 2 processors using the \\"Conroe\\" core based upon the Core microarchitecture, released on July 27, 2006. Intel Core 2 processors have been released as single, dual and quad core processors. Single core counterparts are present in the Intel Core 2 line, primarily for the OEM market, while dual and quad core processors can be sold to retail and OEM.","input":"How many cores does a pentium 4 have?"},{"output":"Michael Earl Schoeffling","context":"Michael Earl Schoeffling (born December 10, 1960) is an American former actor and male model, known for playing Jake Ryan in Sixteen Candles, Kuch in Vision Quest, and Joe in Mermaids.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSchoeffling was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and raised in South Jersey.

Mud daubers belong to different families and are variable in appearance. Most resemble long, slender wasps about 1-inch (25?mm) in length.[1] The name refers to the nests that are made by the female wasps, which consist of mud molded into place by the wasp's mandibles. Mud daubers are not normally aggressive, but can become belligerent when threatened. Stings are uncommon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe organ pipe mud dauber, one of many mud daubers in the family Crabronidae, builds nests in the shape of a cylindrical tube resembling an organ pipe or pan flute. Common sites include vertical or horizontal faces of walls, cliffs, bridges, overhangs and shelter caves or other structures.\\r\\nThe nest of the black and yellow mud dauber is a simple, one-cell, urn-shaped nest that is attached to crevices, cracks and corners. Each nest contains one egg. Usually several nests are clumped together and covered in mud.\\r\\nThe metallic-blue mud dauber, another sphecid, builds typically horizontal oval nests, but occasionally refurbishes the abandoned nests of other species and preys primarily on black widow spiders.[2][not in citation given] Blue mud daubers sometimes appropriate old nests of black-and-yellow mud daubers. They carry water to them and recondition them for their own purposes. The two species commonly occupy the same barns, porches, or other nest sites.\\r\\nAll three species may occupy the same sites year after year, creating large numbers of nests. Mud dauber nests can last many years in protected locations and are often used as nest sites by other kinds of wasps and bees, as well as other types of insects.\\r\\nOne disadvantage to making nests is that most, if not all, of the nest-makers offspring are concentrated in one place, making them highly vulnerable to predation. Once a predator finds a nest, it can plunder it cell by cell. A variety of parasitic wasps, ranging from extremely tiny chalcidoid wasps to larger, bright green chrysidid wasps attack mud dauber nests. They pirate provisions and offspring as food for their own offspring.\\r\\nLike most other wasps, mud daubers are predators. The females not only build the nests, but also they hunt to provision them. However, pipe-organ mud dauber males have reportedly brought spiders to the nest, and they aid in nest guarding.\\r\\nBlack and yellow mud daubers primarily prey on relatively small, colorful spiders, such as crab spiders (and related groups), orb weavers and some jumping spiders. They usually find them in and around vegetation. Blue mud daubers are the main predator of the black and brown widow spiders.\\r\\nAdults of both sexes frequently drink flower nectar, but they stock their nests with spiders, which serve as food for their offspring. Like connoisseurs, they prefer particular kinds of spiders, and particular sizes of spiders for their larders. Instead of stocking a nest cell with one or two large spiders, mud daubers cram as many as two dozen small spiders into a nest cell. They appear to know exactly what they are hunting for, and where to find it.\\r\\nTo capture a spider, the wasp grabs it and stings it. The venom from the sting does not kill the spider, but paralyzes and preserves it so it can be transported and stored in the nest cell until consumed by the larva. A mud dauber usually lays its egg on the prey item and then seals it into the nest cell with a mud cap.[1] It then builds another cell or nest. Missouris mud daubers generally have two generations per year. The young survive the winter inside the nest.\\r\\nThere are many species of mud dauber wasp. Here are some characteristics for mud daubers of the Sceliphron genus.\\r\\nFace covered by dense golden hair; no yellow integumental patch on lower face.

The cause was determined to be due in part to a malfunctioning air speed indicator caused by mud dauber nests that were improperly cleared from the aircraft's pitot tubes.\\r\\nOn February 6, 1996, Birgenair Flight 301, a 757 jet flying from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean. All 13 crew members and 176 passengers were killed. A key part of the accident was a blocked pitot tube, a component which measures outside air pressure through small tubes on the outside of the aircraft and displays this as the plane's speed. Although the tubes were never recovered from the ocean floor, it was discovered that the plane had been sitting on the tarmac for almost 3 weeks with the pitot tubes not covered as they should have been. Investigators believe a black and yellow mud dauber got into the tube and built its cylindrical nest inside, causing faulty air speed readings that were a large part of the crash.\\r\\nOn April 10, 2015, about 1845 eastern daylight time, a Gulfstream Aerospace G-IV, N450KK, was substantially damaged during a cabin over-pressurization event over the Caribbean Sea while en route to Fort Lauderdale, Florida (FXE). An initial examination of the fuselage revealed that the outflow valve safety port, located on the outer fuselage, was completely plugged with a foreign material resembling dried dirt from a mud dauber.[4]","input":"What kind of bug makes a mud nest?"},{"output":"Philadelphia","context":"","input":"Which us city created the first formal us police department?"},{"output":"ruled by a series of archons or chief magistrates, and the Areopagus, made up of ex-archons","context":"","input":"What was the system before ancient greek democracy began?"},{"output":"Chandragupta","context":"The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive Iron Age historical power founded by Chandragupta Maurya which dominated ancient India between 322 BCE and 187 BCE. Extending into the kingdom of Magadha in the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the eastern side of the Indian subcontinent, the empire had its capital city at Pataliputra (modern Patna).[2][3] The empire was the largest to have ever existed in the Indian subcontinent, spanning over 5?million square kilometres (1.9?million square miles) at its zenith under Ashoka.\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya raised an army and with the assistance of Chanakya (also known as Kau?ilya),[4] overthrew the Nanda Empire in c.?322 BCE and rapidly expanded his power westwards across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions caused by the withdrawal westward of Alexander the Great's armies. By 317?BCE the empire had fully occupied Northwestern India, defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander.[5] Chandragupta then defeated the invasion led by Seleucus I, a Macedonian general from Alexander's army, gaining additional territory west of the Indus River.[6]\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire was one of the largest empires of the world in its time. At its greatest extent, the empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the Himalayas, to the east into Assam, to the west into Balochistan (southwest Pakistan and southeast Iran) and the Hindu Kush mountains of what is now Afghanistan.[7] The Empire was expanded into India's central and southern regions[8][9] by the emperors Chandragupta and Bindusara, but it excluded Kalinga (modern Odisha), until it was conquered by Ashoka.[10] It declined for about 50?years after Ashoka's rule ended, and it dissolved in 185?BCE with the foundation of the Shunga dynasty in Magadha.\\r\\nUnder Chandragupta Maurya and his successors, internal and external trade, agriculture, and economic activities all thrived and expanded across India thanks to the creation of a single and efficient system of finance, administration, and security. After the Kalinga War, the Empire experienced nearly half a century of peace and security under Ashoka. Mauryan India also enjoyed an era of social harmony, religious transformation, and expansion of the sciences and of knowledge. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka's embrace of Buddhism has been said to have been the foundation of the reign of social and political peace and non-violence across all of India. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist missionaries into Sri Lanka, Southeast Asia, West Asia, North Africa, and Mediterranean Europe.[11]\\r\\nThe population of the empire has been estimated to be about 50ÿ60 million, making the Mauryan Empire one of the most populous empires of Antiquity.[12][13] Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The Arthashastra[14] and the Edicts of Ashoka are the primary sources of written records of Mauryan times. The Lion Capital of Ashoka at Sarnath has been made the national emblem of India.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire was founded by Chandragupta Maurya, with help from Chanakya, at Takshashila. According to several legends, Chanakya travelled to Magadha, a kingdom that was large and militarily powerful and feared by its neighbors, but was insulted by its king Dhana Nanda, of the Nanda dynasty. Chanakya swore revenge and vowed to destroy the Nanda Empire.[15] Meanwhile, the conquering armies of Alexander the Great refused to cross the Beas River and advance further eastward, deterred by the prospect of battling Magadha. Alexander returned to Babylon and re-deployed most of his troops west of the Indus River. Soon after Alexander died in Babylon in 323?BCE, his empire fragmented into independent kingdoms led by his generals.[16]\\r\\nThe Greek generals Eudemus and Peithon ruled in the Indus Valley until around 317?BCE, when Chandragupta Maurya (with the help of Chanakya, who was now his advisor) orchestrated a rebellion to drive out the Greek governors, and subsequently brought the Indus Valley under the control of his new seat of power in Magadha.[5]\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya's rise to power is shrouded in mystery and controversy. On one hand, a number of ancient Indian accounts, such as the drama Mudrarakshasa (Poem of Rakshasa ÿ Rakshasa was the prime minister of Magadha) by Vishakhadatta, describe his royal ancestry and even link him with the Nanda family. A kshatriya clan known as the Maurya's are referred to in the earliest Buddhist texts, Mahaparinibbana Sutta. However, any conclusions are hard to make without further historical evidence. Chandragupta first emerges in Greek accounts as \\"Sandrokottos\\". As a young man he is said to have met Alexander.[17] He is also said to have met the Nanda king, angered him, and made a narrow escape.[18] Chanakya's original intentions were to train a guerilla army under Chandragupta's command.\\r\\nChanakya encouraged Chandragupta Maurya and his army to take over the throne of Magadha. Using his intelligence network, Chandragupta gathered many young men from across Magadha and other provinces, men upset over the corrupt and oppressive rule of king Dhana Nanda, plus the resources necessary for his army to fight a long series of battles. These men included the former general of Taxila, accomplished students of Chanakya, the representative of King Parvataka, his son Malayaketu, and the rulers of small states. The Macedonians (described as Yona or Yavana in Indian sources) may then have participated, together with other groups, in the armed uprising of Chandragupta Maurya against the Nanda dynasty. The Mudrarakshasa of Visakhadutta as well as the Jaina work Parisishtaparvan talk of Chandragupta's alliance with the Himalayan king Parvataka, often identified with Porus,[19][20] although this identification is not accepted by all historians.[21] This Himalayan alliance gave Chandragupta a composite and powerful army made up of Yavanas (Greeks), Kambojas, Shakas (Scythians), Kiratas (Himalayans), Parasikas (Persians) and Bahlikas (Bactrians) who took Pataliputra (also called Kusumapura, \\"The City of Flowers\\"):[22][23]\\r\\nPreparing to invade Pataliputra, Maurya came up with a strategy. A battle was announced and the Magadhan army was drawn from the city to a distant battlefield to engage with Maurya's forces. Maurya's general and spies meanwhile bribed the corrupt general of Nanda. He also managed to create an atmosphere of civil war in the kingdom, which culminated in the death of the heir to the throne. Chanakya managed to win over popular sentiment. Ultimately Nanda resigned, handing power to Chandragupta, and went into exile and was never heard of again. Chanakya contacted the prime minister, Rakshasas, and made him understand that his loyalty was to Magadha, not to the Nanda dynasty, insisting that he continue in office. Chanakya also reiterated that choosing to resist would start a war that would severely affect Magadha and destroy the city. Rakshasa accepted Chanakya's reasoning, and Chandragupta Maurya was legitimately installed as the new King of Magadha. Rakshasa became Chandragupta's chief advisor, and Chanakya assumed the position of an elder statesman.\\r\\nThe approximate extent of the Magadha state in the 5th century BCE.\\r\\nThe Maurya Empire when it was first founded by Chandragupta Maurya c. 320?BCE, after conquering the Nanda Empire when he was only about 20?years old.\\r\\nChandragupta extended the borders of the Maurya Empire towards Seleucid Persia after defeating Seleucus c. 305?BCE.[25]\\r\\nBindusara extended the borders of the empire southward into the Deccan Plateau c. 300?BCE.[26]\\r\\nAshoka extended into Kalinga during the Kalinga War c. 265?BCE, and established superiority over the southern kingdoms.\\r\\nHermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund believe that Ashoka's empire did not include large parts of India, which were controlled by autonomous tribes[27]\\r\\nChandragupta campaigned against the Macedonians when Seleucus I Nicator, in the process of creating the Seleucid Empire out of the eastern conquests of Alexander the Great, tried to reconquer the northwestern parts of India in 305?BCE. Seleucus failed (SeleucidÿMauryan war), the two rulers finally concluded a peace treaty: a marital treaty (Epigamia) was concluded, in which the Greeks offered their Princess for alliance and help from him. Chandragupta snatched the satrapies of Paropamisade (Kamboja and Gandhara), Arachosia (Kandhahar) and Gedrosia (Balochistan), and Seleucus I Nicator received 500 war elephants that were to have a decisive role in his victory against western Hellenistic kings at the Battle of Ipsus in 301?BCE. Diplomatic relations were established and several Greeks, such as the historian Megasthenes, Deimakos and Dionysius resided at the Mauryan court.\\r\\nChandragupta established a strong centralized state with an administration at Pataliputra, which, according to Megasthenes, was \\"surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by 64 gates and 570 towers\\". Aelian, although not expressly quoting Megasthenes nor mentionning Pataliputra, described Indian palaces as superior in splendor to Persia's Susa or Ectabana.[28] The architecture of the city seems to have had many similarities with Persian cities of the period.[29]\\r\\nChandragupta's son Bindusara extended the rule of the Mauryan empire towards southern India. The famous Tamil poet Mamulanar of the Sangam literature described how the Deccan Plateau was invaded by the Maurya army.[30] He also had a Greek ambassador at his court, named Megasthenes.[31]\\r\\nMegasthenes describes a disciplined multitude under Chandragupta, who live simply, honestly, and do not know writing:\\r\\nBindusara was the son of the first Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. During his reign, the empire expanded southwards. According to the Rajavalikatha, a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor small doses of poison with his food to build his immunity against possible assassination attempts by his enemies.[33] One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, who was 7?days away from delivery. The queen collapsed and died within few minutes. Chanakya entered the room at the very moment she collapsed, and, in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took the baby out. By that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head, due to which the child got a permanent blueish spot (a \\"bindu\\") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named \\"Bindusara\\".[34]\\r\\nBindusara, just 22?years?old, inherited a large empire that consisted of what is now, Northern, Central and Eastern parts of India along with parts of Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Bindusara extended this empire to the southern part of India, as far as what is now known as Karnataka. He brought sixteen states under the Mauryan Empire and thus conquered almost all of the Indian peninsula (he is said to have conquered the 'land between the two seas' ÿ the peninsular region between the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). Bindusara didn't conquer the friendly Tamil kingdoms of the Cholas, ruled by King Ilamcetcenni, the Pandyas, and Cheras. Apart from these southern states, Kalinga (modern Odisha) was the only kingdom in India that didn't form the part of Bindusara's empire. It was later conquered by his son Ashoka, who served as the viceroy of Ujjaini during his father's reign.[citation needed]\\r\\nBindusara's life has not been documented as well as that of his father Chandragupta or of his son Ashoka. Chanakya continued to serve as prime minister during his reign. According to the medieval Tibetan scholar Taranatha who visited India, Chanakya helped Bindusara \\"to destroy the nobles and kings of the sixteen kingdoms and thus to become absolute master of the territory between the eastern and western oceans.\\"[35] During his rule, the citizens of Taxila revolted twice. The reason for the first revolt was the maladministration of Susima, his eldest son. The reason for the second revolt is unknown, but Bindusara could not suppress it in his lifetime. It was crushed by Ashoka after Bindusara's death.[citation needed]\\r\\nAmbassadors from the Seleucid Empire (such as Deimachus) and Egypt visited his courts. He maintained good relations with the Hellenic World.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnlike his father Chandragupta (who at a later stage converted to Jainism), Bindusara believed in the Ajivika sect. Bindusara's guru Pingalavatsa (Janasana) was a Brahmin[36] of the Ajivika sect. Bindusara's wife, Queen Subhadrangi (Queen Aggamahesi) was a Brahmin[37] also of the Ajivika sect from Champa (present Bhagalpur district). Bindusara is credited with giving several grants to Brahmin monasteries (Brahmana-bhatto).[38]\\r\\nBindusara died in 272?BCE (some records say 268?BCE) and was succeeded by his son Ashoka.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a young prince, Ashoka (r.?272ÿ232?BCE) was a brilliant commander who crushed revolts in Ujjain and Takshashila. As monarch he was ambitious and aggressive, re-asserting the Empire's superiority in southern and western India. But it was his conquest of Kalinga (262ÿ261?BCE) which proved to be the pivotal event of his life. Although Ashoka's army succeeded in overwhelming Kalinga forces of royal soldiers and civilian units, an estimated 100,000 soldiers and civilians were killed in the furious warfare, including over 10,000 of Ashoka's own men. Hundreds of thousands of people were adversely affected by the destruction and fallout of war. When he personally witnessed the devastation, Ashoka began feeling remorse. Although the annexation of Kalinga was completed, Ashoka embraced the teachings of Buddhism, and renounced war and violence. He sent out missionaries to travel around Asia and spread Buddhism to other countries.[citation needed]\\r\\nAshoka implemented principles of ahimsa by banning hunting and violent sports activity and ending indentured and forced labor (many thousands of people in war-ravaged Kalinga had been forced into hard labour and servitude). While he maintained a large and powerful army, to keep the peace and maintain authority, Ashoka expanded friendly relations with states across Asia and Europe, and he sponsored Buddhist missions. He undertook a massive public works building campaign across the country. Over 40?years of peace, harmony and prosperity made Ashoka one of the most successful and famous monarchs in Indian history. He remains an idealized figure of inspiration in modern India.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, are found throughout the Subcontinent. Ranging from as far west as Afghanistan and as far south as Andhra (Nellore District), Ashoka's edicts state his policies and accomplishments. Although predominantly written in Prakrit, two of them were written in Greek, and one in both Greek and Aramaic. Ashoka's edicts refer to the Greeks, Kambojas, and Gandharas as peoples forming a frontier region of his empire. They also attest to Ashoka's having sent envoys to the Greek rulers in the West as far as the Mediterranean. The edicts precisely name each of the rulers of the Hellenic world at the time such as Amtiyoko (Antiochus), Tulamaya (Ptolemy), Amtikini (Antigonos), Maka (Magas) and Alikasudaro (Alexander) as recipients of Ashoka's proselytism.[citation needed] The Edicts also accurately locate their territory \\"600 yojanas away\\" (a yojanas being about 7?miles), corresponding to the distance between the center of India and Greece (roughly 4,000?miles).[39]\\r\\nAshoka was followed for 50?years by a succession of weaker kings. Brihadratha, the last ruler of the Mauryan dynasty, held territories that had shrunk considerably from the time of emperor Ashoka. Brihadratha was assassinated in 185?BCE during a military parade by the Brahmin general Pushyamitra Shunga, commander-in-chief of his guard, who then took over the throne and established the Shunga dynasty.[40]\\r\\nBuddhist records such as the Ashokavadana write that the assassination of Brihadratha and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of religious persecution for Buddhists,[41] and a resurgence of Hinduism. According to Sir John Marshall,[42] Pushyamitra may have been the main author of the persecutions, although later Shunga kings seem to have been more supportive of Buddhism. Other historians, such as Etienne Lamotte[43] and Romila Thapar,[44] among others, have argued that archaeological evidence in favour of the allegations of persecution of Buddhists are lacking, and that the extent and magnitude of the atrocities have been exaggerated.\\r\\nThe fall of the Mauryas left the Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign invasion followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180?BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was to establish a new capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, what is clear is that Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70?BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at Pataliputra. From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the east), Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the north). The head of the provincial administration was the Kumara (royal prince), who governed the provinces as king's representative. The kumara was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers. This organizational structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his Mantriparishad (Council of Ministers).[citation needed]\\r\\nHistorians theorise that the organisation of the Empire was in line with the extensive bureaucracy described by Kautilya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been one of the largest armies in the world during the Iron Age.[45] According to Megasthenes, the empire wielded a military of 600,000 infantry, 30,000 cavalry, 8,000 chariots and 9,000 war elephants besides followers and attendants.[46] A vast espionage system collected intelligence for both internal and external security purposes. Having renounced offensive warfare and expansionism, Ashoka nevertheless continued to maintain this large army, to protect the Empire and instil stability and peace across West and South Asia.[citation needed]\\r\\nFor the first time in South Asia, political unity and military security allowed for a common economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies, powerful regional chieftains, and internecine warfare, gave way to a disciplined central authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings, paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established a single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to new-found political unity and internal peace.[citation needed]\\r\\nUnder the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded. The Khyber Pass, on the modern boundary of Pakistan and Afghanistan, became a strategically important port of trade and intercourse with the outside world. Greek states and Hellenic kingdoms in West Asia became important trade partners of India. Trade also extended through the Malay peninsula into Southeast Asia. India's exports included silk goods and textiles, spices and exotic foods. The external world came across new scientific knowledge and technology with expanding trade with the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka also sponsored the construction of thousands of roads, waterways, canals, hospitals, rest-houses and other public works. The easing of many over-rigorous administrative practices, including those regarding taxation and crop collection, helped increase productivity and economic activity across the Empire.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn many ways, the economic situation in the Mauryan Empire is analogous to the Roman Empire of several centuries later. Both had extensive trade connections and both had organizations similar to corporations. While Rome had organizational entities which were largely used for public state-driven projects, Mauryan India had numerous private commercial entities. These existed purely for private commerce and developed before the Mauryan Empire itself.[47][unreliable source?]\\r\\nHoard of mostly Mauryan coins.\\r\\nSilver punch mark coin of the Maurya empire, with symbols of wheel and elephant. 3rd century BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nMauryan coin with arched hill symbol on reverse.[citation needed]\\r\\nMauryan Empire coin.

Ashoka initially practised Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the Kalinga War, he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the Arthashastra on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax collection and against rebels. Ashoka sent a mission led by his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta to Sri Lanka, whose king Tissa was so charmed with Buddhist ideals that he adopted them himself and made Buddhism the state religion. Ashoka sent many Buddhist missions to West Asia, Greece and South East Asia, and commissioned the construction of monasteries and schools, as well as the publication of Buddhist literature across the empire. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas across India, such as Sanchi and Mahabodhi Temple, and he increased the popularity of Buddhism in Afghanistan, Thailand and North Asia including Siberia. Ashoka helped convene the Third Buddhist Council of India's and South Asia's Buddhist orders near his capital, a council that undertook much work of reform and expansion of the Buddhist religion. Indian merchants embraced Buddhism and played a large role in spreading the religion across the Mauryan Empire.[49]\\r\\nChandragupta Maurya embraced Jainism after retiring, when he renounced his throne and material possessions to join a wandering group of Jain monks. Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk Bhadrabahu. It is said that in his last days, he observed the rigorous but self-purifying Jain ritual of santhara (fast unto death), at Shravana Belgola in Karnataka.[50][51][52][53] However, his successor, Bindusara, was a follower of another ascetic movement, jؐvika,[54] and distanced himself from Jain and Buddhist movements.[citation needed] Samprati, the grandson of Ashoka, also embraced Jainism. Samprati was influenced by the teachings of Jain monks and he is known to have built 125,000 derasars across India. Some of them are still found in the towns of Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Ujjain, and Palitana. It is also said that just like Ashoka, Samprati sent messengers and preachers to Greece, Persia and the Middle East for the spread of Jainism, but, to date, no research has been done in this area.[55][56]\\r\\nThus, Jainism became a vital force under the Mauryan Rule. Chandragupta and Samprati are credited for the spread of Jainism in South India. Hundreds of thousands of temples and stupas are said to have been erected during their reigns. However, due to lack of royal patronage, its own strict principles, and the rise of Shankaracharya and Ramanuja, Jainism, once a major religion of southern India, began to decline.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe greatest monument of this period, executed in the reign of Chandragupta Maurya, was the old palace at the site of Kumhrar. Excavations at the site of Kumhrar nearby have unearthed the remains of the palace. The palace is thought to have been an aggregate of buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about 7 meters high. According to the eyewitness account of Megasthenes, the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs.[57][better?source?needed] Kau?ilya's Arthashastra also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.[citation needed]\\r\\nDuring the Ashokan period, stonework was of a highly diversified order and comprised lofty free-standing pillars, railings of stupas, lion thrones and other colossal figures. The use of stone had reached such great perfection during this time that even small fragments of stone art were given a high lustrous polish resembling fine enamel. This period marked the beginning of the Buddhist school of architecture. Ashoka was responsible for the construction of several stupas, which were large domes and bearing symbols of Buddha. The most important ones are located at Sanchi, Bharhut, Amaravati, Bodhgaya and Nagarjunakonda. The most widespread examples of Mauryan architecture are the Ashoka pillars and carved edicts of Ashoka, often exquisitely decorated, with more than 40 spread throughout the Indian subcontinent.[58][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe peacock was a dynastic symbol of Mauryans, as depicted by Ashoka's pillars at Nandangarh and Sanchi Stupa.[59]\\r\\nRemains of the Ashokan Pillar in polished stone, to the right of the Southern Gateway.\\r\\nRemains of the shaft of the pillar of Ashoka, under a shed near the Southern Gateway.\\r\\nThe Sanchi pillar capital of Ashoka as discovered (left), and simulation of original appearance (right).[60] Flame palmettes and geese adorn the abacus.\\r\\nThe protection of animals in India became serious business by the time of the Maurya dynasty; being the first empire to provide a unified political entity in India, the attitude of the Mauryas towards forests, their denizens, and fauna in general is of interest.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mauryas firstly looked at forests as resources. For them, the most important forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these played a role in the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander's former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests.[61]\\r\\nOn the border of the forest, he should establish a forest for elephants guarded by foresters. The Office of the Chief Elephant Forester should with the help of guards protect the elephants in any terrain. The slaying of an elephant is punishable by death.\\r\\nThe Mauryas also designated separate forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers for skins. Elsewhere the Protector of Animals also worked to eliminate thieves, tigers and other predators to render the woods safe for grazing cattle.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mauryas valued certain forest tracts in strategic or economic terms and instituted curbs and control measures over them. They regarded all forest tribes with distrust and controlled them with bribery and political subjugation. They employed some of them, the food-gatherers or aranyaca to guard borders and trap animals. The sometimes tense and conflict-ridden relationship nevertheless enabled the Mauryas to guard their vast empire.[62]\\r\\nWhen Ashoka embraced Buddhism in the latter part of his reign, he brought about significant changes in his style of governance, which included providing protection to fauna, and even relinquished the royal hunt. He was the first ruler in history[not in citation given] to advocate conservation measures for wildlife and even had rules inscribed in stone edicts. The edicts proclaim that many followed the king's example in giving up the slaughter of animals; one of them proudly states:[62]\\r\\nOur king killed very few animals.\\r\\nHowever, the edicts of Ashoka reflect more the desire of rulers than actual events; the mention of a 100 'panas' (coins) fine for poaching deer in royal hunting preserves shows that rule-breakers did exist. The legal restrictions conflicted with the practices freely exercised by the common people in hunting, felling, fishing and setting fires in forests.[62]\\r\\nRelations with the Hellenistic world may have started from the very beginning of the Maurya Empire. Plutarch reports that Chandragupta Maurya met with Alexander the Great, probably around Taxila in the northwest:\\r\\nChandragupta ultimately occupied Northwestern India, in the territories formerly ruled by the Greeks, where he fought the satraps (described as \\"Prefects\\" in Western sources) left in place after Alexander (Justin), among whom may have been Eudemus, ruler in the western Punjab until his departure in 317?BCE or Peithon, son of Agenor, ruler of the Greek colonies along the Indus until his departure for Babylon in 316?BCE.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeleucus I Nicator, the Macedonian satrap of the Asian portion of Alexander's former empire, conquered and put under his own authority eastern territories as far as Bactria and the Indus (Appian, History of Rome, The Syrian Wars 55), until in 305?BCE he entered into a confrontation with Emperor Chandragupta:\\r\\nThough no accounts of the conflict remain, it is clear that Seleucus fared poorly against the Indian Emperor as he failed to conquer any territory, and in fact was forced to surrender much that was already his. Regardless, Seleucus and Chandragupta ultimately reached a settlement and through a treaty sealed in 305?BCE, Seleucus, according to Strabo, ceded a number of territories to Chandragupta, including large parts of what is now Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is generally thought that Chandragupta married Seleucus's daughter, or a Greek Macedonian princess, a gift from Seleucus to formalise an alliance. In a return gesture, Chandragupta sent 500 war elephants,[25][67][68][69][70] a military asset which would play a decisive role at the Battle of Ipsus in 301?BCE.[71] In addition to this treaty, Seleucus dispatched an ambassador, Megasthenes, to Chandragupta, and later Deimakos to his son Bindusara, at the Mauryan court at Pataliputra (modern Patna in Bihar state). Later, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Ptolemaic Egypt and contemporary of Ashoka, is also recorded by Pliny the Elder as having sent an ambassador named Dionysius to the Mauryan court.[72][better?source?needed]\\r\\nMainstream scholarship asserts that Chandragupta received vast territory west of the Indus, including the Hindu Kush, modern-day Afghanistan, and the Balochistan province of Pakistan.[73][74] Archaeologically, concrete indications of Mauryan rule, such as the inscriptions of the Edicts of Ashoka, are known as far as Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.\\r\\nThe treaty on \\"Epigamia\\" implies lawful marriage between Greeks and Indians was recognized at the State level, although it is unclear whether it occurred among dynastic rulers or common people, or both.[citation needed].\\r\\nClassical sources have also recorded that following their treaty, Chandragupta and Seleucus exchanged presents, such as when Chandragupta sent various aphrodisiacs to Seleucus:[75]\\r\\nHis son Bindusara 'Amitraghata' (Slayer of Enemies) also is recorded in Classical sources as having exchanged presents with Antiochus I:[75]\\r\\nThe Greek population apparently remained in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent under Ashoka's rule. In his Edicts of Ashoka, set in stone, some of them written in Greek, Ashoka relates that the Greek population within his realm was absorbed, integrated, and converted to Buddhism:\\r\\nFragments of Edict 13 have been found in Greek, and a full Edict, written in both Greek and Aramaic, has been discovered in Kandahar. It is said to be written in excellent Classical Greek, using sophisticated philosophical terms. In this Edict, Ashoka uses the word Eusebeia (\\"Piety\\") as the Greek translation for the ubiquitous \\"Dharma\\" of his other Edicts written in Prakrit:[non-primary source needed]\\r\\nAlso, in the Edicts of Ashoka, Ashoka mentions the Hellenistic kings of the period as recipients of his Buddhist proselytism, although no Western historical record of this event remains:\\r\\nAshoka also encouraged the development of herbal medicine, for men and animals, in their territories:\\r\\nThe Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as Dharmaraksita, are described in Pali sources as leading Greek (\\"Yona\\") Buddhist monks, active in Buddhist proselytism (the Mahavamsa, XII[79][non-primary source needed]).\\r\\nSophagasenus was an Indian Mauryan ruler of the 3rd century BCE, described in ancient Greek sources, and named Subhagasena or Subhashasena in Prakrit. His name is mentioned in the list of Mauryan princes[citation needed], and also in the list of the Yadava dynasty, as a descendant of Pradyumna. He may have been a grandson of Ashoka, or Kunala, the son of Ashoka. He ruled an area south of the Hindu Kush, possibly in Gandhara. Antiochos III, the Seleucid king, after having made peace with Euthydemus in Bactria, went to India in 206?BCE and is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there:\\r\\n\\"He (Antiochus) crossed the Caucasus and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him\\".

The Pont du Gard is the highest of all elevated Roman aqueducts, and, along with the Aqueduct of Segovia, one of the best preserved. It was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 because of its historical importance.\\r\\nThe aqueduct bridge is part of the N?mes aqueduct, a 50-kilometre (31?mi) system built in the first century AD to carry water from a spring at Uzs to the Roman colony of Nemausus (N?mes).[4] Because of the uneven terrain between the two points, the mostly underground aqueduct followed a long, winding route that called for a bridge across the gorge of the Gardon River.\\r\\nThe bridge has three tiers of arches, stands 48.8?m (160?ft) high, and descends a mere 2.5 centimetres (1?in)?ÿ a gradient of only 1 in 18,241?ÿ while the whole aqueduct descends in height by only 12.6?m (41?ft) over its entire length, which is indicative of the great precision that Roman engineers were able to achieve, using simple technology. The aqueduct formerly carried an estimated 40,000?m3 (8,800,000?imp?gal) of water a day to the fountains, baths and homes of the citizens of N?mes. It may have been in use as late as the 6th century, with some parts used for significantly longer, but a lack of maintenance after the 4th century led to clogging by mineral deposits and debris that eventually choked off the flow of water.\\r\\nAfter the Roman Empire collapsed and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, due to the importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.\\r\\nIt underwent a series of renovations between the 18th and 21st centuries, commissioned by the local authorities and the French state, that culminated in 2000 with the opening of a new visitor centre and the removal of traffic and buildings from the bridge and the area immediately around it. Today it is one of France's most popular tourist attractions, and has attracted the attention of a succession of literary and artistic visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of Nemausus (N?mes) was somewhat inconvenient when it came to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. The only real alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzs), where there are natural springs.[5]\\r\\nThe N?mes aqueduct was built to channel water from the springs of the Fontaine d'Eure near Uzs to the castellum divisorum (repartition basin) in Nemausus. From there, it was distributed to fountains, baths and private homes around the city. The straight-line distance between the two is only about 20?km (12?mi) but the aqueduct takes a winding route measuring around 50?km (31?mi).[6] This was necessary to circumvent the southernmost foothills of the Massif Central, known as the Garrigues de N?mes. They are difficult to cross, as they are covered in dense vegetation and garrigue and indented by deep valleys.[7] It was impractical for the Romans to attempt to tunnel through the hills, as it would have required a tunnel of between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6?mi), depending on the starting point. A roughly V-shaped course around the eastern end of the Garrigues de N?mes was therefore the only practical way of transporting the water from the spring to the city.\\r\\nThe Fontaine d'Eure, at 76?m (249?ft) above sea level, is only 17?m (56?ft) higher than the repartition basin in N?mes, but this provided a sufficient gradient to sustain a steady flow of water to the 50,000 inhabitants of the Roman city. The aqueduct's average gradient is only 1 in 3,000. It varies widely along its course, but is as little as 1 in 20,000 in some sections. The Pont du Gard itself descends 2.5?cm (0.98?in) in 456?m (1,496?ft), a gradient of 1 in 18,241.[8] The average gradient between the start and end of the aqueduct is far shallower than was usual for Roman aqueducts ÿ only about a tenth of the average gradient of some of the aqueducts in Rome.[9]\\r\\nThe reason for the disparity in gradients along the aqueduct's route is that a uniform gradient would have meant that the Pont du Gard would have been infeasibly high, given the limitations of the technology of the time. By varying the gradient along the route, the aqueduct's engineers were able to lower the height of the bridge by 6 metres (20?ft) to 48.77 metres (160.0?ft) above the river ÿ still exceptionally high by Roman standards, but within acceptable limits. This height limit governed the profile and gradients of the entire aqueduct, but it came at the price of creating a \\"sag\\" in the middle of the aqueduct. The gradient profile before the Pont du Gard is relatively steep, descending at 0.67 metres (2?ft 2?in) per kilometre, but thereafter it descends by only 6 metres (20?ft) over the remaining 25 kilometres (16?mi). In one section, the winding route between the Pont du Gard and St Bonnet required an extraordinary degree of accuracy from the Roman engineers, who had to allow for a fall of only 7 millimetres (0.28?in) per 100 metres (330?ft) of the conduit.[10]\\r\\nIt is estimated that the aqueduct supplied the city with around 40,000 cubic metres (8,800,000?imp?gal) of water a day[11] that took nearly 27 hours to flow from the source to the city.[12] The water arrived in the castellum divisorum at N?mes ÿ an open, shallow, circular basin 5.5 m in diameter by 1 m deep. It would have been surrounded by a balustrade within some sort of enclosure, probably under some kind of small but elaborate pavilion. When it was excavated, traces of a tiled roof, Corinthian columns and a fresco decorated with fish and dolphins were discovered in a fragmentary condition.[13] The aqueduct water entered through an opening 1.2 metres (3?ft 11?in) wide, and ten large holes in the facing wall, each 40 centimetres (16?in) wide, directed the water into the city's main water pipes. Three large drains were also located in the floor, possibly to enable the nearby amphitheatre to be flooded rapidly to enable naumachia (mock naval battles) to be held.[14]\\r\\nThe spring still exists and is now the site of a small modern pumping station. Its water is pure but high in dissolved calcium carbonate leached out of the surrounding limestone. This presented the Romans with significant problems in maintaining the aqueduct, as the carbonates precipitated out of the water during its journey through the conduit. This caused the flow of the aqueduct to become progressively reduced by deposits of calcareous sinter.[15] Another threat was posed by vegetation penetrating the stone lid of the channel. As well as obstructing the flow of the water, dangling roots introduced algae and bacteria that decomposed in a process called biolithogenesis, producing concretions within the conduit. It required constant maintenance by circitores, workers responsible for the aqueduct's upkeep, who crawled along the conduit scrubbing the walls clean and removing any vegetation.[16]\\r\\nMuch of the N?mes aqueduct was built underground, as was typical of Roman aqueducts. It was constructed by digging a trench in which a stone channel was built and enclosed by an arched roof of stone slabs, which was then covered with earth. Some sections of the channel are tunnelled through solid rock. In all, 35?km (22?mi) of the aqueduct was constructed below the ground.[17] The remainder had to be carried on the surface through conduits set on a wall or on arched bridges. Some substantial remains of the above-ground works can still be seen today, such as the so-called \\"Pont Rue\\" that stretches for hundreds of metres around Vers and still stands up to 7.5?m (25?ft) high.[18] Other surviving parts include the Pont de Borngre, three arches carrying the aqueduct 17?m (56?ft) across a stream; the Pont de Sartanette, near the Pont du Gard, which covers 32?m (105?ft) across a small valley; and three sections of aqueduct tunnel near Sernhac, measuring up to 66?m (217?ft) long.[19] However, the Pont du Gard is by far the best preserved section of the entire aqueduct.\\r\\nBuilt on three levels, the Pont is 49?m (161?ft) high above the river at low water and 274?m (899?ft) long. Its width varies from 9?m (30?ft) at the bottom to 3?m (9.8?ft) at the top.[21] The three levels of arches are recessed, with the main piers in line one above another. The span of the arches varies slightly, as each was constructed independently to provide flexibility to protect against subsidence. Each level has a differing number of arches:[20][22]\\r\\nThe first level of the Pont du Gard adjoins a road bridge that was added in the 18th century. The water conduit or specus, which is about 1.8?m (6?ft) high and 1.2?m (4?ft) wide, is carried at the top of the third level. The upper levels of the bridge are slightly curved in the upstream direction. It was long believed that the engineers had designed it this way deliberately to strengthen the bridge's structure against the flow of water, like a dam wall. However, a microtopographic survey carried out in 1989 showed that the bend is caused by the stone expanding and contracting by about 5?mm (0.20?in) a day under the heat of the sun. Over the centuries, this process has produced the current deformation.[23]\\r\\nThe Pont du Gard was constructed largely without the use of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some 21,000?m3 (740,000?cu?ft); some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons.[24] Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately 700 metres (2,300?ft) downstream, on the banks of the Gardon River.[25][26] The coarse-grained soft reddish shelly limestone, known locally as \\"Pierre de Vers\\", lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to fit perfectly together by friction alone, eliminating the need for mortar.[11] The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as fronte dextra or fronte sinistra (front right or front left), to guide the builders.[27]\\r\\nThe method of construction is fairly well understood by historians.[28][29][30] The patron of the aqueduct?ÿ a rich individual or the city of N?mes itself?ÿ would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, and a set of measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.[31]\\r\\nThe builders would have made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work could have been done using simple sheers operated by a windlass. For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century.[31] A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction.[22] The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; mile Esprandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces,[31][32] equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.[19]\\r\\nAlthough the exterior of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.[33]\\r\\nAlthough the Pont du Gard is renowned for its appearance, its design is not optimal as the technique of stacking arches on top of each other is clumsy and inefficient (and therefore expensive) in the amount of materials it requires. Later aqueducts had a more sophisticated design, making greater use of concrete to reduce their volume and cost of construction. The Aqueduct bridge of Segovia and the Pont de les Ferreres are of roughly similar length but use far fewer arches. Roman architects were eventually able to do away with \\"stacking\\" altogether. The Acueducto de los Milagros in Mrida, Spain and the Chabet Ilelouine aqueduct bridge, near Cherchell, Algeria [34] utilise tall, slender piers, constructed from top to bottom with concrete-faced masonry and brick.[35]\\r\\nThe construction of the aqueduct has long been credited to the Roman emperor Augustus' son-in-law and aide, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, around the year 19 BC. At the time, he was serving as aedile, the senior magistrate responsible for managing the water supply of Rome and its colonies. Esprandieu, writing in 1926, linked the construction of the aqueduct with Agrippa's visit to Narbonensis in that year.[7] Newer excavations suggest the construction may have taken place between 40 and 60 AD. Tunnels dating from the time of Augustus had to be bypassed by the builders of the N?mes aqueduct, and coins discovered in the outflow in N?mes are no older than the reign of the emperor Claudius (41ÿ54 AD). On this basis, a team led by Guilhem Fabre has argued that the aqueduct must have been completed around the middle of the 1st century AD.[36] It is believed to have taken about fifteen years to build, employing between 800 and 1,000 workers.[37]\\r\\nFrom the 4th century onwards, the aqueduct's maintenance was neglected as successive waves of invaders disrupted the region.[33] It became clogged with debris, encrustations and plant roots, greatly reducing the flow of the water. The resulting deposits in the conduit, consisting of layers of dirt and organic material, are up to 50?cm (20?in) thick on each wall.[38] An analysis of the deposits originally suggested that it had continued to supply water to N?mes until as late as the 9th century,[39] but more recent investigations suggest that it had gone out of use by about the sixth century, though parts of it may have continued to be used for significantly longer.[40]\\r\\nAlthough some of its stones were plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzs the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzs. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair.[39] However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had one side of the second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.[41]\\r\\nIn 1703 the local authorities renovated the Pont du Gard to repair cracks, fill in ruts and replace the stones lost in the previous century. A new bridge was built by the engineer Henri Pitot in 1743ÿ47 next to the arches of the lower level, so that the road traffic could cross on a purpose-built bridge.[11][41] The novelist Alexandre Dumas was strongly critical of the construction of the new bridge, commenting that \\"it was reserved for the eighteenth century to dishonour a monument which the barbarians of the fifth had not dared to destroy.\\"[42] The Pont du Gard continued to deteriorate and by the time Prosper Mrime saw it in 1835 it was at serious risk of collapse from erosion and the loss of stonework.[43]\\r\\nNapoleon III, who had a great admiration for all things Roman, visited the Pont du Gard in 1850 and took a close interest in it. He approved plans by the architect Charles Laisn to repair the bridge in a project which was carried out between 1855ÿ58, with funding provided by the Ministry of State. The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers with concrete to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct. Stairs were installed at one end and the conduit walls were repaired, allowing visitors to walk along the conduit itself in reasonable safety.[43]\\r\\nThere have been a number of subsequent projects to consolidate the piers and arches of the Pont du Gard. It has survived three serious floods over the last century; in 1958 the whole of the lower tier was submerged by a giant flood that washed away other bridges,[43] and in 1998 another major flood affected the area. A further flood struck in 2002, badly damaging nearby installations.\\r\\nThe Pont du Gard was added to UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 on the criteria of \\"Human creative genius; testimony to cultural tradition; significance to human history\\".[44] The description on the list states: \\"The hydraulic engineers and?... architects who conceived this bridge created a technical as well as artistic masterpiece.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe Pont du Gard has been a tourist attraction for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an obligatory stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), many of whom have left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.[45]\\r\\nThe bridge has had a long association with French monarchs seeking to associate themselves with a symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzs. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits.[42] A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to N?mes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees.[46] In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past.[47] Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.[48]\\r\\nBy the 1990s the Pont du Gard had become a hugely popular tourist attraction but was congested with traffic?ÿ vehicles were still allowed to drive over the 1743 road bridge?ÿ and was cluttered with illegally built structures and tourist shops lining the river banks. As the architect Jean-Paul Viguier put it, the \\"appetite for gain\\" had transformed the Pont du Gard into \\"a fairground attraction\\".[49] In 1996 the General Council of the Gard dpartement began a major four-year project to improve the area, sponsored by the French government, in conjunction with local sources, UNESCO and the EU. The entire area around the bridge was pedestrianised and a new visitor centre was built on the north bank to a design by Jean-Paul Viguier. The redevelopment has ensured that the area around the Pont du Gard is now much quieter due to the removal of vehicle traffic, and the new museum provides a much improved historical context for visitors.[50] The Pont du Gard is today one of France's top five tourist attractions, with 1.4 million visitors reported in 2001.[51]\\r\\nSince it became a tourist destination, many novelists and writers have visited the Pont du Gard and written of the experience. Jean-Jacques Rousseau was overwhelmed when he first visited it in 1738: [52]\\r\\nI had been told to go and see the Pont du Gard; I did not fail to do so. It was the first work of the Romans that I had seen. I expected to see a monument worthy of the hands which had constructed it. This time the object surpassed my expectation, for the only time in my life. Only the Romans could have produced such an effect. The sight of this simple and noble work struck me all the more since it is in the middle of a wilderness where silence and solitude render the object more striking and the admiration more lively; for this so-called bridge was only an aqueduct. One asks oneself what force has transported these enormous stones so far from any quarry, and what brought together the arms of so many thousands of men in a place where none of them live. I wandered about the three storeys of this superb edifice although my respect for it almost kept me from daring to trample it underfoot. The echo of my footsteps under these immense vaults made me imagine that I heard the strong voices of those who had built them. I felt myself lost like an insect in that immensity. While making myself small, I felt an indefinable something that raised up my soul, and I said to myself with a sigh, \\"Why was I not born a Roman!\\"[53]\\r\\nThe novelist Henry James, visiting in 1884, was similarly impressed; he described the Pont du Gard as \\"unspeakably imposing, and nothing could well be more Roman.\\" He commented:\\r\\nThe hugeness, the solidity, the unexpectedness, the monumental rectitude of the whole thing leave you nothing to say?ÿ at the time?ÿ and make you stand gazing. You simply feel that it is noble and perfect, that it has the quality of greatness?... When the vague twilight began to gather, the lonely valley seemed to fill itself with the shadow of the Roman name, as if the mighty empire were still as erect as the supports of the aqueduct; and it was open to a solitary tourist, sitting there sentimental, to believe that no people has ever been, or will ever be, as great as that, measured, as we measure the greatness of an individual, by the push they gave to what they undertook. The Pont du Gard is one of the three or four deepest impressions they have left; it speaks of them in a manner with which they might have been satisfied.[54]\\r\\nThe mid-19th-century writer Joseph Mry wrote in his 1853 book Les Nuits italiennes, contes nocturnes that on seeing the Pont du Gard:\\r\\n[O]ne is struck dumb with astonishment; you are walking in a desert where nothing reminds you of man; cultivation has disappeared; there are ravines, heaths, blocks of rock, clusters of rushes, oaks, massed together, a stream which flows by a melancholy strand, wild mountains, a silence like that of Thebaid, and in the midst of this landscape springs up the most magnificent object that civilization has created for the glory of the fine arts.[55]\\r\\nHilaire Belloc wrote in 1928 that:\\r\\n[W]hen one sees the thing all that is said of it comes true. Its isolation, its dignity, its weight, are all three awful. It looks as though it had been built long before all record by beings greater than ourselves, and were intended to stand long after the dissolution of our petty race. One can repose in it. I confess to a great reluctance to praise what has been praised too much; but so it is. A man, suffering from the unrest of our time, might do worse than camp out for three days, fishing and bathing under the shadow of the Pont du Gard.[56]","input":"Where is the pont du gard aqueduct located?"},{"output":"October 20, 1999","context":"One Piece is an anime series adapted from the manga of the same title written by Eiichiro Oda.

Luffy's greatest ambition is to obtain the world's ultimate treasure, One Piece, and thereby become the next King of the Pirates.[1]\\r\\nThe series uses 37 different pieces of theme music: 19 opening themes and 18 closing themes. Several CDs that contain the theme music and other tracks have been released by Toei Animation. The first DVD compilation was released on February 21, 2001,[2] with individual volumes releasing monthly. The Singaporean company Odex released part of the series locally in English and Japanese in the form of dual audio video CDs.[3]\\r\\nIn 2004, 4Kids Entertainment licensed the first five seasons for an English-language broadcast in North America. This dub was heavily edited for content, as well as length, reducing the first 143 episodes to 104, and thus receiving large amounts of controversy and fan backlash.[4] One Piece made its U.S. premiere on September 18, 2004, on the Fox network's Fox Box programming block, and also began airing on the Cartoon Network's Toonami block in April 2005. In December 2006, 4Kids cancelled production due to financial reasons.[5]\\r\\nIn April 2007, Funimation Entertainment acquired the license of One Piece from 4Kids and would use their in-house voice cast in preparation for the series' DVD releases.[6] Beginning with the sixth season, the Funimation dubbed episodes aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from September 2007 until the block's cancellation in March 2008.[7] In Australia, Cartoon Network resumed airing new One Piece episodes in November 2008, starting with episode 170,[8] lasting until January 2009 following episode 195.[8] The first unedited, bilingual DVD box set, containing 13 episodes, was released on May 27, 2008.[9] Similarly sized sets followed with 31 sets released as of July 2015.[10][11] Episodes had begun streaming since August 29, 2009.[12] Funimation's uncut dub later resumed airing on Adult Swim's revived Toonami block from episode 207 onwards from May 18, 2013.[13]\\r\\nOn March 10, 2017, it was announced on Toonami Pre-Flight that One Piece would be removed from the block after March 18.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting in Season 6, 4Kids dropped One Piece and the rights were picked up by FUNimation.

Its primary purpose is to provide evidence about a suspicious or questionable document using scientific processes and methods. Evidence might include alterations, the chain of possession, damage to the document, forgery, origin, authenticity, or other questions that come up when a document is challenged in court.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany QD examinations involve a comparison of the questioned document, or components of the document, to a set of known standards. The most common type of examination involves handwriting wherein the examiner tries to address concerns about potential authorship.\\r\\nA document examiner is often asked to determine if a questioned item originated from the same source as the known item(s), then present their opinion on the matter in court as an expert witness. Other common tasks include determining what has happened to a document, determining when a document was produced, or deciphering information on the document that has been obscured, obliterated, or erased.\\r\\nThe discipline is known by many names including 'forensic document examination', 'document examination', 'diplomatics', 'handwriting examination', or sometimes 'handwriting analysis', although the latter term is not often used as it may be confused with graphology. Likewise a forensic document examiner (FDE) is not to be confused with a graphologist, and vice versa.\\r\\nMany FDEs receive extensive training in all of the aspects of the discipline. As a result, they are competent to address a wide variety of questions about document evidence. However, this \\"broad specialization\\" approach has not been universally adopted.\\r\\nIn some locales, a clear distinction is made between the terms 'forensic document examiner' and a 'forensic handwriting expert/examiner'. In such cases, the former term refers to examiners who focus on non-handwriting examination types while the latter refers to those trained exclusively to do handwriting examinations. Even in places where the more general meaning is common, such as North America or Australia, there are many individuals who have specialized training only in relatively limited areas. As the terminology varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, it is important to clarify the meaning of the title used by any individual professing to be a \\"forensic document examiner\\".\\r\\nA forensic document examiner is intimately linked to the legal system as a forensic scientist. Forensic science is the application of science to address issues under consideration in the legal system. FDEs examine items (documents) that form part of a case that may or may not come before a court of law.\\r\\nCommon criminal charges involved in a document examination case fall into the \\"white-collar crime\\" category. These include identity theft, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, or uttering a forged document. Questioned documents are often important in other contexts simply because documents are used in so many contexts and for so many purposes. For example, a person may commit murder and forge a suicide note. This is an example where a document is produced directly as a fundamental part of a crime. More often a questioned document is simply the by-product of normal day-to-day business or personal activities.\\r\\nThe American Society for Testing and Materials, International (ASTM) publishes standards for many methods and procedures used by FDEs. E30.02 was the ASTM subcomittee for Questioned Documents. These guides were under the jurisdiction of ASTM Committee E30 on Forensic Sciences and the direct responsibility of Subcommittee E30.02 on Questioned Documents. The ASTM Questioned Document Section has been disbanded.\\r\\nAll of the Standards are now available through SWGDOC (The Scientific Working Group for Document Examiners). The Standard Guide for Scope of Work of Forensic Document Examiners indicates there are four components to the work of a forensic document examiner. It states that an examiner \\"makes scientific examinations, comparisons, and analyses of documents to:\\r\\nSome FDEs limit their work to the examination and comparison of handwriting; most inspect and examine the whole document in accordance with this ASTM standard.\\r\\nDocuments feature prominently in all manner of business and personal affairs. Almost any type of document may become disputed in an investigation or litigation. For example, a questioned document may be a sheet of paper bearing handwriting or mechanically-produced text such as a ransom note, a forged cheque, or a business contract. It may be material not normally thought of as a 'document'. FDEs define the word \\"document\\" in a very broad sense as being any material bearing marks, signs, or symbols intended to convey a message or meaning to someone. This encompasses traditional paper documents but also includes things like graffiti on a wall, stamp impressions on meat products, or covert markings hidden in a written letter, among others.\\r\\nAlthough the crimes were committed before the discipline of document examination was firmly established, the letters of the Jack the Ripper case have since been examined in great detail.\\r\\nA person who desires to enter a career of forensic document examination must possess certain traits and abilities. The ASTM Standard E2388-05[1] (Standard Guide for Minimum Training Requirements for Forensic Document Examiners) lists several requirements for the \\"Trainee Candidate\\".\\r\\nFirst and foremost, \\"an earned baccalaureate degree or equivalent from an accredited college or university\\" is required as it gives the aspirant a scientific background with which to approach the work in an objective manner, as well as bestowing necessary biological, physical, and chemical knowledge sometimes called upon in the work.\\r\\nSecond, excellent eyesight is required to see fine details that are otherwise inconspicuous. To this end, the aspirant must successfully complete:\\r\\nBeyond the above, additional desirable skills include knowledge of paper, ink, printing processes, or handwriting.\\r\\nThere are three possible methods of instruction for an aspiring document examiner:\\r\\nThere are some distance learning courses available as well. These are taught through a virtual reality classroom and may include an apprenticeship program, a correspondence course, or both.\\r\\nA trainee must learn how to present evidence before the court in clear, forceful testimony. Fledgling examiners in the later stages of training can get a glimpse into the legal process as well as a better sense of this aspect of their work through participation in a mock trial or by attending court hearings to observe the testimony of qualified examiners. These are guidelines and not requirements.\\r\\nExaminations and comparisons conducted by document examiners can be diverse and may involve any of the following:\\r\\nThe concept of 'identification' as it is applied in the forensic sciences is open to discussion and debate.[2] Nonetheless, the traditional approach in the discipline of forensic document examination is best expressed as follows:\\r\\n\\"When any two items possess a combination of independent discriminating elements (characteristics) that are similar and/or correspond in their relationships to one another, of such number and significance as to preclude the possibility of their occurrence by pure coincidence, and there are no inexplicable disparities, it may be concluded that they are the same in nature or are related to a common source (the principle of identification).\\"[3]\\r\\nThe evaluation of such characteristics is now predominantly subjective though efforts to meaningfully quantify this type of information are ongoing. Subjective evaluation does not mean that the results of properly conducted comparisons will be unreliable or inaccurate. To the contrary, scientific testing has shown that professional document examiners (as a group) out-perform lay-people when comparing handwriting or signatures to assess authorship.[4]\\r\\nHowever, this type of 'subjective' analysis depends greatly upon the competency of an individual examiner.\\r\\nIt follows that\\r\\nThe examination of handwriting to assess potential authorship proceeds from the above principle of identification by applying it to a comparison of samples of handwritten material. Generally, there are three stages in the process of examination.[5] In brief, they are:\\r\\nASTM has published a standard guide for the examination of handwriting titled \\"E2290-07a: Examination of Handwritten Items\\".[1] Some of the guides listed under \\"Other Examinations\\" apply to forensic handwriting comparisons (e.g., E444 or E1658).\\r\\nAn alternative guide for the examination of handwriting and signatures has been developed by the Forensic Expertise Profiling Laboratory (School of Human Biosciences, La Trobe University, Victoria, Australia).\\r\\nAside from E2290 mentioned above, many standard guides pertaining to the examination of questioned documents have been published by ASTM International.[1] They include the following:\\r\\nNot all laboratories or examiners use or follow ASTM guidelines.

It can most specifically mean the first five books (Pentateuch) of the 24 books of the Tanakh, and is usually printed with the rabbinic commentaries (perushim). It can mean the continued narrative from the Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice, whether derived from biblical texts or later rabbinic writings.[1] Common to all these meanings, Torah consists of the origin of Jewish peoplehood: their call into being by God, their trials and tribulations, and their covenant with their God, which involves following a way of life embodied in a set of moral and religious obligations and civil laws (halakha).\\r\\nIn rabbinic literature the word \\"Torah\\" denotes both the five books (Hebrew: ???? ?????? \\"Torah that is written\\") and the Oral Torah (???? ???? ??, \\"Torah that is spoken\\"). The Oral Torah consists of interpretations and amplifications which according to rabbinic tradition have been handed down from generation to generation and are now embodied in the Talmud and Midrash.[2] According to rabbinic tradition, all of the teachings found in the Torah, both written and oral, were given by God through the prophet Moses, some at Mount Sinai and others at the Tabernacle, and all the teachings were written down by Moses, which resulted in the Torah that exists today. According to the Midrash, the Torah was created prior to the creation of the world, and was used as the blueprint for Creation.[3] The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the written books were a product of the Babylonian captivity (c. 600?BCE), based on earlier written and oral traditions, which could only have arisen from separate communities within ancient Israel,[citation needed] and that it was completed by the period of Achaemenid rule (c. 400?BCE).[4][5]\\r\\nTraditionally, the words of the Torah are written on a scroll by a scribe (sofer) in Hebrew. A Torah portion is read publicly at least once every three days in the presence of a congregation.[6] Reading the Torah publicly is one of the bases for Jewish communal life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"Torah\\" in Hebrew is derived from the root ???, which in the hif'il conjugation means \\"to guide/teach\\" (cf. Lev 10:11). The meaning of the word is therefore \\"teaching\\", \\"doctrine\\", or \\"instruction\\"; the commonly accepted \\"law\\" gives a wrong impression.[7] The Alexandrian Jews who translated the Septuagint used the Greek word \\"nomos\\", meaning norm, standard, doctrine, and later \\"law\\". Greek and Latin Bibles then began the custom of calling the Pentateuch The Law. Other translational contexts in the English language include custom, theory, guidance,[8] or system.[9]\\r\\nThe term \\"Torah\\" is used in the general sense to include both Rabbinic Judaism's written law and Oral Law, serving to encompass the entire spectrum of authoritative Jewish religious teachings throughout history, including the Mishnah, the Talmud, the Midrash and more, and the inaccurate rendering of \\"Torah\\" as \\"Law\\"[10] may be an obstacle to understanding the ideal that is summed up in the term talmud torah (????? ????, \\"study of Torah\\").[2]\\r\\nThe earliest name for the first part of the Bible seems to have been \\"The Torah of Moses\\". This title, however, is found neither in the Torah itself, nor in the works of the pre-Exilic literary prophets. It appears in Joshua (8:31ÿ32; 23:6) and Kings (I Kings 2:3; II Kings 14:6; 23:25), but it cannot be said to refer there to the entire corpus (according to academic Bible criticism). In contrast, there is every likelihood that its use in the post-Exilic works (Mal. 3:22; Dan. 9:11, 13; Ezra 3:2; 7:6; Neh. 8:1; II Chron. 23:18; 30:16) was intended to be comprehensive. Other early titles were \\"The Book of Moses\\" (Ezra 6:18; Neh. 13:1; II Chron. 35:12; 25:4; cf. II Kings 14:6) and \\"The Book of the Torah\\" (Neh. 8:3), which seems to be a contraction of a fuller name, \\"The Book of the Torah of God\\" (Neh. 8:8, 18; 10:29ÿ30; cf. 9:3).[11]\\r\\nChristian scholars usually refer to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible as the \\"Pentateuch\\" (Greek: ??, \\"five scrolls\\"), a term first used in the Hellenistic Judaism of Alexandria,[12]\\r\\nThe Torah starts from the beginning of God's creating the world, through the beginnings of the people of Israel, their descent into Egypt, and the giving of the Torah at biblical Mount Sinai. It ends with the death of Moses, just before the people of Israel cross to the promised land of Canaan. Interspersed in the narrative are the specific teachings (religious obligations and civil laws) given explicitly (i.e. Ten Commandments) or implicitly embedded in the narrative (as in Exodus 12 and 13 laws of the celebration of Passover).\\r\\nIn Hebrew, the five books of the Torah are identified by the incipits in each book;[13] and the common English names for the books are derived from the Greek Septuagint and reflect the essential theme of each book:\\r\\nGenesis begins with the \\"primeval history\\" (Genesis 1ÿ11[14]), the story of the world's beginnings and the descent from Adam. This is followed by the story of the three patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), Joseph (Genesis 12ÿ50[15]) and the four matriarchs (Sarah, Rebekah, Leah, and Rachel). God gives to the patriarchs a promise of the land of Canaan, but at the end of Genesis the sons of Jacob end up leaving Canaan for Egypt due to a regional famine. They had heard that there was a grain storage and distribution facility in Egypt.\\r\\nExodus begins the story of God's revelation to his people of Israel through Moses, who leads them out of Egypt (Exodus 1ÿ18) to Mount Sinai. There the people accept the covenant with God, agreeing to be his people and abide by his holy Law, in return for his agreeing to be their God, and protect and defend them from their enemies, and provide for them and make them prosper. Moses receives the Torah from God, and teaches His laws and Covenant (Exodus 19ÿ24) to the people of Israel. It also talks about the first violation of the covenant when the Golden Calf was constructed (Exodus 32ÿ34). Exodus includes the instructions on building the Tabernacle and concludes with its actual construction (Exodus 25ÿ31; 35ÿ40).\\r\\nLeviticus begins with instructions to the Israelites on how to use the Tabernacle, which they had just built (Leviticus 1ÿ10). This is followed by rules of clean and unclean (Leviticus 11ÿ15), which includes the laws of slaughter and animals permissible to eat (see also: Kashrut), the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16), and various moral and ritual laws sometimes called the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17ÿ26). Leviticus 26 provides a detailed list of rewards for following God's commandments and a detailed list of punishments for not following them. Leviticus 17 establishes sacrifices at the Tabernacle as an everlasting ordinance, but this ordinance is altered in later books with the Temple being the only place in which sacrifices are allowed.\\r\\nNumbers tells how Israel consolidated itself as a community at Sinai (Numbers 1ÿ9), set out from Sinai to move towards Canaan and spied out the land (Numbers 10ÿ13). Because of unbelief at various points, but especially at Kadesh Barnea (Numbers 14), the Israelites were condemned to wander for forty years in the desert in the vicinity of Kadesh instead of immediately entering the Promised Land. Even Moses sins and is told he would not live to enter the land (Numbers 20). At the end of Numbers (Numbers 26ÿ35) Israel moves from Kadesh to the plains of Moab opposite Jericho, ready to enter the Promised Land.\\r\\nDeuteronomy is a series of speeches by Moses on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho. Also referred to as Mishneh Torah in Hebrew (a repeat of the Torah) the essential gist of the entire book is a rebuke to the Children of Israel to not worship idolatry, to not follow in the ways of Cana'an, and to cleave to God. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12ÿ26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27ÿ28) and gives Israel new laws (the \\"Deuteronomic Code\\").[16] At the end of the book (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, and then dies. The text emphasises that no one knows where Moses was finally buried (34:6). Knowing that he was nearing the end of his life, Moses had appointed Joshua his successor, bequeathing to him the mantle of leadership. Soon afterwards Israel begins the conquest of Canaan.\\r\\nThe Talmud holds that the Torah was written by Moses, with the exception of the last eight verses of Deuteronomy, describing his death and burial, being written by Joshua.[17] Alternatively, Rashi quotes from the Talmud that, \\"God spoke them, and Moses wrote them with tears\\".[18][19] The Mishnah includes the divine origin of the Torah as an essential tenet of Judaism.[20]\\r\\nThe modern scholarly consensus is that the Torah has multiple authors and that its composition took place over centuries.[21] This contemporary common hypothesis among biblical scholars states that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the Jahwist source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the Priestly source) into a work very like the one existing today.\\r\\n\\"The consensus of scholarship is that the stories are taken from four different written sources and that these were brought together over the course of time to form the first five books of the Bible as a composite work. The sources are known as J, the Jahwist source (from the German transliteration of the Hebrew YHWH), E, the Elohist source, P, the priestly source, and D, the Deuteronomist source. ... Thus, the Pentateuch (or Torah, as it is known by Jews) comprises material taken from six centuries of human history, which has been put together to give a comprehensive picture of the creation of the world and of God's dealings with his peoples, specifically with the people of Israel.\\" (Professor John Riches of the University of Glasgow).[22]\\r\\nRabbinic writings indicate that the Oral Torah was given to Moses at Mount Sinai, which, according to the tradition of Orthodox Judaism, occurred in 1312?BC. The Orthodox rabbinic tradition holds that the Written Torah was recorded during the following forty years,[23] though many non-Orthodox Jewish scholars affirm the modern scholarly consensus that the Written Torah has multiple authors and was written over centuries.[24]\\r\\nThe Talmud (Gittin 60a) presents two opinions as to how exactly the Torah was written down by Moses. One opinion holds that it was written by Moses gradually as it was dictated to him, and finished it close to his death, and the other opinion holds that Moses wrote the complete Torah in one writing close to his death, based on what was dictated to him over the years.\\r\\nThe Talmud (Menachot 30a) says that the last eight verses of the Torah that discuss the death and burial of Moses could not have been written by Moses, as writing it would have been a lie, and that they were written after his death by Joshua. Abraham ibn Ezra[25] and Joseph Bonfils observed[citation needed] that phrases in those verses present information that people should only have known after the time of Moses. Ibn Ezra hinted,[26] and Bonfils explicitly stated, that Joshua wrote these verses many years after the death of Moses. Other commentators[27] do not accept this position and maintain that although Moses did not write those eight verses it was nonetheless dictated to him and that Joshua wrote it based on instructions left by Moses, and that the Torah often describes future events, some of which have yet to occur.\\r\\nAll classical rabbinic views hold that the Torah was entirely Mosaic and of divine origin.[28] Present-day Reform and Liberal Jewish movements all reject Mosaic authorship, as do most shades of Conservative Judaism.[29]\\r\\nAccording to Legends of the Jews, God gave Torah to the children of Israel after he approached every tribe and nation in the world, and offered them the Torah, but the latter refused it so they might have no excuse to be ignorant about it.[30] In this book, Torah is defined as one of the first things created, as remedy against the evil inclination,[31] and as the counselor who advised God to create human in the creation of world in order to make him the honored One.[32]\\r\\nTorah reading (Hebrew: ????? ?????, K'riat HaTorah, \\"Reading [of] the Torah\\") is a Jewish religious ritual that involves the public reading of a set of passages from a Torah scroll. The term often refers to the entire ceremony of removing the Torah scroll (or scrolls) from the ark, chanting the appropriate excerpt with traditional cantillation, and returning the scroll(s) to the ark. It is distinct from academic Torah study.\\r\\nRegular public reading of the Torah was introduced by Ezra the Scribe after the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity (c. 537?BCE), as described in the Book of Nehemiah.[33] In the modern era, adherents of Orthodox Judaism practice Torah-reading according to a set procedure they believe has remained unchanged in the two thousand years since the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (70?CE). In the 19th and 20th centuries CE, new movements such as Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism have made adaptations to the practice of Torah reading, but the basic pattern of Torah reading has usually remained the same:\\r\\nAs a part of the morning prayer services on certain days of the week, fast days, and holidays, as well as part of the afternoon prayer services of Shabbat, Yom Kippur, and fast days, a section of the Pentateuch is read from a Torah scroll. On Shabbat (Saturday) mornings, a weekly section (\\"parashah\\") is read, selected so that the entire Pentateuch is read consecutively each year. The division of parashot found in the modern-day Torah scrolls of all Jewish communities (Ashkenazic, Sephardic, and Yemenite) is based upon the systematic list provided by Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls, chapter 8. Maimonides based his division of the parashot for the Torah on the Aleppo Codex. Conservative and Reform synagogues may read parashot on a triennial rather than annual schedule,[34][35][36] On Saturday afternoons, Mondays, and Thursdays, the beginning of the following Saturday's portion is read. On Jewish holidays, the beginnings of each month, and fast days, special sections connected to the day are read.\\r\\nJews observe an annual holiday, Simchat Torah, to celebrate the completion and new start of the year's cycle of readings.\\r\\nTorah scrolls are often dressed with a sash, a special Torah cover, various ornaments and a Keter (crown), although such customs vary among synagogues. Congregants traditionally stand in respect when the Torah is brought out of the ark to be read, while it is being carried, and lifted, and likewise while it is returned to the ark, although they may sit during the reading itself.\\r\\nThe Torah contains narratives, statements of law, and statements of ethics. Collectively these laws, usually called biblical law or commandments, are sometimes referred to as the Law of Moses (Torat Moshe ???????????????), Mosaic Law, or Sinaitic Law.\\r\\nRabbinic tradition holds that Moses learned the whole Torah while he lived on Mount Sinai for 40 days and nights and both the oral and the written Torah were transmitted in parallel with each other. Where the Torah leaves words and concepts undefined, and mentions procedures without explanation or instructions, the reader is required to seek out the missing details from supplemental sources known as the oral law or oral Torah.[37] Some of the Torah's most prominent commandments needing further explanation are:\\r\\nAccording to classical rabbinic texts this parallel set of material was originally transmitted to Moses at Sinai, and then from Moses to Israel. At that time it was forbidden to write and publish the oral law, as any writing would be incomplete and subject to misinterpretation and abuse.[38]\\r\\nHowever, after exile, dispersion, and persecution, this tradition was lifted when it became apparent that in writing was the only way to ensure that the Oral Law could be preserved. After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200?CE by Rabbi Judah haNasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the Mishnah (Hebrew: ????). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as \\"Baraitot\\" (external teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.\\r\\nAfter continued persecution more of the oral law was committed to writing. A great many more lessons, lectures and traditions only alluded to in the few hundred pages of Mishnah, became the thousands of pages now called the Gemara. Gemara is written in Aramaic, having been compiled in Babylon. The Mishnah and Gemara together are called the Talmud. The Rabbis in Israel also collected their traditions and compiled them into the Jerusalem Talmud. Since the greater number of Rabbis lived in Babylon, the Babylonian Talmud has precedence should the two be in conflict.\\r\\nOrthodox and Conservative branches of Judaism accept these texts as the basis for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts, or the Torah itself for that matter, may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history.[citation needed] Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.[39]\\r\\nKabbalists hold that not only do the words of Torah give a divine message, but they also indicate a far greater message that extends beyond them. Thus they hold that even as small a mark as a kotzo shel yod (???? ?? ???), the serif of the Hebrew letter yod (?), the smallest letter, or decorative markings, or repeated words, were put there by God to teach scores of lessons. This is regardless of whether that yod appears in the phrase \\"I am the Lord thy God\\" (??????? ?????? ??????????, Exodus 20:2) or whether it appears in \\"And God spoke unto Moses saying\\" (?????????? ????????, ???-??????; ????????? ??????, ????? ??????.? Exodus 6:2). In a similar vein, Rabbi Akiva (c. 50 ÿ c. 135 CE), is said to have learned a new law from every et (??) in the Torah (Talmud, tractate Pesachim 22b); the particle et is meaningless by itself, and serves only to mark the direct object. In other words, the Orthodox belief is that even apparently contextual text \\"And God spoke unto Moses saying?...\\" is no less important than the actual statement.\\r\\nManuscript Torah scrolls are still scribed and used for ritual purposes (i.e., religious services); this is called a Sefer Torah (\\"Book [of] Torah\\"). They are written using a painstakingly careful methodology by highly qualified scribes. This has resulted in, according to B. Barry Levy, \\"The popular assumption that no changes were ever introduced into copies of the Bible during rabbinic times.\\" However, he writes that this \\"simply does not accord with the facts\\".[40] It is believed that every word, or marking, has divine meaning, and that not one part may be inadvertently changed lest it lead to error. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error of a single letter, ornamentation, or symbol of the 304,805 stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use, hence a special skill is required and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.\\r\\nAccording to Jewish law, a sefer Torah (plural: Sifrei Torah) is a copy of the formal Hebrew text handwritten on gevil or klaf (forms of parchment) by using a quill (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Written entirely in Hebrew, a sefer Torah contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained sofer (\\"scribe\\"), an effort that may take as long as approximately one and a half years. Most modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty), and very strict rules about the position and appearance of the Hebrew letters are observed. See for example the Mishnah Berurah on the subject.[41] Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting.\\r\\nThe completion of the sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and it is a mitzvah for every Jew to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Torah scrolls are stored in the holiest part of the synagogue in the Ark known as the \\"Holy Ark\\" (?????? ??????? aron hakodesh in Hebrew.) Aron in Hebrew means \\"cupboard\\" or \\"closet\\", and kodesh is derived from \\"kadosh\\", or \\"holy\\".\\r\\nThe Book of Ezra refers to translations and commentaries of the Hebrew text into Aramaic, the more commonly understood language of the time. These translations would seem to date to the 6th century BCE. The Aramaic term for translation is Targum.[42] The Encyclopedia Judaica has:\\r\\nAt an early period, it was customary to translate the Hebrew text into the vernacular at the time of the reading (e.g., in Palestine and Babylon the translation was into Aramaic). The targum (\\"translation\\") was done by a special synagogue official, called the meturgeman ... Eventually, the practice of translating into the vernacular was discontinued.[43]\\r\\nHowever, there is no suggestion that these translations had been written down as early as this. There are suggestions that the Targum was written down at an early date, although for private use only.\\r\\nThe official recognition of a written Targum and the final redaction of its text, however, belong to the post-Talmudic period, thus not earlier than the fifth century C.E.[44]\\r\\nOne of the earliest known translations of the first five books of Moses from the Hebrew into Greek was the Septuagint. This is a Koine Greek version of the Hebrew Bible that was used by Greek speakers. The Greek version's name in Latin is the Septuagint: Latin septem meaning seven, plus -gint meaning \\"times ten\\". It was named Septuagint from the traditional number of its translators. This Greek version of the Hebrew Scriptures dates from the 3rd century BCE, originally associated with Hellenistic Judaism. It contains both a translation of the Hebrew and additional and variant material.[45]\\r\\nLater translations into Greek include seven or more other versions. These do not survive, except as fragments, and include those by Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.[46]\\r\\nEarly translations into Latinthe Vetus Latinawere ad hoc conversions of parts of the Septuagint. With Saint Jerome in the 4th century CE came the Vulgate Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible.\\r\\nFrom the eighth century AD, the cultural language of Jews living under Islamic rule became Arabic rather than Aramaic. \\"Around that time, both scholars and lay people started producing translations of the Bible into Judeo-Arabic using the Hebrew alphabet.\\" Later, by the 10th century, it became essential for a standard version of the Bible in Judeo-Arabic. The best known was produced by Saadiah, and continues to be in use today, \\"in particular among Yemenite Jewry\\".[47]\\r\\nRav Sa'adia produced an Arabic translation of the Torah known as Targum Tafsir and offered comments on Rasag's work.[48] There is a debate in scholarship whether Rasag wrote the first Arabic translation of the Torah.[49]\\r\\nThe Torah has been translated by Jewish scholars into most of the major European languages, including English, German, Russian, French, Spanish and others. The most well-known German-language translation was produced by Samson Raphael Hirsch. A number of Jewish English Bible translations have been published.\\r\\nAs a part of the Christian Biblical canon, the Torah has been translated into hundreds of languages.\\r\\nThe major figure in Christianity, Jesus Christ emphasized that the Law of Moses has prominent role in his teachings that fulfilling Torah,[50] because whoever who believe in Moses' writings would also believe in Jesus' words:[51][52]\\r\\nDo not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings (Torah), how shall ye believe my words?\\r\\nAmong early centers of Christianity the Septuagint was used by Greek speakers, while Aramaic Targums were used by Aramaic speakers such as the Syriac Orthodox Church. It was regarded as the standard form of the \\"Old Testament\\" in the early Greek Christian Church and is still considered canonical in the Eastern Orthodox Church.[53] Though different Christian denominations have slightly different versions of the \\"Old Testament\\" in their Bibles, the Torah as the \\"Five Books of Moses\\" (or \\"the Mosaic Law\\") is common among them all.\\r\\nWhile Christianity includes the five books of Moses (the Pentateuch) among their sacred texts in its \\"Old Testament\\", Islam states that only the original Torah was sent by God. In neither religion does the Torah retain the religious legal significance that it does in Orthodox Judaism.\\r\\nThe Quran refers heavily to Moses to outline the truth of his existence and the religious guidelines that God had revealed to the Children of Israel. According to the Qur'an, Allah says, \\"It is He Who has sent down the Book (the Qur'an) to you with truth, confirming what came before it. And He sent down the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel).\\" [3:3]\\r\\nMuslims call the Torah the Tawrat and consider it the word of God given to Moses. However, Muslims also believe that this original revelation was corrupted (tahrif) (or simply altered by the passage of time and human fallibility) over time by Jewish scribes[54] and hence do not revere the present \\"Jewish version\\" Torah as much.7:144ÿ144 The Torah in the Quran is always mentioned with respect in Islam. The Muslims' belief in the Torah, as well as the prophethood of Moses, is one of the fundamental tenets of Islam.\\r\\nThe Bah' position on the Torah was composed in 1906 by its official interpreter on all matters religious, Sir 'Abdu'l-Bah' Abbas K.B.E.\\r\\n\\"The Torah, held to be the most ancient of histories, existeth today in three separate versions: the Hebrew, considered authentic by the Jews and the Protestant clergy; the Greek Septuagint, which was used as authoritative in the Greek and other eastern churches; and the Samaritan Torah, the standard authority for that people. These three versions differ greatly, one from another, even with regard to the lifetimes of the most celebrated figures. In the Hebrew Torah, it is recorded that from Noah's flood until the birth of Abraham there was an interval of two hundred and ninety-two years. In the Greek, that time span is given as one thousand and seventy-two years, while the Samaritan, the recorded span is nine hundred and forty-two years. Refer to the commentary by Henry Westcott for tables are supplied therein which show the discrepancies among the three Torahs as to the birth dates of a number of the descendants of Shem, and thou wilt see how greatly the versions differ from one another. Moreover, according to the text of the Hebrew Torah, from the creation of Adam until Noah's flood the elapsed time is recorded as one thousand six hundred and fifty-six years, while in the Greek Torah the interval is given as two thousand two hundred and sixty-two years, and in the Samaritan text, the same period is said to have lasted one thousand three hundred and seven years. Reflect now over the discrepancies among these three Torahs. The case is indeed surprising. The Jews and Protestants belittle the Greek Torah, while to the Greeks, the Hebrew version is spurious, and the Samaritans deny both the Hebrew and the Greek versions.\\"\\r\\n'Abdu'l Bah's elucidations above in 1906 are found in his letter to Ethel Jenner Rosenberg (1858ÿ1930, without issue and no relation to the famous spies, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg)","input":"What are the first 5 books of moses?"},{"output":"a couturier who takes a young waitress, played by Vicky Krieps, as his muse","context":"Phantom Thread is a 2017 American period drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, set in London's couture world in 1954. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis as a couturier who takes a young waitress, played by Vicky Krieps, as his muse;[6] it is reportedly Day-Lewis's final role before retiring.[7] The film is the first Anderson film shot outside the United States, with principal photography beginning in January 2017 in Lythe, England. It is Anderson's second collaboration with Day-Lewis, following There Will Be Blood (2007), and his fourth with composer Jonny Greenwood.\\r\\nPhantom Thread premiered in New York City on December 11, 2017, and was released in the United States on December 25, 2017.[8] The film received critical acclaim, with praise for its performances, screenplay, direction, musical score, and production values. It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of 2017's top ten films.[9] At the 90th Academy Awards, the film earned six nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Day-Lewis, Supporting Actress for Lesley Manville and Best Original Score, and won for Best Costume Design.

His charisma and genius are matched by his obsessive, controlling and sometimes abusive personality. Cyril, his sister, manages the day-to-day operations of his fashion house and has significant influence over his life. Reynolds is haunted by the death of their mother, and stitches hidden messages into the linings of the dresses he makes.\\r\\nAfter designing a new gown for a revered client, Reynolds visits a restaurant in the countryside and becomes interested in a waitress, Alma. He asks her on a date, and she accepts. Their relationship develops, and she moves in with him, becoming his assistant, muse and lover. Cyril initially distrusts Alma but comes to respect her willfulness and determination.\\r\\nAt first, Alma enjoys being a part of Reynolds' work, but he proves aloof and hard to please, and they bicker. When Alma tries to surprise him with a romantic dinner, Reynolds lashes out and they fight. Alma wonders aloud what she is doing in his house beyond either waiting for him to pay attention to her or ask her to leave.\\r\\nIn order to regain her power in their relationship and to punish and make Reynolds more vulnerable and needy, Alma laces his tea with a small amount of poisonous mushroom gathered outside his country house. The next morning, dizzy and sweating, while he readies a wedding gown for a Belgian princess, he collapses, damaging the dress and forcing his staff to work all night to repair it. He becomes gravely ill and sees his mother in the room; he tells her how much he misses her. Alma nurses him through his fever; when Cyril brings in a doctor, first Reynolds and then Alma tell the doctor to \\"Fuck off.\\" When Reynolds is well again, he asks Alma to marry him, telling her that there are things that he must do and he cannot do them without her. Alma accepts and they are married.\\r\\nOn vacation in the Swiss Alps, once again, Reynolds starts saying cruel and cutting things to Alma both privately and in front of their friends; they fight and defy each other again. As Reynolds' anxiety about his work increases, he complains to Cyril about Alma, who enters the room and overhears the conversation; neither Reynolds nor Alma is perturbed. We see Alma in the forest again, gathering mushrooms. One evening, she prepares a poisoned omelette as Reynolds watches her from the dining room table. As he slowly chews his first bite, she informs him that she wants him weak and vulnerable with only her to take care of him; after that, she wants him strong again. Reynolds implicitly consents by swallowing one bite of the omelette, responding, \\"Kiss me, my girl, before I'm sick.\\" In the next scene, they are in Reynolds' bedroom: Alma sits with Reynolds, in pajamas with a pan in his lap; they smile happily and kiss before he tells her that it's time for her to leave the room to which she responds, \\"I'll be right outside the door.\\"\\r\\nLater in a voiceover, Alma imagines their future with children, a rich social life, and her running the dressmaking business as a partner. We see Alma pushing a baby carriage which she hands over to Cyril so that she and Reynolds can go out. In the present moment, we see Reynolds with his head in Alma's lap as they enjoy the fireplace; Reynolds remarks that he is getting hungry.\\r\\nAnderson became interested in the fashion industry after reading about designer Crist܇bal Balenciaga.[15] The story is loosely modeled on the British fashion designer Charles James.[16]\\r\\nPrincipal photography began in late January 2017 in Lythe, United Kingdom,[17][18] with a number of other locations in the North York Moors National Park also featuring, including Robin Hood's Bay and Staithes.[19]\\r\\nFilming also took place in 2017 at Owlpen Manor in the Cotswolds[20] and in the London neighborhood of Fitzrovia, in Fitzroy Square, and Grafton Mews.[21] Woodcock drives a maroon Bristol 405 in the film.[22]\\r\\nIt was reported in June 2017 that Anderson would be serving as his own cinematographer on the film as Robert Elswit was unavailable during production.[23] However, Anderson refuted the claim in November, stating that there is no official credit for the cinematography and that it was a \\"collaborative effort\\".[15] Anderson and his lighting collaborator, Michael Bauman, pushed their 35mm film stock and filled the frame with haze in order to \\"dirty up\\" the image; according to Bauman, \\"One of the first things [Paul] said was, 'Look, this cannot look like The Crown.'

His technique saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town and was adopted by surgeons in Britain and the United States.[4] In 1955, he travelled to the United States and was initially assigned further gastrointestinal work by Owen Harding Wangensteen.[5] He was introduced to the heart-lung machine, and Barnard was allowed to transfer to the service run by open heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei.[6] Upon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at the Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town.[7]\\r\\nOn 3 December 1967, Barnard transplanted the heart of Denise Darvall, who had just died from a head injury, into the chest of a 54-year-old Louis Washkansky. Washkansky regained full consciousness and lived for eighteen days, even spending time with his wife, before he died of pneumonia, with the suppression of his immune system by the anti-rejection drugs being a major contributing factor.[3][8] Barnard had told Mr. and Mrs. Washkansky that the operation had an 80% chance of success, a claim which has been criticised as misleading.[9][10][11]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant patient Philip Blaiberg, with the operation performed at the beginning of 1968, lived for nineteen months and was able to go home from the hospital.[3][12]\\r\\nHe retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He became interested in anti-aging research, and in 1986 his reputation suffered when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter. During his remaining years, he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world. He died in 2001 at the age of 78 after an asthma attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBarnard grew up in Beaufort West, Cape Province, Union of South Africa. His father, Adam Barnard, was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church.[2] One of his four brothers, Abraham, was a \\"blue baby\\" who died of a heart problem at the age of three (Barnard would later guess that it was tetralogy of Fallot). The family also experienced the loss of a daughter who was stillborn and who had been the fraternal twin of Barnard's older brother Johannes, who was twelve years older than Chris.[13] Barnard matriculated from the Beaufort West High School in 1940, and went to study medicine at the University of Cape Town Medical School, where he obtained his MB ChB in 1945.\\r\\nHis father served as a missionary to mixed-race peoples. His mother, the former Maria Elisabeth de Swart, instilled in the surviving brothers the belief that they could do anything they set their minds to.[3]\\r\\nBarnard did his internship and residency at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, after which he worked as a general practitioner in Ceres, a rural town in the Cape Province.[2] In 1951, he returned to Cape Town where he worked at the City Hospital as a Senior Resident Medical Officer, and in the Department of Medicine at the Groote Schuur Hospital as a registrar.[2] He completed his master's degree, receiving Master of Medicine in 1953 from the University of Cape Town. In the same year he obtained a doctorate in medicine (MD) from the same university for a dissertation titled \\"The treatment of tuberculous meningitis\\".\\r\\nSoon after qualifying as a doctor, Barnard performed experiments on dogs investigating intestinal atresia, a birth defect which allows life-threatening gaps to develop in the intestines. He followed a medical hunch that this was caused by inadequate blood flow to the fetus. After nine months and forty-three attempts, Barnard was able to reproduce this condition in a fetus puppy by tying off some of the blood supply to a puppy's intestines and then placing the animal back in the womb, after which it was born some two weeks later, with the condition of intestinal atresia. He was also able to cure the condition by removing the piece of intestine with inadequate blood supply. The mistake of previous surgeons had been attempting to reconnect ends of intestine which themselves still had inadequate blood supply. To be successful, it was typically necessary to remove between 15 and 20 centimeters of intestine (6 to 8 inches). Jannie Louw used this innovation in a clinical setting, and Barnard's method saved the lives of ten babies in Cape Town. This technique was also adapted by surgeons in Britain and the US. In addition, Barnard analyzed 259 cases of tubercular meningitis.[4]\\r\\nOwen Wangensteen in Minnesota had been impressed by the work of Alan Thal, a young South African doctor working in Minnesota. He asked Groote Schuur Head of Medicine John Brock if he might recommend any similarly talented South Africans and Brock recommended Barnard.[14] In December 1955, Barnard travelled to the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States, to begin a two-year scholarship under Chief of Surgery Wangensteen, who assigned Barnard more work on the intestines, which Barnard accepted even though he wanted to move onto something new.[5] Simply by luck, whenever Barnard needed a break from this work, he could wander across the hall and talk with Vince Gott who ran the lab for open-heart surgery pioneer Walt Lillehei. Gott had begun to develop a technique of running blood backwards through the veins of the heart so Lillehei could more easily operate on the aortic valve (McRae writes, \\"It was the type of inspired thinking that entranced Barnard\\"). In March 1956, Gott asked Barnard to help him run the heart-lung machine for an operation.[6] Shortly thereafter, Wangensteen agreed to let Barnard switch to Lillehei's service. It was during this time that Barnard first became acquainted with fellow future heart transplantation surgeon Norman Shumway.[15] Barnard also became friendly with Gil Campbell who had demonstrated that a dog's lung could be used to oxygenate blood during open-heart surgery. (The year before Barnard arrived, Lillehei and Campbell had used this procedure for twenty minutes during surgery on a 13-year-old boy with ventricular septal defect, and the boy had made a full recovery.) Barnard and Campbell met regularly for early breakfast.[16] In 1958, Barnard received a Master of Science in Surgery for a thesis titled \\"The aortic valve ÿ problems in the fabrication and testing of a prosthetic valve\\".[2] The same year he was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation titled \\"The aetiology of congenital intestinal atresia\\".[2] Barnard described the two years he spent in the United States as \\"the most fascinating time in my life.\\"\\r\\nUpon returning to South Africa in 1958, Barnard was appointed head of the Department of Experimental Surgery at Groote Schuur hospital, as well as holding a joint post at the University of Cape Town.[7][17] He was promoted to full-time lecturer and Director of Surgical Research at the University of Cape Town. In 1960, he flew to Moscow in order to meet Vladimir Demikhov, a top expert on organ transplants[18] (later he credited Demikhov's accomplishment saying that \\"if there is a father of heart and lung transplantation then Demikhov certainly deserves this title.\\")[19] In 1961 he was appointed Head of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the teaching hospitals of the University of Cape Town. He rose to the position of Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1962. Barnard's younger brother Marius, who also studied medicine, eventually became Barnard's right-hand man at the department of Cardiac Surgery.[2] Over time, Barnard became known as a brilliant surgeon with many contributions to the treatment of cardiac diseases, such as the Tetralogy of Fallot and Ebstein's anomaly. He was promoted to Professor of Surgical Science in the Department of Surgery at the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1981, Barnard became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[20] Among the many awards he received over the years, he was named Professor Emeritus in 1984.\\r\\nFollowing the first successful kidney transplant in 1953, in the United States, Barnard performed the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.[21][page?needed][22]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1964, James Hardy at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi, performed the world's first heart transplant and world's first cardiac xenotransplant by transplanting the heart of a chimpanzee into a desperately ill and dying man. This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.[23][24][25][26][27][28]\\r\\nBarnard had experimentally transplanted forty-eight hearts into dogs, which was about a fifth the number that Adrian Kantrowitz had performed at Maimonides Medical Center in New York and about a sixth the number Norman Shumway had performed at Stanford University in California. Barnard had no dogs which had survived longer than ten days, unlike Kantrowitz and Shumway who had had dogs survive for more than a year.[29][30] [31]\\r\\nWith the availability of new breakthroughs introduced by several pioneers, also including Richard Lower at the Medical College of Virginia, several surgical teams were in a position to prepare for a human heart transplant.[2][32] Barnard had a patient willing to undergo the procedure, but as with other surgeons, he needed a suitable donor.[2][31]\\r\\nDuring the Apartheid era in South Africa, non-white persons and citizens were not given equal opportunities in the medical professions. At Groote Schuur Hospital, Hamilton Naki was an informally taught surgeon. He started out as a gardener and cleaner. One day he was asked to help out with an experiment on a giraffe. From this modest beginning, Naki became principal lab technician and taught hundreds[33] of surgeons, and assisted with Barnard's organ transplant program. Barnard said, \\"Hamilton Naki had better technical skills than I did. He was a better craftsman than me, especially when it came to stitching, and had very good hands in the theatre\\". A popular myth, propagated principally by a widely discredited documentary film called Hidden Heart[34][35][36][37] and an erroneous newspaper article[33] , maintains incorrectly that Naki was present during the Washkansky transplant.[38][33]\\r\\nBarnard performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant operation in the early morning hours of Sunday 3 December 1967.[1][3][39] Louis Washkansky, a 54-year-old grocer who was suffering from diabetes and incurable heart disease, was the patient.[8][40] Barnard was assisted by his brother Marius Barnard, as well as a team of thirty persons. The operation lasted approximately five hours.[31][41][42][40]\\r\\nBarnard stated to Washkansky and his wife Ann Washkansky that the transplant had an 80% chance of success.[9][11][43] This has been criticised by the ethicists Peter Singer and Helga Kuhse as making claims for chances of success to the patient and family which were \\"unfounded\\" and \\"misleading\\".[10]\\r\\nBarnard later wrote, \\"For a dying man it is not a difficult decision because he knows he is at the end. If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced you have a chance to swim to the other side.\\" The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town.[2] On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear.[44] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt.[45] The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins.[46] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard.[2] Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, \\"Chris stood there for a few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'\\"[2][31]\\r\\nWashkansky survived the operation and lived for 18 days, having succumbed to pneumonia as he was taking immunosuppressive drugs.\\r\\nBarnard was celebrated around the world for his accomplishment. He was photogenic, and enjoyed the media attention following the operation.\\r\\nWorldwide, approximately 100 transplants were performed by various doctors during 1968.[47] Only a third of these patients lived longer than three months. A U.S. National Institutes of Health publication states, \\"Within several years, only Shumway's team at Stanford was attempting transplants.\\"[32]\\r\\nBarnard's second transplant operation was conducted on 2 January 1968, and the patient, Philip Blaiberg, survived for 19 months.[3][12] Dirk van Zyl, who received a new heart in 1971, was the longest-lived recipient, surviving over 23 years.[48]\\r\\nBetween December 1967 and November 1974 at Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa, ten heart transplants were performed, as well as a heart and lung transplant in 1971. Of these ten patients, four lived longer than 18 months, with two of these four becoming long-term survivors. One patient lived for over thirteen years and another for over twenty-four years.[49]\\r\\nFull recovery of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, during which time considerable damage can occur. Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. Barnard designed the idea of the heterotopic (or \\"piggy back\\" transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a \\"double heart\\". Barnard performed the first such heterotopic heart transplant in 1974.[49][50]\\r\\nFrom November 1974 through December 1983, 49 consecutive heterotopic heart transplants on 43 patients were performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, as compared to less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.[49]\\r\\nMany surgeons gave up cardiac transplantation due to poor results, often due to rejection of the transplanted heart by the patient's immune system. Barnard persisted until the advent of cyclosporine, an effective immunosuppressive drug, which helped revive the operation throughout the world. He also attempted xenotransplantation in a human patient, while attempting to save the life of a girl who was unable to leave artificial life support after her second aortic valve replacement.\\r\\nBarnard was an outspoken opponent of South Africa's laws of apartheid, and was not afraid to criticise his nation's government, although he had to temper his remarks to some extent to travel abroad.[citation needed] Rather than leaving his homeland, he used his fame to campaign for a change in the law. Christiaan's brother, Marius Barnard, went into politics, and was elected to the legislature from Progressive Federal Party. Barnard later stated that the reason he never won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was probably because he was a \\"white South African\\".[51]\\r\\nShortly before his visit to Kenya in 1978, the following was written about his views regarding race relations in South Africa; \\"While he believes in the participation of Africans in the political process of South Africa, he is opposed to a one-man-one-vote system in South Africa\\".[52]\\r\\nIn answering a hypothetical question on how he would solve the race problem were he a \\"benevolent dictator in South Africa\\", Barnard stated the following in a long interview at the Weekly Review:[53]\\r\\nThe interview ended with the following summary from he himself; \\"I often say that, like King Lear, South Africa is a country more sinned against than sinning.\\"[53]\\r\\nBarnard's first marriage was to Aletta Gertruida Louw, a nurse, whom he married in 1948 while practising medicine in Ceres. The couple had two children? Deirdre (born 1950) and Andre (1951ÿ1984).[2][54] International fame took a toll on his personal life, and in 1969, Barnard and his wife divorced. In 1970, he married heiress Barbara Zoellner when she was 19, the same age as his son, and they had two children? Frederick (born 1972) and Christiaan Jr. (born 1974).[55] He divorced Zoellner in 1982.[55] Barnard married for a third time in 1988 to Karin Setzkorn, a young model.[55] They also had two children, Armin (born 1989) and Lara (born 1997), but this last marriage also ended in divorce in 2000.[55]\\r\\nBarnard described in his autobiography The Second Life a one-night extramarital affair with Italian film star Gina Lollobrigida,[2][56] that occurred in January 1968. During that visit to Rome he received an audience from Pope Paul VI.[57]\\r\\nIn October 2016, U.S. Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster (D-NH) stated that Barnard sexually assaulted her when she was 23 years old. According to Kuster, he attempted to grope her under her skirt, while seated at a business luncheon with Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-CA), whom she worked for at the time.[58][59][60]\\r\\nBarnard retired as Head of the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery in Cape Town in 1983 after developing rheumatoid arthritis in his hands which ended his surgical career. He had struggled with arthritis since 1956, when it was diagnosed during his postgraduate work in the United States.[2] After retirement, he spent two years as the Scientist-In-Residence at the Oklahoma Transplantation Institute in the United States and as an acting consultant for various institutions.[citation needed]\\r\\nHe had by this time become very interested in anti-aging research, and his reputation suffered in 1986 when he promoted Glycel, an expensive \\"anti-aging\\" skin cream, whose approval was withdrawn by the United States Food and Drug Administration soon thereafter.[3] He also spent time as a research advisor to the Clinique la Prairie, in Switzerland, where the controversial \\"rejuvenation therapy\\" was practised.[61]\\r\\nBarnard divided the remainder of his years between Austria, where he established the Christiaan Barnard Foundation, dedicated to helping underprivileged children throughout the world, and his game farm in Beaufort West, South Africa.[citation needed]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard died on 2 September 2001, while on holiday in Paphos, Cyprus. Early reports stated that he had died of a heart attack, but an autopsy showed his death was caused by a severe asthma attack.[62]\\r\\nChristiaan Barnard wrote two autobiographies. His first book, One Life, was published in 1969 (ISBN?0245599525) and sold copies worldwide. Some of the proceeds were used to set up the Chris Barnard Fund for research into heart disease and heart transplants in Cape Town.[63] His second autobiography, The Second Life, was published in 1993, eight years before his death (ISBN?0947461388).\\r\\nApart from his autobiographies, Dr Barnard also wrote several other books including:[64]","input":"Who performed the first successful human heart operation?"},{"output":"British Regency period","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nPride and Prejudice is an 1813 romantic novel by Jane Austen. It charts the emotional development of protagonist Elizabeth Bennet, who learns the error of making hasty judgments and comes to appreciate the difference between the superficial and the essential. The comedy of the writing lies in the depiction of manners, education, marriage, and money during the British Regency period.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Bennet of the Longbourn estate has five daughters, but his property is entailed, meaning that none of the girls can inherit it.  His wife has no fortune, so it is imperative that at least one of the girls marry well in order to support the others upon his death.  Jane Austen's opening line, \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\\", is a sentence filled with irony and playfulness.  The novel revolves around the importance of marrying for love, not simply for money, despite the social pressures to make a good (i.e., wealthy) match.\\r\\n\\r\\nPride and Prejudice has long fascinated readers, consistently appearing near the top of lists of \\"most-loved books\\" among both literary scholars and the general public.  It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and paved the way for many archetypes that abound in modern literature.[1][better?source?needed]  For more than a century, amateur and professional dramatic adaptations, print continuations and sequels, and film and TV versions of Pride and Prejudice have reimagined the original novel's memorable characters and themes to reach mass audiences.[2] The 2005 film, Pride & Prejudice, starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen is the most recent Hollywood adaptation of the book.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel opens with Mrs. Bennet trying to persuade Mr. Bennet to visit Mr. Bingley, a rich and eligible bachelor who has arrived in the neighbourhood. After some verbal sparring with Mr. Bennet baiting his wife, it transpires that this visit has already taken place at Netherfield, Mr. Bingley's rented house. The visit is followed by an invitation to a ball at the local assembly rooms that the whole neighbourhood will attend.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the ball, Mr. Bingley is open and cheerful, popular with all the guests, and appears to be very attracted to the beautiful Miss Jane Bennet. His friend, Mr. Darcy, is reputed to be twice as wealthy; however, he is haughty and aloof. He declines to dance with Elizabeth, suggesting that she is not pretty enough to tempt him.[3] She finds this amusing and jokes about the statement with her friends. Mr. Bingley's sister, Caroline, later invites Jane to visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Jane visits Miss Bingley, she is caught in a rain shower on the way and comes down with a serious cold. Elizabeth visits the ill Jane at Netherfield. There Darcy begins to be attracted to Elizabeth, while Miss Bingley becomes jealous, since she has designs on Darcy herself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins, a cousin of Mr. Bennet and heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family. He is a pompous and obsequious clergyman, who expects each of the Bennet girls to wish to marry him due to his inheritance. He quickly decides to propose to Elizabeth when he is led to believe Jane is taken, but is refused.\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth and her family meet the dashing and charming George Wickham, who singles out Elizabeth and tells her a story of the hardship that Mr. Darcy has caused him by depriving him of a living (position as clergyman in a prosperous parish with good revenue that, once granted, is for life) promised to him by Mr. Darcy's late father. Elizabeth's dislike of Mr. Darcy is confirmed.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt a ball at Netherfield, Elizabeth reluctantly dances with Mr. Darcy. Other than Jane and Elizabeth, several members of the Bennet family show a distinct lack of decorum. Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she fully expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged and the younger Bennet sisters otherwise expose the family to ridicule.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Collins proposes to Elizabeth, who rejects him, to the fury of her mother and the relief of her father. Shortly thereafter, they receive news that the Bingleys are suddenly leaving for London, with no intention to return. After his humiliating rejection by Elizabeth, Mr. Collins proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a sensible young woman and Elizabeth's friend. Charlotte is slightly older and is grateful to receive a proposal that will guarantee her a comfortable home. Elizabeth is aghast at such pragmatism in matters of love. Heartbroken, Jane goes to visit her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner at an unfashionable address in London. Miss Bingley clearly does not want to continue the friendship and Jane is upset though very composed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins in Kent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, the imposing home of Lady Catherine de Bourgh, patroness of Mr. Collins and Mr. Darcy's extremely wealthy aunt. She expects Mr. Darcy to marry her daughter. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting at Rosings Park. Colonel Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy managed to save a friend from a bad match. Elizabeth realizes the story must refer to Jane and is horrified that Darcy has interfered and caused her sister so much pain. Mr. Darcy, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Elizabeth and proposes to her. She rejects him angrily, stating that she could not love a man who has caused her sister such unhappiness and further accuses him of treating Mr. Wickham unjustly. The latter accusation seems to anger Mr. Darcy, and he accuses her family of lacking propriety and suggests he has been kinder to Bingley than himself. They part, barely speaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter, explaining that Mr. Wickham had refused the living he claimed he was deprived of, and was given money for it instead. Wickham proceeded to waste the money and, then impoverished, demanded the living again. After being refused, he tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her great dowry. Darcy also writes that he believed Jane, because of her reserved behavior, did not love Mr. Bingley. Darcy apologizes for hurting Jane and Elizabeth begins to change her opinion of Mr. Darcy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome months later, Elizabeth and her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner visit Darcy's estate in Derbyshire, Pemberley. On a tour there, Elizabeth hears the housekeeper describe him as being kind and generous. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is overwhelmingly kind and later invites Elizabeth and the Gardiners to meet his sister and go fishing. Elizabeth is surprised and delighted by the kindness to herself and her aunt and uncle. She then suddenly receives news from Longbourn that her sister Lydia had eloped with Mr. Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy immediately and departs in haste, believing she will never see him again, since Lydia's disgrace has ruined the family's good name.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an agonizing wait, Mr. Wickham is somehow persuaded to marry Lydia. With some degree of decency restored, Lydia visits her family and tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Mrs. Gardiner informs Elizabeth that it is Mr. Darcy who has made the match at great expense, and hints that he may have \\"another motive\\" for doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Shortly thereafter, Bingley proposes to Jane and is accepted. Lady Catherine, having heard rumors that Elizabeth intends to marry Darcy, visits Elizabeth and demands that she promise not to accept his proposal. Elizabeth makes no such promise and Lady Catherine leaves, outraged by Elizabeth's perceived insolence. Darcy, heartened by Elizabeth's refusal to promise that she wouldn't accept such a proposal, again proposes to Elizabeth and is accepted. He visits Longbourn to ask Mr. Bennet for his permission.  Elizabeth wants her father to understand that she is not marrying for money, and it is only after she speaks about Mr. Darcy's true worth that he is happy about the wedding.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany critics take the novel's title as a starting point when analysing the major themes of Pride and Prejudice; however, Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. \\"After the success of Sense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title. It should be pointed out that the qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.\\"[9] Although the phrase \\"pride and prejudice\\" had been used over the preceding two centuries by Joseph Hall, Jeremy Taylor, Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson,[10] Austen probably took her title from a passage in Fanny Burney's Cecilia (1782), a popular novel she is known to have admired:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole of this unfortunate business,\\" said Dr Lyster, \\"has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE?... Yet this, however, remember: if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination?...[11][12] (capitalisation as in the original.)\\r\\n\\r\\nA major theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[13] Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her world, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. In Pride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment; Darcy, on the other hand, has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable, but he is also proud and overbearing.[13] Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[14]  American novelist Anna Quindlen observed, in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:\\r\\n\\r\\nPride and Prejudice is also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in the drawing room making small talk as in the pursuit of a great white whale or the public punishment of adultery.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opening line of the novel famously announces: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\\"[16] This sets marriage as a central subjectand really, a central problemfor the novel generally. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men are, in fact, in want of a wife, or if such desires are dictated by the \\"neighbourhood\\" families and their daughters who require a \\"good fortune\\". Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political economy, and economy more generally, into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, for example, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable economy of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological). The Bennets' marriage is one such example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, will come to re-enact with Wickham, and the results are far from felicitous. Though the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work  to understand each other and themselves so that they can marry each other on compatible terms personally, even if their \\"equal\\" social status remains fraught. When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of only marrying when one is in love is introduced. Elizabeth only accepts Darcy's proposal when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.[17] Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable, especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, companionate attraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney plays a key role in the marriage market, not only for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband, but also for men who wish to marry a woman of means. Two examples are George Wickham, who tried to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam. Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a high family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she declares \\"I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\\"[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nInheritance was by descent, but could be further restricted by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children.[19] The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have a prosperous life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAusten might be known now for her \\"romances,\\" but the marriages that take place in her novels engage with economics and class distinction. Pride and Prejudice is hardly the exception. When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become: \\"Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?\\" Though Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are \\"equals\\"), Lady Catherine refuses to accept Darcy's actual marriage to Elizabeth even as the novel closes.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating social class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes a point to explain that the Bingleys acquired their wealth by trade rather than through the gentry's and aristocracy's methods of inheritance and making money off their tenants as landlords. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall?ÿ it is, after all, \\"to let\\"?ÿ distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family, and who, through his mother, is the grandson and nephew of an Earl. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property, but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentility, like Jane Bennet, ambitious cits (merchant class), etc. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters, and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, there is an undercurrent of the old Anglo-Norman upper class hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh; Fitzwilliam, D'Arcy, de Bourgh (Burke), and even Bennet, are all traditional Norman surnames.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their own faults and work to correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"How despicably have I acted!\\" she cried; \\"I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther characters rarely exhibit this depth of self-reflection?ÿ or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development. Tanner notes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, \\"has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects.\\"[22] Mrs. Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they don't get married: \\"The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\\"[23] This proves that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of \\"material objects\\" and not of her own feelings and emotions.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nPride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's other works, employs the narrative technique of free indirect speech, which has been defined as \\"the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke\\".[25] Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different.[26] By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. \\"The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential?... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.\\"[25] The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character. Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the \\"oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.\\".[6] Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals Free Indirect Discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, Free Indirect Discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nAusten began writing the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[28] It was originally titled First Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797.[29] On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post.[30] The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times.[31] The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAusten made significant revisions to the manuscript for First Impressions between 1811 and 1812.[29] As nothing remains of the original manuscript, we are reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel.[33] She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around about 1811/1812, which she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for S110[34] (equivalent to S6,724 in 2016). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the \\"sufferings and oppositions\\" summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.[13] It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAusten sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for S110 (Austen had asked for S150).[35] This proved a costly decision. Austen had published Sense and Sensibility on a commission basis, whereby she indemnified the publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware that Sense and Sensibility would sell out its edition, making her S140,[30] she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around S450 from just the first two editions of the book.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nEgerton published the first edition of Pride and Prejudice in three hardcover volumes on 27 January 1813.[37] It was advertised in The Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.[29] Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in November that year. A third edition was published in 1817.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nForeign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish.[38] Pride and Prejudice was first published in the United States in August 1832 as Elizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.[35] The novel was also included in Richard Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R W Chapman's scholarly edition of Pride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel was originally published without Austen's name. It was instead written \\"By the Author of Sense and Sensibility\\". This carried responsibility for Austen, unlike when Sense and Sensibility was released as being written \\"By A Lady\\".[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication.[36] Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife of Lord Byron, called it \\"the fashionable novel\\".[36] Noted critic and reviewer George Henry Lewes declared that he \\"would rather have written Pride and Prejudice, or Tom Jones, than any of the Waverley Novels\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlotte Bront?, however, in a letter to Lewes, wrote that Pride and Prejudice was a disappointment, \\"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but?... no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\\".[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAusten for her part thought the \\"playfulness and epigrammaticism\\" of Pride and Prejudice was excessive, complaining in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked \\"shade\\" and should have had a chapter \\"of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the history of Bounapart\\".[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could not shock her more than she shocks me,\\r\\nBeside her Joyce seems innocent as grass.\\r\\nIt makes me most uncomfortable to see\\r\\nAn English spinster of the middle class\\r\\nDescribe the amorous effects of 'brass',\\r\\nReveal so frankly and with such sobriety\\r\\nThe economic basis of society.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe American scholar Claudia Johnson defended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.[42] One critic, Mary Poovey, wrote the \\"romantic conclusion\\" of Pride and Prejudice is an attempt to hedge the conflict between the \\"individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value system and the authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic society\\".[43] Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an \\"escape\\" from conflict.[44] Johnson wrote the \\"outrageous unconventionality\\" of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nPride and Prejudice has engendered numerous adaptations. Some of the notable film versions include that of 1940, starring Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier[55] (based in part on Helen Jerome's 1936 stage adaptation) and that of 2005, starring Keira Knightley (an Oscar-nominated performance) and Matthew Macfadyen.[56] Notable television versions include two by the BBC: a 1980 version starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul and the popular 1995 version, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 1936 stage version was created by Helen Jerome played at the St James's Theatre in London, starring Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams.

The system is essentially free except for small, often symbolic co-payments in some products and services.\\r\\nAccording to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, total health spending accounted for 9.4% of GDP in Spain in 2011, slightly above the OECD average of 9.3%. The Spanish health care system is considered one of the best in the world, in 7th position in the ranking calculated by the World Health Organization.[1] Spain is ranked 1st in the world in organ transplants.[2][3] The public sector is the main source of health funding. In Spain, 73% of health spending was funded by public sources in 2011, very close to the average of 72% in OECD countries. Since 2010, real term spending on healthcare has declined in Spain.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an emergency, people can go straight to a hospital A&E. For any other type of hospital treatment a referral from a doctor is required. There are public and private hospitals, with the former providing free treatment. As some hospitals offer both private and state healthcare services, the presentation of a social security card, an EHIC, or proof of private insurance is advisable. As hospital doctors do not issue prescriptions, after discharge, patients take the hospital medical report to a pharmacy for prescriptions to be filled.\\r\\nIn Spain patients have the right to read their own patient records, but there is evidence that this is not well publicised.[5]\\r\\nIn Spain, provision of health care services is decentralised, and thus the responsibility of several autonomous communities. As of 2001, decentralisation was in effect in: Andalusia, the Canary Islands, Catalunya, Valencia, Navarra, Galicia, and Pais Vasco.[6] In 1998, an analysis of the effects of greater autonomy on legislative performance and policy outcomes for health care observed a positive effect on the former, but no effect on the latter. The analysis noted that a possible explanation for this disconnect was that autonomous communities had only experienced greater autonomy in the area of health care for a short time, and positive effects on policy outcomes could take longer to manifest.[7] In 2009, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish National Health Survey in 2001 showed that autonomous communities with decentralised health services tended to have better equity performance.[6] In 2014, an analysis of data collected by the Spanish Centre of Sociological Research between 1996 and 2009 found that for twenty variables of public satisfaction with health care services, decentralisation not only had no effect on 2 measures of primary or specialised care and 1 of hospital care, but actually performed worse on 3 measures of primary or specialised care and 1 measure of hospital care. No statistically significant trend was observed for twelve of the twenty measures of satisfaction. The authors of the analysis stressed that the data was limited due to the subjective nature of patient reports, and the possible inability of some to properly evaluate performance of health care services.[8]\\r\\nIn a sample of 13 developed countries Spain was second in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in both 2009 and 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that, in the previous 10 years the conditions treated had: a high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality; caused significant long-term morbidity; incurred high levels of expenditure or had significant developments in prevention or treatment. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use.[9] Ceuta had the highest proportion of practising doctors per head of any region in Europe - 871 per 100,000 in 2015.[10]\\r\\nThe Euro health consumer index rated Spain 19th of 35 European countries in 2015, remarking that there was somewhat of an over-reliance on seeking private care.[11]","input":"What type of health care system does spain have?"},{"output":"the 17th century","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant major is a senior non-commissioned rank or appointment in many militaries around the world. In Commonwealth countries, the various degrees of sergeant major are appointments held by warrant officers. In the United States, there are also various grades of sergeant major (command sergeant major, Sergeant Major of the Army, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps), but they are all of the same pay grade of E-9. However, the Sergeant Major of the Army and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, as their respective service's Senior Enlisted Advisor, receive a special rate of basic pay that is higher than all other sergeants major.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 16th century Spain, the sargento mayor (\\"sergeant major\\") was a general officer. He commanded an army's infantry, and ranked about third in the army's command structure; he also acted as a sort of chief of staff to the army's commander.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 17th century, sergeant majors appeared in individual regiments. These were field officers, third in command of their regiments (after their colonels and lieutenant colonels), with a role similar to the older, army-level sergeant majors (although obviously on a smaller scale). The older position became known as \\"sergeant major general\\" to distinguish it. Over time, the term sergeant was dropped from both titles, giving rise to the modern ranks of major and major general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe full title of sergeant major fell out of use until the latter part of the 18th century, when it began to be applied to the senior non-commissioned officer of an infantry battalion or cavalry regiment. It is about this time that the U.S. and British histories of the title diverge, with the American Revolutionary War.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sergeant major is an appointment, not a rank. It is normally held by the senior warrant officer of an army or marine unit. These appointments are made at several levels, for example: the senior warrant officer of a company, battery or squadron; the senior warrant officer of a battalion or regiment. The title normally consists of the unit title (e.g. 'company') followed by 'sergeant major', and abbreviated by the initials (e.g. CSM). A sergeant major of a regiment or battalion is known as a regimental sergeant major, rather than a \\"regiment sergeant major\\" or \\"battalion sergeant major\\". In the Australian Defence Force, in addition to CSMs and RSMs, the most senior warrant officer of the army carries the appointment (and special insignia) of Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sergeant-major of a unit is normally directly responsible to the commanding officer for all matters pertaining to dress, deportment, discipline, conduct, performance, standards and morale of the non-commissioned members (NCMs) of that unit. Sergeant majors are normally addressed as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\" by subordinates, and as \\"sergeant major\\" or by their full title (or its abbreviation) by superiors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the British Armed Forces, the plural is sergeant majors and not sergeants major as it is in the United States.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe appointment of sergeant major is given to the senior non-commissioned member within sub-units, units and some formations of the Canadian Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe regimental sergeant-major is the senior sergeant major in a battalion-sized unit, including infantry battalions and artillery, armoured, engineer, and signal regiments. This appointment is normally held by a chief warrant officer. The same position can also be held by a master warrant officer in anticipation of promotion, or a shortage of available chief warrant officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn company-sized units, the company sergeant-major generally holds the rank of master warrant officer, although in some cases, it may be held by a warrant officer if the company is smaller, or in a shortage of available master warrant officers. In artillery batteries, this appointment is known as battery sergeant-major, while in units with a cavalry heritage (armoured, combat engineer, and signals squadrons), the term is squadron sergeant-major.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn company-sized sub-units of battalions or regiments, the company sergeant-major (or equivalent) normally answers both to his or her officer commanding for matters pertaining to the company in particular, and to the regimental sergeant-major on matters of concern to the regimental sergeant-major. Company sergeant-majors and their equivalents are normally addressed as \\"Sergeant-Major\\" or by rank. By subordinates, they are referred to as \\"Sir\\", \\"Ma'am\\", or \\"Warrant\\" (for warrant officers) as appropriate. \\"CSM\\" (\\"BSM\\", \\"SSM\\") is a title normally reserved for use by the commanding officer.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRegimental sergeant-majors are never addressed as \\"Sergeant-Major\\". They are addressed by rank or as \\"Mr (Surname)\\" or \\"Ms (Surname)\\", and thereafter by subordinates as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\". \\"RSM\\" is reserved for use by the commanding officer.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some unusual cases, a chief petty officer 1st class or chief petty officer 2nd class in the Royal Canadian Navy may succeed to a sergeant-major's position, especially in units with a large number of \\"purple trades\\", such as service battalions. The forms of address generally remain the same, except that chief petty officers 1st and 2nd class are never addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\", but as \\"Chief\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opera Leo, the Royal Cadet (1889) by Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and George Frederick Cameron includes a character \\"Battalion Sergeant Major at the Royal Military College of Canada\\" and song \\"The Royal Cadet - The Battalion Sergeant Major\\". The senior cadet of the Royal Military College of Canada was a battalion sergeant major from 1878ÿ1923 and from 1934ÿ42. Since 1952, however, the senior cadet is known as a cadet wing-commander.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant major is a rank in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While technically it is the 6th level of rank, below corps sergeant major and above staff sergeant major, it, along with the other two, are specialized ranks and not part of the normal progression, which would proceed from staff sergeant to inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\nA sergeant major appointment exists in each military unit from company to division/formation. Their main job is to assist the commander in the discipline and welfare of the enlisted men. Their authority and responsibility at parades and ceremonies extends over even commissioned officers while on the parade square. In the Singapore Armed Forces, two kinds of sergeant major exist, a regimental sergeant major and a company sergeant major. A regimental sergeant major may be placed in charge of a battalion, brigade, division or service level. A regimental sergeant major could also be appointed as RSM for a vocation, i.e. infantry vocation/formation sergeant major. This appointment is usually held by a senior warrant officer or a master warrant officer, although at times a 1st warrant officer may be appointed. A company sergeant major may be a 1WO, 2WO and 3WO. Sometimes, a master sergeant or a staff sergeant may be appointed. Military Experts of rank ME 3 could also be sergeant majors, in-charge of logistical units or naval units. This practice is also mirrored in the National Cadet Corps with the master sergeant or staff sergeant being appointed as unit sergeant major. Also, some schools with more than one unit, i.e. having a land as well as a sea unit, might appointed an RSM from either unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Sri Lanka, the rank of sergeant major exists in the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Police Service. In the army, a warrant officer 2nd class is known as a sergeant major; while a warrant officer 1st class is a regimental sergeant major. In the police, the most senior non-gazetted officer rank is police sergeant major.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs described above, sergeant-major is not a rank, but an appointment held by a warrant officer class 1 or warrant officer class 2. Regardless of the appointment, the warrant officer is addressed as \\"sergeant-major\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank was established in the Union Defence Forces in 1913, in a single class. The rank badge was a crown, senior appointments being indicated by a wreath around the badge.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank was divided into two classes in 1921. The national coat of arms was assigned as the badge of the 1st class, and the crown was assigned to the 2nd class. In both classes, senior appointments were indicated by a wreath around the badge.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1957 to 2002, all warrant officers 1st class wore the wreathed coat of arms, and the warrant officer 2nd class wore the plain coat of arms.[5] Since 2002, all warrant officers have worn the new national coat of arms, the classes and appointments being indicated by the shape of the surrounding frame, and the addition of stars and crossed swords above the arms.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until 1 June 2008, the highest appointment (level 1), that was held by a warrant officer class 1 was the Sergeant-Major of the South African National Defence Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther senior warrant officer appointments up until 1 June 2008 were:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South African Air Force had a similar structure for its warrant officers who are also addressed as \\"sergeant-major\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting 1 June 2008, the warrant ranks (Army/ Navy/ Air Force) are:\\r\\n\\r\\nA company/squadron/battery sergeant major should ordinarily be a WO2.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the British Army and Royal Marines, company/battery/squadron sergeant major is an appointment for a WO2 and regimental sergeant major is a WO1 appointment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to differences in nomenclature between Regiments and Corps sergeant majors' titles do vary; Squadron sergeant major and battery sergeant major for instance would be found in the cavalry and Royal Artillery respectively, and in the REME there are the appointments of artificer sergeant major.\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant major instructor is an appointment held by warrant officers class 1 in the Small Arms School Corps and the Army Physical Training Corps and by some WO1s in the Royal Engineers. It is also an appointment held by some of the civilian adult instructors in the Army Cadet Force.\\r\\n\\r\\nA machinist sergeant-major is a specialist most often found in the Corps of Royal Engineers or the Royal Army Service Corps, and was the title of one of the major characters in the book and the film based on it, Ice Cold in Alex.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the use of \\"sergeant major\\" as a form of address, see the articles on regimental and company sergeant majors, and that on staff sergeants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe posts of regimental and squadron corporal major are the Household Cavalry's equivalent of sergeant majors, as the Household Cavalry traditionally does not have ranks named sergeant. The Rifles use the spelling \\"serjeant major\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a new 'Army Sergeant Major' of the British Army due to the reforms of the British Army.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first British use of the term was around 1680 and was applied to the senior sergeant in the colonel's company of an infantry regiment,[9] but it wasn't formalised until 1797, when the sergeant major was added to the battalion or regimental staff. When chevrons were introduced as badges of rank, he wore four, later under a crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1813, cavalry regiments introduced the troop sergeant major to replace the quartermaster as the senior NCO of a troop; this required the existing position to be explicitly redesignated the regimental sergeant major. Later, the rise of the squadron as the principal sub-regimental unit saw the corresponding introduction of the squadron sergeant major. The infantry, however, hung on to the undifferentiated, one-per-battalion sergeant major until the eve of the First World War, when the introduction of the company sergeant major forced them to adopt the RSM title as well. (As an infantry regiment could be, and usually was, made up of a number of battalions, one would logically expect the new title to be battalion sergeant major rather than regimental sergeant major. Perhaps the infantry felt this would imply a lower status than their cavalry equivalents.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1881, the cavalry RSM and infantry sergeant major were among a number of senior non-commissioned positions that were confirmed with warrants, making them warrant officers. This was extended and rationalised in 1915, with the introduction of the new ranks of warrant officer class I (WOI) and warrant officer class II (WOII). RSM became an appointment of the former, CSM and SSM of the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Marines continued to use a single rank of sergeant major, equating to warrant officer class I, until after the Second World War, when they adopted the Army system.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royal Flying Corps and its successor the Royal Air Force used the ranks of sergeant-major class I and II instead of warrant officer class I and II until the 1930s, when the RAF adopted the Army-style ranks. The RAF has not used sergeant major as either a rank or an appointment since that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, the rank of sergent-major (distinct from the rank of major) was created in 1776. He was the highest ranked non-commissioned officer (French: bas-officier) in the infantry company; the equivalent in the cavalry was the marchal-des-logis-chef. The sergeant-major was charged with the administration of the company. Under the Ancien Regime, the equivalent at the general staff headquarters of the regiment was the adjudant sous-officiers, a rank which was also established in 1776, who was the senior NCO of the regiment.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the reforms of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, it became harder to ascend to the officer corps, due to primarily age restrictions. With the addition of an adjudant (warrant officer) in each company, the sergeant-major became limited to purely administrative functions.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank was replaced with that of sergent-chef in 1928. The rank was re-established from 1942 until 1962 between sergent-chef and adjudant as the NCO in charge of the accounting responsibility of the company. There were no promotions to sergeant-major after 1964 and the rank was formally abolished in 1971. The last NCO to have held the rank retired in 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable soldiers who held the rank of sergeant-major included Marshal of France Fran?ois Achille Bazaine, douard Husband, and Henri Tonel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Indonesian Armed Forces, the rank is known as sersan mayor and is the most senior sergeant rank.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ??-??? ????? (Rav samal mitkadem, \\"sergeant major\\") and the ??-??? ???? ( Rav samal bakhr, \\"command sergeant major\\") are both non-commissioned officers (?????) ranks in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Because the IDF is an integrated force, they have a unique rank structure. IDF ranks are the same in all services (army, navy, air force, etc.). The ranks are derived from those of the paramilitary Haganah developed in the British Mandate of Palestine period to protect the Yishuv. This origin is reflected in the slightly-compacted IDF rank structure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant major insignia(U.S. Army)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCommand sergeant majorrank insignia(U.S. Army)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNominative Senior Enlisted Leader Collar Insignia(U.S. Army)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant major insignia(U.S. Marine Corps)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSergeant Major of the Marine Corps\\r\\ninsignia\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConfederate sergeant major stripes \\r\\nshown in infantry blue pattern\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official U.S. use of the term was in 1776, when a sergeant major was appointed to the headquarters of each infantry battalion (or regiment, the two designations being used interchangeably) of the Continental Army. The original insignia of rank was an epaulette, or strip, of red cloth sewn on each shoulder of the uniform coat. In the years between 1776 and 1851, the sergeant major rank insignia went through several changes until the \\"classic\\" pattern worn during the Civil War and throughout the Indian Wars was adopted. Generally, these styles included either staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) epaulettes, chevrons, or a combination of both. (During this period, the rank insignia for the several SNCO ranks of sergeant major, quartermaster sergeant, drum major, and fife major were identical.) In 1821, SNCOs received a single yellow chevron, point up, above the elbow on each sleeve. (Company grade officers, including the new officer grade of \\"adjutant\\", ranking above captain and below major, and non-commissioned officers or NCOs, viz., sergeants and corporals, all received chevrons of various colors, materials, patterns, and placement as their insignia of rank.) In 1825, the sergeant major chevron insignia was changed to be identical to that of the adjutant, by adding an inverted arc below the chevron (very similar in design to the modern private first class insignia), although in a different color (yellow vice gold or silver) and material (worsted vice lace) than that of the officer rank. In 1832, SNCOs returned to a rank insignia denoted by elaborate epaulettes without the chevrons. All SNCOs and NCOs returned to having chevrons as their rank insignia in 1847, when a completely new system of insignia was introduced. This was the first implementation of the three chevrons over three arcs design (with the chevrons worn point-up) of the \\"traditional\\" sergeant major rank insignia. (The quartermaster finally received a distinctive rank insigniathree chevrons over three horizontal barsand for the first time, the first sergeant, or orderly sergeant, received a distinctive rank insigniathree chevrons surmounting a lozenge.) Finally, in 1851, the Army inverted the SNCO and NCO insignia again to be point-down. (Perrenot, 2011)[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rank was in use by both the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. At that time, it was the highest enlisted rank, being just above quartermaster sergeant. The same rank insignia, three point-down chevrons under three arcs, was used by both armies. Both armies varied the color of the stripes by assigning red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, and blue for infantry. Some Confederate militia units varied these colors even farther and had other colors, including black stripes, for various units.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1920, with the standardization of the army's enlisted pay grades, it ceased to be a title of rank or grade. However, it survived as the job title of the senior NCO of a battalion and was re-introduced as a rank in 1958 when Congress authorized the Eÿ8 and Eÿ9 pay grades (P.L. 85-422, 72 Stat. 122). This new iteration of sergeant major as a discrete grade of rank saw the new rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with a five pointed star between the chevrons and arcs. In that law (as amended), the authorized daily average number of enlisted members on active duty in an armed force in pay grade Eÿ9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 1.25 percent, respectively, of the number of enlisted members of that armed force, subject to certain exceptions.[12]  A new insignia was authorized by DA Message 865848, 28 May 1968, for sergeants major assigned at the principal NCO of battalion and higher level command (viz., command sergeants major). This insignia was the same as the sergeant major insignia except the star was small and a wreath was placed around the star. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe appointment of Sergeant Major of the Army was created on July 4, 1966 and in 1979 received the unique grade of rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with two stars centered between the bottom chevron and the upper arc. In 1994 The insignia for Sergeant Major of the Army was changed to add the Coat of Arms of the United States between the two stars in the center of the insignia. The pin-on insignia is polished gold-plated with a black enamel background.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Marine Corps' first sergeant major was Archibald Sommers, appointed on January 1, 1801. This was originally a solitary post, similar to the modern Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, but by 1899 there were five sergeants major. The title was abolished in 1946, but re-introduced as a rank in 1954. The post of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps was established in 1957, as the senior enlisted advisor to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S. Army, sergeant major (SGM) refers to both a military rank and a personnel slot, or position title. It is the highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant and master sergeant, with a pay grade of Eÿ9, NATO rank ORÿ9.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe leadership variationcommand sergeant major (CSM)is the senior enlisted advisor to the commanding officer. The leadership position carries with it certain ceremonial functions such as caring for the unit's colors (flag). Additionally, CSMs serve as monitors of, and advocates for, the enlisted soldiers in the command. This position mostly exists in units of battalion size and larger.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the CSM represents all of the enlisted soldiers in the command, CSMs assigned to units above brigade do not wear the collar insignia of his or her career specialty (e.g., infantry, quartermaster, intelligence, inter alia), but instead wears the CSM (formerly \\"branch immaterial\\") collar insignia. The insignia is a gold-color rendering of the coat of arms of the United States; like the branch of service insignia of all U.S. Army enlisted soldiers, it is placed upon a gold-colored metal disk, one inch in diameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the SGM and CSM are referred to, and addressed as, \\"Sergeant Major\\". The Sergeant Major of the Army is a separate and unique position, but is still addressed as \\"Sergeant Major\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States Marine Corps, sergeant major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in grade to master gunnery sergeant, although the two have different responsibilities. Sergeant major is both a rank and a military billet. Marine Corps sergeants major serve as the senior enlisted marine in the Corps' units of battalion, squadron or higher echelon, as the unit commander's senior enlisted advisor and to handle matters of discipline and morale among the enlisted marines.

The name \\"canopic\\" reflects the mistaken association by early Egyptologists with the Greek legend of Canopus.[3]\\r\\nCanopic jars of the Old Kingdom were rarely inscribed, and had a plain lid. In the Middle Kingdom inscriptions became more usual, and the lids were often in the form of human heads. By the Nineteenth dynasty each of the four lids depicted one of the four sons of Horus, as guardians of the organs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe canopic jars were four in number, each for the safekeeping of particular human organs: the stomach, intestines, lungs, and liver, all of which, it was believed, would be needed in the afterlife. There was no jar for the heart: the Egyptians believed it to be the seat of the soul, and so it was left inside the body.[n 1]\\r\\nThe design of canopic jars changed over time. The oldest date from the Eleventh or the Twelfth dynasty, and are made of stone or wood.[6] The last jars date from the New Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom the jars had plain lids, though by the First Intermediate Period jars with human heads (assumed to represent the dead) began to appear.[1] Sometimes the covers of the jars were modeled after (or painted to resemble) the head of Anubis, the god of death and embalming. By the late Eighteenth dynasty canopic jars had come to feature the four sons of Horus.[7] Many sets of jars survive from this period, in alabaster, aragonite, calcareous stone, and blue or green glazed porcelain.[6] The sons of Horus were also the gods of the cardinal compass points.[8] Each god was responsible for protecting a particular organ, and was himself protected by a companion goddess. They were:\\r\\nEarly canopic jars were placed inside a canopic chest and buried in tombs together with the sarcophagus of the dead.[6] Later, they were sometimes arranged in rows beneath the bier, or at the four corners of the chamber.[6] After the early periods there were usually inscriptions on the outsides of the jars, sometimes quite long and complex.[10] The scholar Sir Ernest Budge quoted an inscription from the Sa?te or Ptolemaic period that begins: \\"Thy bread is to thee. Thy beer is to thee. Thou livest upon that on which Ra lives.\\" Other inscriptions tell of purification in the afterlife.[11]\\r\\nIn the Third Intermediate Period and later, dummy canopic jars were introduced. Improved embalming techniques allowed the viscera to remain in the body; the traditional jars remained a feature of tombs, but were no longer hollowed out for storage of the organs.[12]\\r\\nCopious numbers of the jars were produced, and surviving examples of them can be seen in museums around the world.","input":"What is a canopic jars of ancient egypt?"},{"output":"assimilation","context":"The melting pot is a monocultural metaphor for a heterogeneous society becoming more homogeneous, the different elements \\"melting together\\" into a harmonious whole with a common culture or vice versa, for a homogeneous society becoming more heterogeneous through the influx of foreign elements with different cultural background with a potential creation of disharmony with the previous culture. Historically, it is often used to describe the assimilation of immigrants to the United States.[1] The melting-together metaphor was in use by the 1780s.[2][3] The exact term \\"melting pot\\" came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe desirability of assimilation and the melting pot model has been reconsidered by proponents of multiculturalism,[4][5] who have suggested alternative metaphors to describe the current American society, such as a mosaic,  salad bowl, or kaleidoscope, in which different cultures mix, but remain distinct in some aspects.[6][7][8] Others argue that cultural assimilation is important to the maintenance of national unity, and should be promoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the metaphor of a \\"crucible\\" or \\"smelting pot\\" was used to describe the fusion of different nationalities, ethnicities and cultures. It was used together with concepts of the United States as an ideal republic and a \\"city upon a hill\\" or new promised land.[citation needed] It was a metaphor for the idealized process of immigration and colonization by which different nationalities, cultures and \\"races\\" (a term that could encompass nationality, ethnicity and race proper) were to blend into a new, virtuous community, and it was connected to utopian visions of the emergence of an American \\"new man\\". While \\"melting\\" was in common use the exact term \\"melting pot\\" came into general usage in 1908, after the premiere of the play The Melting Pot by Israel Zangwill.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first use in American literature of the concept of immigrants \\"melting\\" into the receiving culture are found in the writings of J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur. In his Letters from an American Farmer (1782) Crevecoeur writes, in response to his own question, \\"What then is the American, this new man?\\" that the American is one who \\"leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.  He becomes an American by being received in the broad lap of our great Alma Mater.  Here individuals of all nations are melted into a new race of men, whose labors and posterity will one day cause great changes in the world.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n...whence came all these people? They are a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans, and Swedes... What, then, is the American, this new man? He is either an European or the descendant of an European; hence that strange mixture of blood, which you will find in no other country. I could point out to you a family whose grandfather was an Englishman, whose wife was Dutch, whose son married a French woman, and whose present four sons have now four wives of different nations. He is an American, who, leaving behind him all his ancient prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the new rank he holds.... The Americans were once scattered all over Europe; here they are incorporated into one of the finest systems of population which has ever appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1845, Ralph Waldo Emerson, alluding to the development of European civilization out of the medieval Dark Ages, wrote in his private journal of America as the Utopian product of a culturally and racially mixed \\"smelting pot\\", but only in 1912 were his remarks first published. In his writing, Emerson explicitly welcomed the racial intermixing of whites and non-whites, a highly controversial view during his lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nA magazine article in 1876 used the metaphor explicitly:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fusing process goes on as in a blast-furnace; one generation, a single year eventransforms the English, the German, the Irish emigrant into an American. Uniform institutions, ideas, language, the influence of the majority, bring us soon to a similar complexion; the individuality of the immigrant, almost even his traits of race and religion, fuse down in the democratic alembic like chips of brass thrown into the melting pot.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, historian Frederick Jackson Turner also used the metaphor of immigrants melting into one American culture. In his essay The Significance of the Frontier in American History, he referred to the \\"composite nationality\\" of the American people, arguing that the frontier had functioned as a \\"crucible\\" where \\"the immigrants were Americanized, liberated and fused into a mixed race, English in neither nationality nor characteristics\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his 1905 travel narrative The American Scene, Henry James discusses cultural intermixing in New York City as a \\"fusion, as of elements in solution in a vast hot pot\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact term \\"melting pot\\" came into general usage in the United States after it was used as a metaphor describing a fusion of nationalities, cultures and ethnicities in the 1908 play of the same name, first performed in Washington, D.C., where the immigrant protagonist declared: \\r\\nUnderstand that America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming! Here you stand, good folk, think I, when I see them at Ellis Island, here you stand in your fifty groups, your fifty languages, and histories, and your fifty blood hatreds and rivalries. But you won't be long like that, brothers, for these are the fires of God you've come tothese are fires of God. A fig for your feuds and vendettas! Germans and Frenchmen, Irishmen and Englishmen, Jews and Russiansinto the Crucible with you all! God is making the American.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Melting Pot (1908), Israel Zangwill combined a romantic denouement with an utopian celebration of complete cultural intermixing. The play was an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in New York City. The play's immigrant protagonist David Quixano, a Russian Jew, falls in love with Vera, a fellow Russian immigrant who is Christian. Vera is an idealistic settlement house worker and David is a composer struggling to create an \\"American symphony\\" to celebrate his adopted homeland. Together they manage to overcome the old world animosities that threaten to separate them. But then David discovers that Vera is the daughter of the Tsarist officer who directed the pogrom that forced him to flee Russia. Horrified, he breaks up with her, betraying his belief in the possibility of transcending religious and ethnic animosities. However, unlike Shakespeare's tragedy,  there is a happy ending. At the end of the play the lovers are reconciled.\\r\\n\\r\\nReunited with Vera and watching the setting sun gilding the Statue of Liberty, David Quixano has a prophetic vision: \\"It is the Fires of God round His Crucible. There she lies, the great Melting-PotListen! Can't you hear the roaring and the bubbling? There gapes her mouth, the harbor where a thousand mammoth feeders come from the ends of the world to pour in their human freight\\". David foresees how the American melting pot will make the nation's immigrants transcend their old animosities and differences and will fuse them into one people: \\"Here shall they all unite to build the Republic of Man and the Kingdom of God. Ah, Vera, what is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all\\r\\nraces and nations come to labour and look forward!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nZangwill thus combined the metaphor of the \\"crucible\\" or \\"melting pot\\" with a celebration of the United States as an ideal republic and a new promised land. The prophetic words of his Jewish protagonist against the backdrop of the Statue of Liberty allude to Emma Lazarus's famous poem The New Colossus (1883), which celebrated the statue as a symbol of American democracy and its identity as an immigrant nation.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nZangwill concludes his play by wishing, \\"Peace, peace, to all ye unborn millions, fated to fill this giant continentthe God of our children give you Peace.\\" Expressing his hope that through this forging process the \\"unborn millions\\" who would become America's future citizens would become a unified nation at peace with itself despite its ethnic and religious diversity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of immigrants to the United States, the \\"melting pot\\" process has been equated with Americanization, that is, cultural assimilation and acculturation. The \\"melting pot\\" metaphor implies both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities, yet cultural assimilation or acculturation can also occur without intermarriage. Thus African-Americans are fully culturally integrated into American culture and institutions. Yet more than a century after the abolition of slavery, intermarriage between African-Americans and other ethnicities is much less common than between different white ethnicities, or between white and Asian ethnicities. Intermarriage between whites and non-whites, and especially African-Americans, was a taboo in the United States for a long time, and was illegal in many US states (see anti-miscegenation laws) until 1967.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe melting pot theory of ethnic relations, which sees American identity as centered upon the acculturation or assimilation and the intermarriage of white immigrant groups, has been analyzed by the emerging academic field of whiteness studies. This discipline examines the \\"social construction of whiteness\\" and highlights the changing ways in which whiteness has been normative to American national identity from the 17th to the 20th century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, European immigration to the United States became increasingly diverse and increased substantially in numbers. Beginning in the 1890s, large numbers of Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups such as the Italians, Jews, and Poles arrived. Many returned to Europe but those who remained merged into the cultural melting pot, adopting American lifestyles.[14] By contrast, Chinese arrivals met intense hostility and  new laws in the 1880s tried to exclude them, but many arrived illegally. Hostility forced them into \\"Chinatowns\\" or ethnic enclaves in the larger cities, where they lived a culture apart and seldom assimilated. The acquisition of Hawaii in 1898, with full citizenship for the residents of all races, greatly increased the Asian American population.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the meaning of the recently popularized concept of the melting pot was subject to ongoing debate which centered on the issue of immigration. The debate surrounding the concept of the melting pot centered on how immigration impacted American society and on how immigrants should be approached. The melting pot was equated with either the acculturation or the total assimilation of European immigrants, and the debate centered on the differences between these two ways of approaching immigration: \\"Was the idea to melt down the immigrants and then pour the resulting, formless liquid into the preexisting cultural and social molds modeled on Anglo-Protestants like Henry Ford and Woodrow Wilson, or was the idea instead that everyone, Mayflower descendants and Sicilians, Ashkenazi and Slovaks, would act chemically upon each other so that all would be changed, and a new compound would emerge?\\"[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nNativists wanted to severely restrict access to the melting pot. They felt that far too many \\"undesirables,\\" or in their view, culturally inferior immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe had already arrived. The compromises that were reached in a series of immigration laws in the 1920s established the principle that the number of new arrivals should be small, and, apart from family reunification, the inflow of new immigrants should match the ethnic profile of the nation as it existed at that time.[15]  National quotas were established that discouraged immigration from Poland, Italy and Russia, and encouraged immigration from Britain, Ireland and Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntermarriage between Euro-American men and Native American women has been common since colonial days. In the 21st century some 7.5 million Americans claim Native American ancestry.[16]  In the 1920s the nation welcomed celebrities of Native American background, especially Will Rogers and Jim Thorpe, as well as Vice President Charles Curtis, who had been brought up on a reservation and identified with his Indian heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mixing of whites and blacks, resulting in multiracial children, for which the term \\"miscegenation\\" was coined in 1863, was a taboo, and most whites opposed marriages between whites and blacks. In many states, marriage between whites and non-whites was even prohibited by state law through anti-miscegenation laws. As a result, two kinds of \\"mixture talk\\" developed:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the new wordmiscegenationbecame associated with black-white mixing, a preoccupation of the years after the Civil War, the residual European immigrant aspect of the question of [ethnoracial mixture] came to be more than ever a thing apart, discussed all the more easily without any reference to the African-American aspect of the question. This separation of mixture talk into two discourses facilitated, and was in turn reinforced by, the process Matthew Frye Jacobson has detailed whereby European immigrant groups became less ambiguously white and more definitely \\"not black\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the early 21st century, many white Americans celebrated the impact of African-American culture, especially in sports and music. Marriages between white Americans and African-Americans were still problematic in both communities. Israel Zangwill saw this coming in the early 20th century: \\"However scrupulously and justifiably America avoids intermarriage with the negro, the comic spirit cannot fail to note spiritual miscegenation which, while clothing, commercializing, and Christianizing the ex-African, has given 'rag-time' and the sex-dances that go with it, first to white America and then to the whole white world.\\"[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhite Americans long regarded some elements of African-American culture quintessentially \\"American\\", while at the same time treating African Americans as second-class citizens. White appropriation, stereotyping and mimicking of black culture played an important role in the construction of an urban popular culture in which European immigrants could express themselves as Americans, through such traditions as blackface, minstrel shows and later in jazz and in early Hollywood cinema, notably in The Jazz Singer (1927).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalyzing the \\"racial masquerade\\" that was involved in creation of a white \\"melting pot\\" culture through the stereotyping and imitation of black and other non-white cultures in the early 20th century, historian Michael Rogin has commented: \\"Repudiating 1920s nativism, these films [Rogin discusses The Jazz Singer, Old San Francisco (1927), Whoopee! (1930), King of Jazz (1930) celebrate the melting pot. Unlike other racially stigmatized groups, white immigrants can put on and take off their mask of difference. But the freedom promised immigrants to make themselves over points to the vacancy, the violence, the deception, and the melancholy at the core of American self-fashioning\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nSince World War II, the idea of the melting pot has become more racially inclusive in the United States, gradually extending also to acceptance of marriage between whites and non-whites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis trend towards greater acceptance of ethnic and racial minorities was evident in popular culture in the combat films of World War II, starting with Bataan (1943). This film celebrated solidarity and cooperation between Americans of all races and ethnicities through the depiction of a multiracial American unit. At the time blacks and Japanese in the armed forces were still segregated, while Chinese and Indians were in integrated units.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorian Richard Slotkin sees Bataan and the combat genre that sprang from it as the source of the \\"melting pot platoon\\", a cinematic and cultural convention symbolizing in the 1940s \\"an American community that did not yet exist\\", and thus presenting an implicit protest against racial segregation. However, Slotkin points out that ethnic and racial harmony within this platoon is predicated upon racist hatred for the Japanese enemy: \\"the emotion which enables the platoon to transcend racial prejudice is itself a virulent expression of racial hatred...The final heat which blends the ingredients of the melting pot is rage against an enemy which is fully dehumanized as a race of 'dirty monkeys.'\\" He sees this racist rage as an expression of \\"the unresolved tension between racialism and civic egalitarianism in American life\\".[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hawaii, as Rohrer (2008) argues, there are two dominant discourses of racial politics, both focused on \\"haole\\" (white people or whiteness in Hawaii) in the islands. The first is the discourse of racial harmony representing Hawaii as an idyllic racial paradise with no conflict or inequality. There is also a competing discourse of discrimination against nonlocals, which contends that \\"haoles\\" and nonlocal people of color are disrespected and treated unfairly in Hawaii. As negative referents for each other, these discourses work to reinforce one another and are historically linked. Rohrer proposes that the question of racial politics be reframed toward consideration of the processes of racialization themselvestoward a new way of thinking about racial politics in Hawaii that breaks free of the not racist/racist dyad.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the history of the modern Olympic Games, the theme of the United States as a melting pot has been employed to explain American athletic success, becoming an important aspect of national self-image. The diversity of American athletes in the Olympic Games in the early 20th century was an important avenue for the country to redefine a national culture amid a massive influx of immigrants, as well as American Indians (represented by Jim Thorpe in 1912) and blacks (represented by Jesse Owens in 1936). In the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, two black American athletes with gold and bronze medals saluted the U.S. national anthem with a \\"Black Power\\" salute that symbolized rejection of assimilation.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international aspect of the games allowed the United States to define its pluralistic self-image against the monolithic traditions of other nations. American athletes served as cultural ambassadors of American exceptionalism, promoting the melting pot ideology and the image of America as a progressive nation based on middle-class culture. Journalists and other American analysts of the Olympics framed their comments with patriotic nationalism, stressing that the success of U.S. athletes, especially in the high-profile track-and-field events, stemmed not from simple athletic prowess but from the superiority of the civilization that spawned them.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City strongly revived the melting pot image, returning to a bedrock form of American nationalism and patriotism. The reemergence of Olympic melting pot discourse was driven especially by the unprecedented success of African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans in events traditionally associated with Europeans and white North Americans such as speed skating and the bobsled.[21] The 2002 Winter Olympics was also a showcase of American religious freedom and cultural tolerance of the history of Utah's large majority population of Mormons, as well representation of Muslim Americans and other religious groups in the U.S. Olympic team.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of multiculturalism was preceded by the concept of cultural pluralism, which was first developed in the 1910s and 1920s, and became widely popular during the 1940s. The concept of cultural pluralism first emerged in the 1910s and 1920s among intellectual circles out of the debates in the United States over how to approach issues of immigration and national identity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe First World War heightened tensions between Anglo-American and German-Americans. The war and the Russian Revolution, which caused a \\"Red Scare\\" in the US, which also fanned feelings of xenophobia. During and immediately after the First World War, the concept of the melting pot was equated by Nativists with complete cultural assimilation towards an Anglo-American norm (\\"Anglo-conformity\\") on the part of immigrants, and immigrants who opposed such assimilation were accused of disloyalty to the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly popularized concept of the melting pot was frequently equated with \\"Americanization\\", meaning cultural assimilation, by many \\"old stock\\" Americans. In Henry Ford's Ford English School (established in 1914), the graduation ceremony for immigrant employees involved symbolically stepping off an immigrant ship and passing through the melting pot, entering at one end in costumes designating their nationality and emerging at the other end in identical suits and waving American flags.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition to the absorption of million of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was especially strong among such popular writers Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard, who believed in the \\"racial\\" superiority of Americans of Northern European descent as member of the \\"Nordic race\\", and therefore demanded immigration restrictions to stop a \\"degeneration\\" of America's white racial \\"stock\\". They believed that complete cultural assimilation of the immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was not a solution to the problem of immigration because intermarriage with these immigrants would endanger the racial purity of Anglo-America. The controversy over immigration faded away after immigration restrictions were put in place with the enactment of the Johnson-Reed Act in 1924.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn response to the pressure exerted on immigrants to culturally assimilate and also as a reaction against the denigration of the culture of non-Anglo white immigrants by Nativists, intellectuals on the left such as Horace Kallen, in Democracy Versus the Melting-Pot (1915), and Randolph Bourne, in Trans-National America (1916), laid the foundations for the concept of cultural pluralism. This term was coined by Kallen.[26] Randolph Bourne, who objected to Kallen's emphasis on the inherent value of ethnic and cultural difference, envisioned a \\"trans-national\\" and cosmopolitan America. The concept of cultural pluralism was popularized in the 1940s by John Dewey.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, where the term melting pot is still commonly used, the ideas of cultural pluralism and multiculturalism have, in some circles, taken precedence over the idea of assimilation.[27][28][29] Alternate models where immigrants retain their native cultures such as the \\"salad bowl\\"[30] or the \\"symphony\\"[27] are more often used by sociologists to describe how cultures and ethnicities mix in the United States. Nonetheless, the term assimilation is still used to describe the ways in which immigrants and their descendants adapt, such as by increasingly using the national language of the host society as their first language.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the 1960s, much research in Sociology and History has disregarded the melting pot theory for describing interethnic relations in the United States and other counties.[27][28][29] The theory of multiculturalism offers alternative analogies for ethnic interaction including salad bowl theory, or, as it is known in Canada, the cultural mosaic. In the 1990s, political correctness in the United States emphasized that each ethnic and national group has the right to maintain and preserve its cultural distinction and integrity, and that one does not need to assimilate or abandon one's heritage in order to blend in or merge into the majority Anglo-American society.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, some prominent scholars, such as Samuel P. Huntington in Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity, have expressed the view that the most accurate explanation for modern-day United States culture and inter-ethnic relations can be found somewhere in a fusion of some of the concepts and ideas contained in the melting pot, assimilation, and Anglo-conformity models. Under this theory, it is asserted that the United States has one of the most homogeneous cultures of any nation in the world. This line of thought holds that this American national culture derived most of its traits and characteristics from early colonial settlers from Britain, Ireland, and Germany. When more recent immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe brought their various cultures to America at the beginning of the 20th century, they changed the American cultural landscape just very slightly, and, for the most part, assimilated into America's pre-existing culture which had its origins in Northwestern Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decision of whether to support a melting-pot or multicultural approach has developed into an issue of much debate within some countries. For example, the French and British governments and populace are currently debating whether Islamic cultural practices and dress conflict with their attempts to form culturally unified countries.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nMexico has seen a variety of cultural influences over the years, and in its history has adopted a mixed assimilationist/multiculturalist policy. Mexico, beginning with the conquest of the Aztecs, had entered a new global empire based on trade and immigration. In the 16th and 17th centuries, waves of Spanish, and to a lesser extent, African and Filipino culture became embedded into the fabric of Mexican culture. It is important to note, however, that from a Mexican standpoint, the immigrants and their culture were no longer considered foreign, but Mexican in their entirety. The food, art, and even heritage were assimilated into a Mexican identity. Upon the independence of Mexico, Mexico began receiving immigrants from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, again, bringing many cultural influences but being quickly labeled as Mexican, unlike in the United States, where other culture is considered foreign. This assimilation is very evident, even in Mexican society today: for example, banda, a style of music originating in northern Mexico, is simply a Mexican take on Central European music brought by immigrants in the 18th century. Mexico's thriving beer industry was also the result of German brewers finding refuge in Mexico. Many famous Mexicans are actually of Arab descent; Salma Hayek and Carlos Slim. The coastal states of Guerrero and Veracruz are inhabited by citizens of African descent. Mexico's national policy is based on the concept of mestizaje, a word meaning \\"to mix\\". The immigrants are socially under pressure to adopt a Mexican nationality and become part of the broader culture (speaking Spanish, respect the Catholic heritage, help the society), while contributing useful cultural traits foreign to Mexican society.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Singapore, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[32] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of newer settlement like Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and The United Kingdom;[33][34] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost Argentines are descended from colonial-era settlers and of the 19th and 20th century immigrants from Europe. An estimated 8% of the population is Mestizo, and a further 4% of Argentines are of Arab (in Argentina the Arab ethnicity is considered among the White people, just like in the US Census) or Asian heritage.[35] In the last national census, based on self-identification, 600,000 Argentines (1.6% of the population) declared to be Amerindians[36] Although various genetic tests show that in average, Argentines have 20 to 30% indigenous ancestry, which leads many who are culturally European, to identify as white, even though they are genetically mestizo. Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled, although half ended up returning to Europe or settling in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy mostly, but to a lesser extent, Germany, France, and Russia. Small communities also descend from Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and several other regions.\\r\\n\\r\\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;[37]\\r\\nMany Argentines have the gentilic of an Italian city, place, street or occupation of the immigrant as last name, many of them were not necessarily born Italians, but once they did the roles of immigration from Italy the name usually changed. Spanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.[38][39]\\r\\nMillions of immigrants also came from France (notably Barn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom.[40] The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as Y Wladfa, began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Surez, southern Buenos Aires Province.[41] Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers.[42] The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nBrazil has long been a melting pot for a wide range of cultures. From colonial times Portuguese Brazilians have favoured assimilation and tolerance for other peoples, and intermarriage was more acceptable in Brazil than in most other European colonies. However, Brazilian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. Brazilians of mainly European descent (Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Austrian, Spanish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Lithuanian, Hungarian etc.) account for more than half the population, although people of mixed ethnic backgrounds form an increasingly larger segment; roughly two-fifths of the total are mulattoes (mulattos; people of mixed African and European ancestry) and mestizos (mesti?os, or caboclos; people of mixed European and Indian ancestry). Portuguese are the main European ethnic group in Brazil, and most Brazilians can trace their ancestry to an ethnic Portuguese or a mixed-race Portuguese. Among European descendants, Brazil has the largest Italian diaspora, the second largest German diaspora, as well as other European groups. The country is also home to the largest Japanese diaspora outside Japan, the largest Arab community outside the Arab World and one of the top 10 Jewish populations.\\r\\n\\r\\nColombia is a melting pot of races and ethnicities. The population is descended from three racial groupsNative Americans, blacks, and whitesthat have mingled throughout the nearly 500 years of the country's history. No official figures were available, since the Colombian government dropped any references to race in the census after 1918, but according to rough estimates in the late 1980s, mestizos (white and Native American mix) constituted approximately 50% of the population, whites (predominantly Spanish origin, Italian, German, French, etc.) made a 25%, mulattoes (black-white mix) 14% and zambos  (black and Native American mix) 4%, blacks (pure or predominantly of African origin) 3% percent, and Native Americans 1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nCosta Rican people is a very syncretic melting pot, because this country has been constituted in percentage since the 16th century by immigrants from all the European countries mostly Spaniards and Italians with a lot of Germans, British, Swedes, Swiss, French and Croats also as black people from Africa and Jamaica, Americans, Chinese, Lebanese and Latin Americans who have mestized over time with the large native populations creating the national average modern ethnic composition.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays a great part of the Costa Rican habitants are considered white (83.6%), with minoritaries groups of mulato (6.7%), indigenous (2.4%), Chinese (2%) and black (1.1%). Also, over 9% of the total population is foreign-born (specially from Nicaragua).[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Asia has a long history of inter-ethnic marriage dating back to ancient history. Various groups of people have been intermarrying for millennia in South Asia, including speakers of Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Austroasiatic, and Tibeto-Burman languages.  On account of such diverse influences, South Asia in a nut-shell appears to be a cradle of human civilization. Despite invasions in its recent history it has succeeded in organically assimilating incoming influences, blunting their wills for imperialistic hegemony and maintaining its strong roots and culture. These invasions however brought their own racial mixing between diverse populations and South Asia is considered an exemplary \\"melting pot\\" (and not a \\"salad bowl\\") by many geneticists for exactly this reason. However, South Asian society has never been completely free of ethnic strife and exploitation, and some groups have chosen to remain separate from mainstream social life. The divisiveness of the caste system in India has permeated to every facet of the society. Ethnic conflicts in Pakistan between Baloch, Pashtun, Punjabis, and Sindhis, are other impediments to the melting pot thesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfghanistan seems to be in the process of becoming a melting pot, as customs specific to particular ethnic groups are becoming summarily perceived as national traits of Afghanistan. The term Afghan was originally used to refer to the Pashtuns in the Middle Ages, and the intention behind the creation of the Afghan state was originally to be a Pashtun state, but later this policy changed, leading to the inclusion of non-Pashtuns in the state as Afghans. Today in Afghanistan, the development of a cultural melting pot is occurring, where different Afghanistan ethnic groups are mixing together to build a new Afghan ethnicity composed of preceding ethnicities in Afghanistan today, ultimately replacing the old Pashtun identity which stood for Afghan. With the churning growth of Persian, many ethnic groups, including de-tribalized Pashtuns, are adopting Dari Persian as their new native tongue. Many ethnic groups in Afghanistan tolerate each other, while the HazaraÿPashtun conflict was notable, and often claimed as a Shia-Sunni conflict instead of an ethnic conflict, as this conflict was carried out by the Taliban. The Taliban, which are mostly ethnically Pashtun, have spurred Anti-Pashtunism across non-Pashtun Afghans. PashtunÿTajik rivalries have lingered about, but are much more mild. Reasons for this antipathy are criticism of Tajiks (for either their non-tribal culture or cultural rivalry in Afghanistan) by Pashtuns and criticism of Taliban (mostly composed of Pashtuns) by Tajiks. There have been rivalries between Pashtuns and Uzbeks as well, which is likely very similar to the Kyrgyzstan Crisis, which Pashtuns would likely take place as Kyrgyz (for having a similar nomadic culture), rivaling with Tajiks and Uzbeks (of sedentary culture), despite all being Sunni Muslims.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years of the state of Israel, the term melting pot (??? ?????), also known as \\"Ingathering of the Exiles\\" (????? ??????), was not a description of a process, but an official governmental doctrine of assimilating the Jewish immigrants that originally came from varying cultures (see Jewish ethnic divisions).  This was performed on several levels, such as educating the younger generation (with the parents not having the final say) and (to mention an anecdotal one) encouraging and sometimes forcing the new citizens to adopt a Hebrew name.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivists such as the Iraq-born Ella Shohat that an elite which developed in the early 20th century, out of the earlier-arrived Zionist Pioneers of the Second and Third Aliyas (immigration waves)and who gained a dominant position in the Yishuv (pre-state community) since the 1930shad formulated a new Hebrew culture, based on the values of Socialist Zionism, and imposed it on all later arrivals, at the cost of suppressing and erasing these later immigrants' original culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nProponents of the Melting Pot policy asserted that it applied to all newcomers to Israel equally; specifically, that Eastern European Jews were pressured to discard their Yiddish-based culture as ruthlessly as Mizrahi Jews were pressured to give up the culture which they developed during centuries of life in Arab and Muslim countries. Critics respond, however, that a cultural change effected by a struggle within the Ashkenazi-East European community, with younger people voluntarily discarding their ancestral culture and formulating a new one, is not parallel to the subsequent exporting and imposing of this new culture on others, who had no part in formulating it. Also, it was asserted that extirpating the Yiddish culture had been in itself an act of oppression only compounding what was done to the Mizrahi immigrants.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday the reaction to this doctrine is ambivalent; some say that it was a necessary measure in the founding years, while others claim that it amounted to cultural oppression.[46] Others argue that the melting pot policy did not achieve its declared target: for example, the persons born in Israel are more similar from an economic point of view to their parents than to the rest of the population.[47] The policy is generally not practised today though as there is less need for thatthe mass immigration waves at Israel's founding have declined. Nevertheless, one fifth of current Israel's Jewish population have immigrated from former Soviet Union in the last two decades.[when?] The Jewish population includes other minorities such as Haredi Jews; Furthermore, 20% of Israel's population is Arab. These factors as well as others contribute to the rise of pluralism as a common principle in the last years.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready the Kievan Rus was a multi ethnic state where different ethnicities merged, including Slavs, Finns, Turks and Balts.[48]\\r\\nLater the expansion of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and later of the Russian Empire throughout 15th to 20th centuries created a unique melting pot. Though the majority of Russians had Slavic-speaking ancestry, different ethnicities were assimilated into the Russian melting pot through the period of expansion. Assimilation was a way for ethnic minorities to advance their standing within the Russian society and stateas individuals or groups. It required adoption of Russian as a day-to-day language and Orthodox Christianity as religion of choice. The Roman Catholics (as in Poland and Lithuania) generally resisted assimilation. Throughout the centuries of eastward expansion of Russia  Finno-Ugric and Turkic peoples were assimilated and included into the emerging Russian nation. This includes Mordvin, Udmurt, Mari, Tatar, Chuvash, Bashkir, and others. Surnames of many of Russia's nobility (including Suvorov, Kutuzov, Yusupov, etc.) suggest their Turkic origin.[citation needed] Groups of later, 18th- and 19th-century migrants to Russia, from Europe (Germans, French, Italians, Poles, Serbs, Bulgarians, Greeks, Jews, etc.) or the Caucasus (Georgians, Armenians, Ossetians, Chechens, Azeris and Turks among them) also assimilated within several generations after settling among Russians in the expanding Russian Empire.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Soviet people (Russian: Ѿ־Ҷҳ Ѿ) was an ideological epithet for the population of the Soviet Union. The Soviet government promoted the doctrine of assimilating all peoples living in USSR into one Soviet people, accordingly to Marxist principle of Fraternity of peoples.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effort lasted for the entire history of the Soviet Union, but did not succeed, as evidenced by developments in most national cultures in the territory after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term has been used to describe a number of countries in Southeast Asia. Given the region's location and importance to trade routes between China and the Western world, certain countries in the region have become ethnically diverse.[50] In Vietnam, a relevant phenomenon is \\"tam gio ??ng nguyn\\", meaning the co-existence and co-influence of three major religious teaching schools (Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism), which shows a process defined as \\"cultural addivity\\".[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the pre-Spanish era the Philippines was the trading nexus of various cultures and eventually became the melting pot of different nations. This primarily consisted of the Chinese, Indian and Arab traders; followed by the Japanese, Koreans, and various Middle Eastern countries. This is also includes neighboring southeast Asian cultures. The cultures and races mixed with indigenous tribes, mainly of Austronesian descent (i.e. the Indonesians, Malays and Brunei) and the Negritos. The result was a mix of cultures and ideals. This melting pot of culture continued with the arrival of Europeans, mixing their western culture with the nation. The Spanish Empire colonized the Philippines for more than three centuries, and during the early 20th century, was colonized and annexed by the United States and occupied by the Empire of Japan during World War II. In modern times, the Philippines has been the place of many retired Americans, Japanese expatriates and Korean students. And continues to uphold its status as a melting pot state today.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan is the most composite of all creatures.... Well, as in the old burning of the Temple at Corinth, by the melting and intermixture of silver and gold and other metals a new compound more precious than any, called Corinthian brass, was formed; so in this continentasylum of all nationsthe energy of Irish, Germans, Swedes, Poles, and Cossacks, and all the European tribesof the Africans, and of the Polynesianswill construct a new race, a new religion, a new state, a new literature, which will be as vigorous as the new Europe which came out of the smelting-pot of the Dark Ages, or that which earlier emerged from the Pelasgic and Etruscan barbarism.\\r\\nNo reverberatory effect of The Great War has caused American public opinion more solicitude than the failure of the 'melting-pot.' The discovery of diverse nationalistic feelings among our great alien population has come to most people as an intense shock.\\r\\nBlacks, Chinese, Puerto Ricans, etcetera, could not melt into the pot. They could be used as wood to produce the fire for the pot, but they could not be used as material to be melted into the pot.[54]","input":"What process is the central idea behind americas melting pot?"},{"output":"U.S. Environmental Protection Agency","context":"The Clean Water Act (CWA) is the primary federal law in the United States governing water pollution. Its objective is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters by preventing point and nonpoint pollution sources, providing assistance to publicly owned treatment works for the improvement of wastewater treatment, and maintaining the integrity of wetlands. It is one of the United States' first and most influential modern environmental laws. As with many other major U.S. federal environmental statutes, it is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in coordination with state governments. Its implementing regulations are codified at 40 C.F.R. Subchapters D, N, and O (Parts 100-140, 401-471, and 501-503).\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnically, the name of the law is the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.[2] The first FWPCA was enacted in 1948, but took on its modern form when completely rewritten in 1972 in an act entitled the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972.[3][1] Major changes have subsequently been introduced via amendatory legislation including the Clean Water Act of 1977[4] and the Water Quality Act of 1987.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clean Water Act does not directly address groundwater contamination. Groundwater protection provisions are included in the Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Superfund act.\\r\\n\\r\\nContamination of drinking water supplies can not only occur in the source water but also in the distribution system. Sources of water contamination include naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices (fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer overflows or wastewater releases. Some examples of health implications of water contamination are gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nGastrointestinal disorders include such conditions as constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, perianal abscesses, anal fistulas, perianal infections, diverticular diseases, colitis, colon polyps and cancer.[7] In general, children and the elderly are at highest risk for gastrointestinal disease. In a study investigating the association between drinking water quality and gastrointestinal illness in the elderly of Philadelphia, scientists found water quality 9 to 11 days before the visit was negatively associated with hospital admissions for gastrointestinal illness, with an interquartile range increase in turbidity being associated with a 9% increase). The association was stronger in those over 75 than in the population aged 65ÿ74. This example is a small reflection of residents of the United States remain at risk of waterborne gastrointestinal illness under current water treatment practices.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nReproductive problems refer to any illness of the reproductive system. New research by Brunel University and the University of Exeter strengthens the relationship between water pollution and rising male fertility problems. Study identified a group of chemicals that act as anti-androgens in polluted water, which inhibits the function of the male hormone, testosterone, reducing male fertility.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nNeurological disorders are diseases of the brain, spine and the nerves that connect them. The new study of more than 700 people in Californias Central Valley found that those who likely consumed contaminated private well water had a higher rate of Parkinsons. The risk was 90 percent higher for those who had private wells near fields sprayed with widely used insecticides. Unlike water supplies in large cities, private wells are mostly unregulated and are not monitored for contaminants. Many of them exist at shallow depths of less than 20 yards, and some of the crop chemicals used to kill pests and weeds can flow into ground water. Therefore, private wells are likely to contain pesticides, which can attack developing brains (womb or infancy), leading to neurological diseases later in life. A study led by UCLA epidemiology professor Beate Ritz suggests that \\"people with Parkinsons were more likely to have consumed private well water, and had consumed it on average 4.3 years longer than those who did not have the disease.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll waters with a \\"significant nexus\\" to \\"navigable waters\\" are covered under the CWA; however, the phrase \\"significant nexus\\" remains open to judicial interpretation and considerable controversy. The 1972 statute frequently uses the term \\"navigable waters\\" but also defines the term as \\"waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\\"[11] Some regulations interpreting the 1972 law have included water features such as intermittent streams, playa lakes, prairie potholes, sloughs and wetlands as \\"waters of the United States.\\" In 2006, in Rapanos v. United States, a plurality of the US Supreme Court held that the term \\"waters of the United States\\" \\"includes only those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water 'forming geographic features' that are described in ordinary parlance as 'streams[,]... oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.'\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CWA introduced the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which is a permit system for regulating point sources of pollution.[12] Point sources include:\\r\\n\\r\\nPoint sources may not discharge pollutants to surface waters without a permit from the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). That system is managed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in partnership with state environmental agencies. EPA has authorized 46 states to issue permits directly to the discharging facilities. The CWA also allows tribes to issue permits, but no tribes have been authorized by EPA. In the remaining states and territories, the permits are issued by an EPA regional office.\\r\\n[14] (See Titles III and IV.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn previous legislation, Congress had authorized states to develop water quality standards, which would limit discharges from facilities based on the characteristics of individual water bodies. However, those standards were to be developed only for interstate waters, and the science to support that process (i.e. data, methodology) was in the early stages of development. That system was not effective, and there was no permit system in place to enforce the requirements. In the 1972 CWA, Congress added the permit system and a requirement for technology-based effluent limitations.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1972 CWA created a new requirement for technology-based standards for point source discharges. The EPA develops those standards for categories of dischargers, based on the performance of pollution control technologies without regard to the conditions of a particular receiving water body. The intent of Congress was to create a \\"level playing field\\" by establishing a basic national discharge standard for all facilities within a category, using a \\"Best Available Technology.\\" The standard becomes the minimum regulatory requirement in a permit. If the national standard is not sufficiently protective at a particular location, then water quality standards may be employed.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1972 act authorized continued use of the water quality-based approach, but in coordination with the technology-based standards. After application of technology-based standards to a permit, if water quality is still impaired for the particular water body, then the permit agency (state or EPA) may add water quality-based limitations to that permit. The additional limitations are to be more stringent than the technology-based limitations and would require the permittee to install additional controls. Water quality standards consist of four basic elements: 1) Designated uses; 2) Water quality criteria; 3) Antidegradation policy and 4) General policies.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to water quality standard regulations, federally recognized tribes/nations and states are required to specify appropriate water uses. Identification of appropriate water uses takes into consideration the usage and value of public water supply, protection of fish, wildlife, recreational waters, agricultural, industrial and navigational water ways. Suitability of a water body is examined by states and tribes/nations usages based on physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. States and tribes/nations also examine geographical settings, scenic qualities and economic considerations to determine fitness of designated uses for water bodies. If those standards indicate designated uses to be less than those currently attained, states or tribes are required to revise standards to reflect the uses thaf are actually being attained. For any body of water with designated uses that do not include \\"fishable/swimmable\\" target use that is identified in section 101(a)(2) of CWA, a \\"Use Attainability Analysis\\" must be conducted. Every three years, such bodies of water must be re-examined to verify if new information is available that demand a revision of the standard. If new information is available that specify fishable/swimmable uses can be attained, the use must be designated.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nFederally recognized Indigenous Nations and states protect designated areas by adopting water quality criteria that allow them to adopt the criteria that the EPA publishes under 304(a) of the CWA, modify the 304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopt criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as basis for limiting toxicity of waste discharge to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment; and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater quality standards consist of an anti-degradation policy that requires states and tribes to establish a three-tiered anti-degradation program. Anti-degradation procedures identify steps and questions that need to be addressed when specific activities affect water quality. Tier 1 is applicable to all surface waters. It maintains and protects current uses and water quality conditions to support existing uses. Current uses are identified by showing that fishing, swimming, and other water uses have occurred and are suitable since November 28, 1975. Tier 2 maintains and protects water bodies with existing conditions that are better to support CWA 101(a)(2) \\"fishable/swimmable\\" uses. Tier 3 maintains and protects water quality in outstanding national resource waters (ONRWs), which are the highest quality waters in the US with ecological significance.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates and Indian tribes adopt general policies pertaining to water quality standards that are subject to review and approval by the EPA. Those provisions on water quality standards include mixing zones, variance, and low flow policies. Mixing zone policy is defined area surrounding a point source discharge where sewage is diluted by water. Methodology of mixing zone procedure determines the location, size, shape and quality of mixing zones. Variance policy temporarily relax water quality standard and are alternatives to removing a designated use. States and tribes may include variance as part of their water quality standard. Variance is subject to public review every three years and warrant development towards improvement of water quality. Low Flow policy pertains to states and tribes water quality standards that identify procedures applied to determining critical low flow conditions.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress exempted some water pollution sources from the point source definition in the 1972 CWA and was unclear on the status of some other sources. Such sources were therefore considered to be nonpoint sources that were not subject to the permit program.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgricultural stormwater discharges and irrigation return flows were specifically exempted from permit requirements.[19] Congress, however, provided support for research, technical and financial assistance programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to improve runoff management practices on farms. See Natural Resources Conservation Service.\\r\\n\\r\\nStormwater runoff from industrial sources, municipal storm drains, and other sources were not specifically addressed in the 1972 law. The EPA declined to include urban runoff and industrial stormwater discharges in the NPDES program and so was sued by an environmental group. In 1977, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that stormwater discharges must be covered by the permit program.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nA growing body of water research during the late 1970s and 1980s indicated that stormwater runoff was a significant cause of water quality impairment in many parts of the US. In the early 1980s, the EPA conducted the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program (NURP) to document the extent of the urban stormwater problem. The agency began to develop regulations for stormwater permit coverage but encountered resistance from industry and municipalities, and there were additional rounds of litigation. The litigation was pending when Congress considered further amendments to the CWA in 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Water Quality Act of 1987, Congress responded to the stormwater problem by defining industrial stormwater dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems (often called \\"MS4\\") as point sources, and requiring them to obtain NPDES permits, by specific deadlines. The permit exemption for agricultural discharges continued, but Congress created several programs and grants, including a demonstration grant program at the EPA to expand the research and development of nonpoint controls and management practices.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress created a major public works financing program for municipal sewage treatment in the 1972 CWA. A ssystem of grants for construction of municipal sewage treatment plants was authorized and funded in Title II. In the initial program, the federal portion of each grant was up to 75 percent of a facility's capital cost, with the remainder financed by the state. In subsequent amendments Congress reduced the federal proportion of the grants and in the 1987 WQA transitioned to a revolving loan program in Title VI. Industrial and other private facilities are required to finance their own treatment improvements on the \\"polluter pays\\" principle.\\r\\n\\r\\nCongress passed the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) to provide an expanded credit program for water and wastewater infrastructure projects, with broader eligibility criteria than the previously-authorized revolving fund unter CWA Title VI.[22] Pursuant to WIFIA, EPA established its Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center in 2015 to help local governments and municipal utilities design innovative financing mechanisms, including publicÿprivate partnerships.[23] Congress amended the WIFIA program in 2015 and 2016.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Act has six titles.\\r\\n\\r\\nTitle I includes a Declaration of Goals and Policy[25] and various grant authorizations for research programs and pollution control programs.  Some of the programs authorized by the 1972 law are ongoing (e.g. section 104 research programs, section 106 pollution control programs, section 117 Chesapeake Bay Program) while other programs no longer receive funds from Congress and have been discontinued.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo assist municipalities in creating or expanding sewage treatment plants, also known as publicly owned treatment works (POTW), Title II established a system of construction grants. The 1972 CWA provided that federal funds would support 75% of project costs, with state and local funds providing the remaining 25%. In 1981 Congress reduced the federal funding proportion for most grants to 55%.[26]:4 [27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe construction grant program was replaced by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund in the 1987 WQA (see Title VI), although some local utilities continued to receive \\"special purpose project grants\\" directly from Congress, through a budgetary procedure known as \\"earmarking.\\"[26]:5\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 301 of the Act prohibits discharges to waters of the U.S. except with a permit.[28] Recreational vessels are exempt from the permit requirements, but vessel operators must implement Best Management Practices to control their discharges.[29] (See Title IV for discussion of permit programs.)\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder the 1972 act EPA began to issue technology-based standards for municipal and industrial sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the effluent guidelines and categorical pretreatment standards regulations have been published for 59 categories and apply to approximately 40,000 facilities that discharge directly to the nation's waters, 129,000 facilities that discharge to POTWs, and construction sites. These regulations are responsible for preventing the discharge of almost 700 billion pounds of pollutants each year.[33] EPA has updated some categories since their initial promulgation and has added new categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secondary treatment standards for POTWs and the effluent guidelines are implemented through NPDES permits. (See Title IV.)  The categorical pretreatment standards are typically implemented by POTWs through permits that they issue to their industrial users.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater quality standards (WQS) are risk-based requirements which set site-specific allowable pollutant levels for individual water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, streams and wetlands. States set WQS by designating uses for the water body (e.g., recreation, water supply, aquatic life, agriculture) and applying water quality criteria (numeric pollutant concentrations and narrative requirements) to protect the designated uses. An antidegradation policy is also issued by each state to maintain and protect existing uses and high quality waters.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a state fails to issue WQS, EPA is required to issue standards for that state.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nWater bodies that do not meet applicable water quality standards with technology-based controls alone are placed on the section 303(d) list of water bodies not meeting standards. Water bodies on the 303(d) list require development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). A TMDL is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet WQS.  The TMDL is determined after study of the specific properties of the water body and the pollutant sources that contribute to the non-compliant status. Generally, the TMDL determines load based on a Waste Load Allocation (WLA), Load Allocation (LA), and Margin of Safety (MOS)  Once the TMDL assessment is completed and the maximum pollutant loading capacity defined, an implementation plan is developed that outlines the measures needed to reduce pollutant loading to the non-compliant water body, and bring it into compliance. Over 60,000 TMDLs are proposed or in development for U.S. waters in the next decade and a half.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the issuance of a TMDL for a water body, implementation of the requirements involves modification to NPDES permits for facilities discharging to the water body to meet the WLA allocated to the water body (see Title IV).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of 2007, approximately half of the rivers, lakes, and bays under EPA oversight were not safe enough for fishing and swimming.[37] The development of WQS and TMDL is a complex process, both scientifically and legally, and it is a resource-intensive process for state agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary mode of informing the quality of water of rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, estuaries, coastal waters and wetlands of the U.S. is through the National Water Quality Inventory Report. Water quality assessments are conducted pursuant to water quality standards adopted by states and other jurisdictions (territories, interstate commissions and tribes). The report is conveyed to Congress as a means to inform Congress and the public of compliance with quality standards established by states, territories and tribes.[38][39] The assessments identify water quality problems within the states and jurisdictions, list the impaired and threatened water bodies, and identify non-point sources that contribute to poor water quality. Every two years states must submit reports that describe water quality conditions to EPA with a complete inquiry of social and economic costs and benefits of achieving goals of the Act. The report is organized into two major sections; Section 1 shows national assessment of each type of water body, with causes and sources identified. Section 2 summarizes recommendations on improvement of water resource management.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder section 309, EPA can issue administrative orders against violators, and seek civil or criminal penalties when necessary.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates that are authorized by EPA to administer the NPDES program must have authority to enforce permit requirements under their respective state laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary bases, national parks and other federal facilities must comply with CWA provisions.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 316 requires standards for thermal pollution discharges, as well as standards for cooling water intake structures (e.g., fish screens).[42] These standards are applicable to power plants and other industrial facilities.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1987 amendments created the Nonpoint Source Management Program under CWA section 319.[44] This program provides grants to states, territories and Indian tribes to support demonstration projects, technology transfer, education, training, technical assistance and related activities designed to reduce nonpoint source pollution. Grant funding for the program averaged $210 million annually for Fiscal Years 2004 through 2008.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates are required to certify that discharges authorized by federal permits will not violate the state's water quality standards.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NPDES permits program is authorized by CWA section 402.[47] The initial permits issued in the 1970s and early 1980s focused on POTWs and industrial wastewatertypically \\"process\\" wastewater and cooling water where applicable, and in some cases, industrial stormwater. The 1987 WQA expanded the program to cover stormwater discharges explicitly, both from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4) and industrial sources.[48] The MS4 NPDES permits require regulated municipalities to use Best Management Practices to reduce pollutants to the \\"Maximum Extent Practicable.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPOTWs with combined sewers are required to comply with the national Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy, published by EPA in 1994.[49] The policy requires municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate overflow-related pollution problems.[50] About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40 million people.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-stormwater permits typically include numeric effluent limitations for specific pollutants. A numeric limitation quantifies the maximum pollutant load or concentration allowed in the discharge, e.g., 30?mg/L of biochemical oxygen demand. Exceeding a numeric limitation constitutes a violation of the permit, and the discharger is subject to fines as laid out in section 309. Facilities must periodically monitor their effluent (i.e., collect and analyze wastewater samples), and submit Discharge Monitoring Reports to the appropriate agency, to demonstrate compliance. Stormwater permits typically require facilities to prepare a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan and implement best management practices, but do not specify numeric effluent limits and may not include regular monitoring requirements. Some permits cover both stormwater and non-stormwater discharges. NPDES permits must be reissued every five years. Permit agencies (EPA, states, tribes) must provide notice to the public of pending permits and provide an opportunity for public comment.[52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, EPA estimated that there are over 500,000 stormwater permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants, and construction sites, which are temporary stormwater dischargers.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter passage of the CWA in 1972, a controversy arose as to its application to agriculture and certain other activities.  The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of dredged materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern that the federal government was about to place all agricultural activities under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic over-regulation.[54]:901ÿ903 When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the governments supervisionin other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1977 amendments included a set of six section 404 exemptions.  For example, totally new activities such as construction of farm roads, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(E), construction of farm or stock ponds or irrigation ditches, and minor agricultural drainage, Sec. 1344(f)(1)(A), all are exempted by Statute.  Section 1344(f)(1)(C), which exempts discharge of dredged material for the purpose of. . . the maintenance of drainage ditches. All of these exemptions were envisioned to be self-executing, that is not technically requiring an administrative no-jurisdiction determination. One such example was the maintenance of agricultural drainage ditches.[54]:906 Throughout the hearing process, Congressmen of every environmental persuasion repeatedly stated that the over $5 Billion invested in drainage facilities could be maintained without government regulation of any kind.[54]:906ÿ912 Senator Edmund Muskie, for example, explained that exempt activities such as agricultural drainage would be entirely unregulated.[54]:949 Other exemptions were granted as well, including exemptions for normal farming activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Congress envisioned a set of self-executing exemptions, it has become common for landowners to seek no-jurisdiction determinations from the USACE.  A landowner who intends to make substantial investments in acquisition or improvement of land might lawfully proceed with exempt activity, a permit not being required.  The problem is that if the landowner's assumptions were incorrect and the activity later determined not to be exempt, the USACE will issue a cease and desist order.  Obtaining an advanced ruling provides some level of comfort that the activities will have been deemed conducted in good faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause some of the six exemptions involved new activities, such as minor drainage and silviculture (the clearing of forests by the timber industry), Congress recognized the need to impose some limitations on exemptions.  Consequently, Congress placed the so-called recapture clause limitation on these new project exemptions.  Under section 404(f)(2), such new projects would be deprived of their exemption if all of the following three characteristics could be shown:\\r\\n\\r\\nTo remove the exemption, all of these requirements must be fulfilledthe discharge, the project purpose of bringing an area into a use to which it was not previously subject, and the impairment or reduction of navigable waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder sections 301 and 502 of the Clean Water Act,[55] any discharge of dredged or fill materials into \\"waters of the United States,\\" including wetlands, is forbidden unless authorized by a permit issued by the USACE pursuant to section 404.[56] Essentially, all discharges of fill or dredged material affecting the bottom elevation of a jurisdictional water of the U.S. require a Department of the Army (DA) permit from USACE.  These permits are an essential part of protecting streams and wetlands, which are often filled by land developers. Wetlands are vital to the ecosystem in filtering streams and rivers and providing habitat for wildlife.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nMountaintop removal mining requires a section 404 permit when soil and rock from the mining operation is placed in streams and wetlands (commonly called a \\"valley fill\\"). Pollutant discharges from valley fills to streams also requires an NPDES permit.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two main types of wetlands permits: general permits and individual permits. General permits change periodically and cover broad categories of activities, and require the permittee to comply with all stated conditions. General permits (such as the Nationwide Permits) are issued for fill activities that will result in minimal adverse effects to the environment. Individual permits are utilized for actions that are not addressed by a general permit, or that do not meet the conditions of a General Permit. In addition, individual permits typically require more analysis than do the general permits, and usually require much more time to prepare the application and to process the permit.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the USACE processes an application for an Individual Permit, it must publish/issue a public notice describing the proposed action described in the permit application. Although the Corps District Engineer makes the decision to grant a permit, the USEPA Administrator may veto a permit if it is not reasonable. Before making such a decision, however, USEPA must consult with the USACE. A DA permit typically expires after five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1987 WQA created a program for management of biosolids (sludge) generated by POTWs.[59] The Act instructed EPA to develop guidelines for usage and disposal of sewage sludge or biosolids. The EPA regulations: (1) Identify uses for sewage sludge, including disposal; (2) Specify factors to be taken into account in determining the measures and practices applicable to each such use or disposal (including publication of information on costs); and (3) Identify concentrations of pollutants which interfere with each such use or disposal. EPA created an Intra-Agency Sludge Task Force to aid in developing comprehensive sludge regulations that are designed to do the following: (1) Conduct a multimedia examination of sewage sludge management, focusing on sewage sludge generated by POTWs; and (2) develop a cohesive Agency policy on sewage sludge management, designed to guide the Agency in implementing sewage sludge regulatory and management programs.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term biosolids is used to differentiate treated sewage sludge that can be beneficially recycled. Environmental advantages of sewage sludge consist of, application of sludge to land due to its soil condition properties and nutrient content. Advantages also extend to reduction in adverse health effects of incineration, decreased chemical fertilizer dependency, diminishing greenhouse gas emissions deriving from incineration and reduction in incineration fuel and energy costs. Beneficial reuse of sewage sludge is supported in EPA policies: the 1984 Beneficial Reuse Policy and the 1991 Inter-agency Policy on Beneficial Use of Sewage Sludge, with an objective to reduce volumes of waste generated. Sewage sludge contains nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus but also contains significant numbers of pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa and eggs of parasitic worms. Sludge also contains more than trace amounts of organic and inorganic chemicals. Benefits of reusing sewage sludge from use of organic and nutrient content in biosolids is valuable source in improving marginal lands and serving as supplements to fertilizers and soil conditioners. Extension of benefits of sludge on agriculture commodities include increase forest productivity, accelerated tree growth, re-vegetation of forest land previously devastated by natural disasters or construction activities. Also, sewage sludge use to aid growth of final vegetative cap for municipal solid waste landfills is enormously beneficial. Opposing benefits of sludge water result from high levels of pathogenic organisms that can possibly contaminate soil, water, crops, livestock, and fish. Pathogens, metals, organic chemical content and odors are cause of major health, environmental and aesthetic factors. Sludge treatment processes reduce the level of pathogens which becomes important when applying sludge to land as well as distributing and marketing it. Pollutants of sewage sludge come from domestic wastewater, discharge of industrial wastewater, municipal sewers and also from runoffs from parking lots, lawns and fields that were applied fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quality of sewage sludge is controlled under section 405(d), where limitations are set with methods of use or disposal for pollutants in sludge. EPA, under section 405(d)(3), established a containment approach to limit pollutants instead of numerical limitations. This methodology is more reasonable than numerical limitations and includes design standards, equipment standards, management practice, and operational standards or combination of these. Limits on sewage sludge quality allows treatment works that generate less contaminated pollutants and those that do not meet the sludge quality standards for use and disposal practice must clean up influent, improve sewage sludge treatment and/or select another use of disposal method. EPA has set standards for appropriate practices of use and disposal of biosolids in order to protect public health and the environment, but choice of use or disposal practices are reserved to local communities. Listed under section 405(e) of CWA, local communities are encouraged to use their sewage sludge for its beneficial properties instead of disposing it.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nStandards are set for sewage sludge generated or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs are referred to as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned wastewater treatment works. Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nAny U.S. citizen may file a citizen suit against any person who has allegedly violated an effluent limitation regulation or against the EPA Administrator if the EPA Administrator failed to perform any non-discretionary act or duty required by the CWA.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CWA includes an employee (\\"whistleblower\\") protection provision.  Employees in the U.S. who believe they were fired or suffered adverse action related to enforcement of the CWA may file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program was authorized by the 1987 WQA.[63] This replaced the municipal construction grants program, which was authorized in the 1972 law under Title II. In the CWSRF, federal funds are provided to the states and Puerto Rico to capitalize their respective revolving funds, which are used to provide financial assistance (loans or grants) to local governments for wastewater treatment, nonpoint source pollution control and estuary protection.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fund provides loans to municipalities at lower-than-market rates. The average interest rate was 1.4 percent nationwide in 2017, compared to an average market rate of 3.5 percent. In 2017, CWSRF assistance totaling $7.4 billion was provided to 1,484 local projects across the country.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1880s and 1890s, Congress directed USACE to prevent dumping and filling in the nation's harbors, and the program was vigorously enforced.[66] Congress first addressed water pollution issues in the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899,[67] giving the Corps the authority to regulate most kinds of obstructions to navigation, including hazards resulting from effluents. Portions of this law remain in effect, including Section 13, the so-called Refuse Act.  In 1910, USACE used the act to object to a proposed sewer in New York City, but a court ruled that pollution control was a matter left to the states alone. Speaking to the 1911 National Rivers and Harbors Congress, the chief of the Corps, Brigadier General William H. Bixby, suggested that modern treatment facilities and prohibitions on dumping \\"should either be made compulsory or at least encouraged everywhere in the United States.\\"[66]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome sections of the 1899 act have been superseded by various amendments, including the 1972 CWA, while other notable legislative predecessors include:\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen EPA first opened its doors in 1970, the agency had weak authority to protect U.S. waters, lacking the legal power to write effluent guidelines and possessing only general authority to require secondary treatment from industrial dischargers.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nExecutive Order 12898 (1994) states ... each Federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority, low-income, and indigenous populations.[74] The order is also intended to advocate nondiscrimination in federal programs that influence the environment and public health, and aims to provide low-income, minority, and indigenous communities access to public information and participation.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2015 EPA released a new rule on the definition of \\"waters of the United States\\" (\\"WOTUS\\") and the future enforcement of the act.[86][87] Thirteen states sued, and on August 27 U.S. Chief District Judge for North Dakota Ralph R. Erickson issued a preliminary injunction blocking the regulation in those states.[88] In a separate lawsuit, on October 9 a divided Sixth Circuit appeals court stayed the rules application nationwide.[89] Congress then passed a joint resolution under the Congressional Review Act overturning the WOTUS rule,[90] but President Barack Obama vetoed the measure.[91]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn February 28, 2017, President Donald Trump signed documents directing EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and rewrite the Obama administration's \\"Clean Water Rule,\\" which would clarify the WOTUS definition. The agencies were ordered to reassess the rule consistent with promoting economic growth and minimizing regulatory uncertainty.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sixth Circuit appeals court stay was overturned on January 22, 2018 when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that challenges to the 2015 rule must be filed in United States district courts.[93] EPA then formally suspended the 2015 regulation and announced plans to issue a new version later in 2018.[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo date, the water quality goals stated by Congress in the 1972 act have not been achieved by American society:\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than half of U.S. stream and river miles continue to violate water quality standards. Surveys of lakes, ponds and reservoirs indicated that about 70 percent were impaired (measured on a surface area basis), and a little more than 70 percent of the nations coastlines, and 90 percent of the surveyed ocean and near coastal areas were also impaired.[96] The reasons for the impairment vary by location; major sources are agriculture, industry and communities (typically through urban runoff). Some of these pollution sources are difficult to control through national regulatory programs.[97]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, since the passage of the 1972 act, the levels of pollution in the United States have experienced a dramatic decrease. The law has resulted in much cleaner waterways than before the bill was passed. Agriculture, industry, communities and other sources continue to discharge waste into surface waters nationwide, and many of these waters are drinking water sources. In many watersheds nutrient pollution (excess nitrogen and phosphorus) has become a major problem.[98] It is argued in a 2008 paper that the Clean Water Act has made extremely positive contributions to the environment, but is in desperate need of reform to address the pollution problems that remain.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2017 economic study finds that \\"most types of water pollution declined [over the period 1962-2001], though the rate of decrease slowed over time... Our finding of decreases in most pollutants implies that the prevalence of such violations was even greater before the Clean Water Act.\\" Several studies have estimated that the costs of the CWA (including the expenditures for the Title II construction grants program) are higher than the benefits. An EPA study had similar findings, but acknowledged that several kinds of benefits were unmeasured.[95]:2 (See Costÿbenefit analysis.)","input":"Who is responsible for enforcing water quality standards?"},{"output":"97.50%","context":"Water is distributed across earth. Most water in the Earth's atmosphere and crust comes from the world ocean's saline seawater, while freshwater accounts for only 2.5% of the total. Because the oceans that cover roughly 78% of the area of the Earth reflect blue light, the Earth appears blue from space, and is often referred to as the blue planet and the Pale Blue Dot. An estimated 1.5 to 11 times the amount of water in the oceans may be found hundreds of miles deep within the Earth's interior, although not in liquid form.\\r\\nThe oceanic crust is young, thin and dense, with none of the rocks within it dating from any older than the breakup of Pangaea. Because water is much denser than any gas, this means that water will flow into the \\"depressions\\" formed as a result of the high density of oceanic crust. (On a planet like Venus, with no water, the depressions appear to form a vast plain above which rise plateaux). Since the low density rocks of the continental crust contain large quantities of easily eroded salts of the alkali and alkaline earth metals, salt has, over billions of years, accumulated in the oceans as a result of evaporation returning the fresh water to land as rain and snow.\\r\\nAs a result, the vast bulk of the water on Earth is regarded as saline or salt water, with an average salinity of 35R (or 3.5%, roughly equivalent to 34 grams of salts in 1?kg of seawater), though this varies slightly according to the amount of runoff received from surrounding land. In all, water from oceans and marginal seas, saline groundwater and water from saline closed lakes amount to over 97% of the water on Earth, though no closed lake stores a globally significant amount of water. Saline groundwater is seldom considered except when evaluating water quality in arid regions.\\r\\nThe remainder of the Earth's water constitutes the planet's fresh water resource. Typically, fresh water is defined as water with a salinity of less than 1 percent that of the oceans - i.e. below around 0.35R. Water with a salinity between this level and 1R is typically referred to as marginal water because it is marginal for many uses by humans and animals. The ratio of salt water to fresh water on Earth is around 40 to 1.\\r\\nThe planet's fresh water is also very unevenly distributed. Although in warm periods such as the Mesozoic and Paleogene when there were no glaciers anywhere on the planet all fresh water was found in rivers and streams, today most fresh water exists in the form of ice, snow, groundwater and soil moisture, with only 0.3% in liquid form on the surface. Of the liquid surface fresh water, 87% is contained in lakes, 11% in swamps, and only 2% in rivers. Small quantities of water also exist in the atmosphere and in living beings. Of these sources, only river water is generally valuable.\\r\\nMost lakes are in very inhospitable regions such as the glacial lakes of Canada, Lake Baikal in Russia, Lake Kh?vsg?l in Mongolia, and the African Great Lakes. The North American Great Lakes, which contain 21% of the world's fresh water by volume,[2][3][4] are the exception. They are located in a hospitable region, which is heavily populated. The Great Lakes Basin is home to 33 million people.[5] The Canadian cities of Toronto, Hamilton, Ontario, St. Catharines, Niagara, Oshawa, Windsor, and Barrie, and the United States cities of Duluth, Milwaukee, Chicago, Gary, Detroit, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Rochester, are all located on shores of the Great Lakes.\\r\\nAlthough the total volume of groundwater is known to be much greater than that of river runoff, a large proportion of this groundwater is saline and should therefore be classified with the saline water above. There is also a lot of fossil groundwater in arid regions that has never been renewed for thousands of years; this must not be seen as renewable water.\\r\\nHowever, fresh groundwater is of great value, especially in arid countries such as India. Its distribution is broadly similar to that of surface river water, but it is easier to store in hot and dry climates because groundwater storages are much more shielded from evaporation than are dams. In countries such as Yemen, groundwater from erratic rainfall during the rainy season is the major source of irrigation water.\\r\\nBecause groundwater recharge is much more difficult to accurately measure than surface runoff, groundwater is not generally used in areas where even fairly limited levels of surface water are available. Even today, estimates of total groundwater recharge vary greatly for the same region depending on what source is used, and cases where fossil groundwater is exploited beyond the recharge rate (including the Ogallala Aquifer[6]) are very frequent and almost always not seriously considered when they were first developed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total volume of water on Earth is estimated at 1.386 billion km3 (333 million cubic miles), with 97.5% being salt water and 2.5% being fresh water. Of the fresh water, only 0.3% is in liquid form on the surface.[7][8][9] In addition, the lower mantle of inner earth may hold as much as 5 times more water than all surface water combined (all oceans, all lakes, all rivers).[10]\\r\\nThe total volume of water in rivers is estimated at 2,120?km3 (510 cubic miles), or 2% of the surface fresh water on Earth.[7] Rivers and basins are often compared not according to their static volume, but to their flow of water, or surface runoff. The distribution of river runoff across the Earth's surface is very uneven.\\r\\nThere can be huge variations within these regions. For example, as much as a quarter of Australia's limited renewable fresh water supply is found in almost uninhabited Cape York Peninsula.[11] Also, even in well-watered continents, there are areas that are extremely short of water, such as Texas in North America, whose renewable water supply totals only 26?km3/year in an area of 695,622?km2, or South Africa, with only 44?km3/year in 1,221,037?km2.[11] The areas of greatest concentration of renewable water are:\\r\\nVariability of water availability is important both for the functioning of aquatic species and also for the availability of water for human use: water that is only available in a few wet years must not be considered renewable. Because most global runoff comes from areas of very low climatic variability, the total global runoff is generally of low variability.\\r\\nIndeed, even in most arid zones, there tends to be few problems with variability of runoff because most usable sources of water come from high mountain regions which provide highly reliable glacier melt as the chief source of water, which also comes in the summer peak period of high demand for water. This historically aided the development of many of the great civilizations of ancient history, and even today allows for agriculture in such productive areas as the San Joaquin Valley.\\r\\nHowever, in Australia and Southern Africa, the story is different. Here, runoff variability is much higher than in other continental regions of the world with similar climates.[12] Typically temperate (K?ppen climate classification C) and arid (K?ppen climate classification B) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa have as much as three times the coefficient of variation of runoff of those in other continental regions.[13] The reason for this is that, whereas all other continents have had their soils largely shaped by Quaternary glaciation and mountain building, soils of Australia and Southern Africa have been largely unaltered since at least the early Cretaceous and generally since the previous ice age in the Carboniferous. Consequently, available nutrient levels in Australian and Southern African soils tend to be orders of magnitude lower than those of similar climates in other continents, and native flora compensate for this through much higher rooting densities (e.g. proteoid roots) to absorb minimal phosphorus and other nutrients. Because these roots absorb so much water, runoff in typical Australian and Southern African rivers does not occur until about 300?mm (12?inches) or more of rainfall has occurred. In other continents, runoff will occur after quite light rainfall due to the low rooting densities.\\r\\nThe consequence of this is that many rivers in Australia and Southern Africa (as compared to extremely few in other continents) are theoretically impossible to regulate because rates of evaporation from dams mean a storage sufficiently large to theoretically regulate the river to a given level would actually allow very little draft to be used. Examples of such rivers include those in the Lake Eyre Basin. Even for other Australian rivers, a storage three times as large is needed to provide a third the supply of a comparable climate in southeastern North America or southern China. It also affects aquatic life, favouring strongly those species able to reproduce rapidly after high floods so that some will survive the next drought.\\r\\nTropical (K?ppen climate classification A) climate rivers in Australia and Southern Africa do not, in contrast, have markedly lower runoff ratios than those of similar climates in other regions of the world. Although soils in tropical Australia and southern Africa are even poorer than those of the arid and temperate parts of these continents, vegetation can use organic phosphorus or phosphate dissolved in rainwater as a source of the nutrient. In cooler and drier climates these two related sources tend to be virtually useless, which is why such specialised means are needed to extract the most minimal phosphorus.\\r\\nThere are other isolated areas of high runoff variability, though these are basically due to erratic rainfall rather than different hydrology. These include:[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is estimated an additional 1.5 to eleven times the amount of water in the oceans is contained in the Earth's interior,[15] and some scientists have hypothesized that the water in the mantle is part of a \\"whole-Earth water cycle\\".[16] The water in the mantle is dissolved in various minerals near the transition zone between Earth's upper and lower mantle. At temperatures of 1,100?C (2,010?F) and extreme pressures found deep underground, water breaks down into hydroxyls and oxygen.[17] The existence of water was experimentally predicted in 2002,[18] and direct evidence of the water was found in 2014 based on tests on a sample of ringwoodite.[19] Further evidence for large quantities of water in the mantle was found in observations of melting in the transition zone from the USArray project.[20] Liquid water is not present within the ringwoodite, rather the components of water (hydrogen and oxygen) are held within as hydroxide ions.[19]","input":"What is the percentage of salt water in the world?"},{"output":"Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Robins","context":"Extra innings is the extension of a baseball or softball game in order to break a tie.\\r\\nOrdinarily, a baseball game consists of nine innings (in softball and high school baseball games there are typically seven innings; in Little League, six), each of which is divided into halves: the visiting team bats first, after which the home team takes its turn at bat. However, if the score remains tied at the end of the regulation number of complete innings, the rules provide that \\"play shall continue until (1) the visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end of a completed inning; or (2) the home team scores the winning run in an uncompleted inning.\\"\\r\\nThe rules of the game, including the batting order, availability of substitute players and pitchers, etc., remain intact in extra innings. Managers must display caution to avoid using all their substitute players, in case the game reaches extensive extra innings. The rules call for a forfeiture if a team is unable to field a full team of nine players.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Major League Baseball, home teams won about 52% of extra-inning games from 1957 to 2007.[1] During this same time period, home teams have won about 54% of all baseball games.[2] So while the home team has some advantage in extra-inning games, this advantage is less noticeable than the initial home-field advantage. Home teams tend to have the greatest advantage in run-scoring during the first 3 innings.[2]\\r\\nFor the visiting team to win, it must score as many runs as possible in the first (or \\"top\\") half of the inning and then prevent the home team from tying or taking the lead in the second (or \\"bottom\\") half. Because it bats in the bottom half of an inning, a home team wins the game by taking the lead at any point in the final inning. Normally in such a situation, the moment the winning run scores for whatever reason (base hit, sacrifice, wild pitch), the game immediately ends and no other runs are allowed. The term for winning in this scenario is a \\"walk-off\\" win (as everyone can walk off the field as soon as the winning run is scored). The exception is if the winning hit is a walk-off home run; all runners on base and the batter must circle the bases on a home run, so all their runs count for the final score.[3] Each extra inning simply repeats this scenario.\\r\\nThe East Asian professional leagues, NPB, KBO, and CPBL have a 12-inning limit before the game is declared a draw.\\r\\nAdditionally, NPB games have a total time limit of three and a half hours during the regular season before being counted as a tie.[4] In postseason play, the limit for number of innings is extended to 15, and the last game is completely replayed if drawn, leading to seven-game series that can go on for eight games. There are no limits on the number of innings in the eighth game of the Japan Series.\\r\\nThe KBO does not play extra innings in the first game of a double-header. Tie games are discarded when calculating winning percentages since 2002, except for 2008 when it was counted as a loss in the league's standings. Before 2002, they counted as half a win.\\r\\nIn the 11th inning, the manager selects anywhere in the batting order to start the inning, regardless of the last player put out. The batter immediately preceding this newly designated leadoff man becomes a runner on first base, and the next preceding batter is placed on second base. In subsequent innings, the batting order continues as normal, but the two players preceding the player scheduled to lead off the inning start on second and first.\\r\\nThis has also been adopted by European leagues Division de Honor (Spain), Italian Baseball League, and Honkbal Hoofdklasse (Netherlands).\\r\\nSince 2009, a modified form of the rule has been used for the World Baseball Classic. Unlike the standard rule, the batting order may not start from a different place. Through the 2013 edition, the first inning in which teams started with runners on first and second was the 13th. The rule was not used in either the 2009 or 2013 editions because no game lasted more than 11 innings. For the 2017 World Baseball Classic, the rule was modified to use extra runners for the first time in the 11th inning, and it would see its first use in a second-round game between Japan and the Netherlands at the Tokyo Dome. Japan won that game thanks to a sacrifice bunt and a 2-run hit.\\r\\nOther methods include the following:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn international softball, a special extra innings rule starts immediately after regulation. Each team begins their half of the inning with a runner on second base (the last player to be put out). This increases the odds that teams will score and ensures a faster resolution. There is a drawback, though, in that the home team has a big advantage in going second. Should the visiting team fail to score, all the home team must do to win is, for example, get a successful bunt and sacrifice fly to score the winning run. This rule is also used in certain NCAA college conferences, usually applied after one or two extra innings where the \\"international tiebreaker\\" is not used.\\r\\nDuring spring training in Major League Baseball, whenever a game remains tied after ten innings, it is declared to end in a tie. This is done because teams often travel on a daily basis, and also to reduce chances for injuries because the games do not officially count in the standings.\\r\\nThere are nine innings in a professional baseball game.\\r\\nThe record for the most innings ever played in a single professional game is 33 which occurred in a 1981 minor-league game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and the Rochester Red Wings, Triple-A affiliates of the Boston Red Sox and the Baltimore Orioles, respectively. Interestingly, each team had a future Hall of Famer on its roster: Wade Boggs for Pawtucket and Cal Ripken Jr. for Rochester.\\r\\nThe longest game by innings in Major League Baseball was a 1ÿ1 tie in the National League between the Boston Braves and the Brooklyn Robins in 26 innings, at Braves Field in Boston on May 1, 1920. It had become too dark to see the ball (fields did not have lights yet and the sun was setting), and the game was considered a draw. Played rapidly by modern standards, those 26 innings were completed in 3 hours and 50 minutes. As was the custom, the first pitch was thrown at 3:00?p.m.; home plate umpire Barry McCormick called the game as lights began appearing in the windows of buildings across the Charles River, just before 7:00?p.m.\\r\\nThe longest American League game, and tied for the longest major league game by innings which ended with one team winning, was a 7ÿ6 victory by the Chicago White Sox over the Milwaukee Brewers in 25 innings, at Comiskey Park in Chicago in 1984. The game began at 7:30?p.m. on May 8, 1984, and after scoring early runs both teams scored twice in the 8th inning; but the game was suspended after 17 innings with the score tied 3ÿ3 due to a league curfew rule prohibiting an inning from beginning after 12:59?a.m. The game was continued the following evening, May 9, 1984, and both teams scored three times in the 21st inning to make the score 6ÿ6; finally, in the bottom of the 25th, the White Sox' Harold Baines hit a home run to end the contest. Tom Seaver was the winning pitcher in relief.[5] A regularly scheduled game followed, meaning both nights saw 17 innings played; Seaver also started, and won, the second game. The official time of the entire 25-inning game was 8 hours, 6 minutes, also a major league record.[6]\\r\\nOn September 11, 1974, the St. Louis Cardinals won a marathon night game against the New York Mets, after 7 hours 4 minutes, and 25 innings, also tied for the longest game to a decision in major league history. Two Mets' errors led to the Cardinals' winning run, starting with an errant pickoff throw that allowed Bake McBride to scamper all the way around from first. St. Louis won, 4ÿ3.[7] The Mets went to the plate 103 times, a record in a major league game; the Cards were not far behind with 99 plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats were recorded, with a major-league record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans were still at Shea Stadium when the game ended at 3:13?a.m. ET. (Unlike the American League, the National League did not have a curfew.) This was the longest game played to a decision without a suspension.[8][9]\\r\\nOn April 15, 1968, the Houston Astros defeated the Mets 1-0 in a 24-inning game at the Houston Astrodome. The 6-hour, 6-minute contest, which ended with the Astros' Bob Aspromonte hitting a grounder through the legs of Mets shortstop Al Weis in the bottom of the 24th, remains the longest shutout game in Major League history. It also had the most scoreless innings (23) in a major-league game.[10]\\r\\nThe longest American League game to end in a tie was a 24-inning contest between the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Athletics on July 21, 1945. The teams were tied 1ÿ1 when the game was called due to darkness at Shibe Park; the Tigers' Les Mueller had pitched a record 19?2?3 innings (and only given up one run) before being taken out in the 20th inning.\\r\\nThe longest game to end in a scoreless tie was a National League contest between the Cincinnati Reds and Brooklyn Dodgers on September 11, 1946. The teams went 19 innings before darkness fell at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field, forcing the game to be called on account of darkness. In the American League, the longest 0ÿ0 game was played between the Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers on July 16, 1909. The game was called after 18 innings due to darkness at Bennett Park in Detroit. The longest scoreless period within a completed game came in the April 15, 1968 game between the Astros and Mets which remained scoreless after 23 innings.\\r\\nThe Washington Senators became the first team in Major League history to play multiple games of at least 20 innings in a season when they defeated the Minnesota Twins 9ÿ7 on August 9, 1967, in 20 innings, having set a franchise record for innings played with a 22-inning win over the Chicago White Sox on June 12 of that year. This feat would later be accomplished by the 1971 Oakland Athletics who had games of 21 and 20 innings and the 1989 Los Angeles Dodgers who played two 22-inning games, against the Houston Astros in June and the Montreal Expos in August.[11]\\r\\nThe longest doubleheader in Major League history came on May 31, 1964. The San Francisco Giants beat the New York Mets 5ÿ3 in nine innings in the day's first game at Shea Stadium, and then won the nightcap 8ÿ6 after 23 innings (despite a rare triple play turned by the Mets in the 14th). The two games lasted a combined nine hours, 52 minutes. The Mets' Ed Kranepool played in all 32 innings of the two games; Kranepool had been called up to the team that day after having played in both games of a doubleheader the day before for their Triple-A farm club in Buffalo.\\r\\nOn April 5, 2012, the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Cleveland Indians 7ÿ4 in 16 innings. The five-hour, 14-minute game was the longest Opening Day game in Major League history.[12]\\r\\nOn June 8, 2013, the Toronto Blue Jays beat the Texas Rangers 4ÿ3 in 18 innings while the Miami Marlins beat the New York Mets 2ÿ1 in 20 innings. This was the second time in Major League history that two games of 18 innings or more were played on same day;[13] the first was August 15, 2006.[14]\\r\\nOn September 21, 2013, just past 2:00?a.m. ET, the Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Baltimore Orioles 5ÿ4 in 18 innings in a game that had started at 7:10?p.m. the night before.[15] Both teams were in contention for an American League wild card slot, with Boston having won the AL East division while this game was being played.\\r\\nOn September 24, 2013, the Arizona Diamondbacks set a major league record by playing their 77th extra inning of the season when their game against the San Diego Padres at Petco Park went into the 11th inning.[16] This broke the record of 76 extra innings played by the Minnesota Twins in 1969.\\r\\nOn August 10, 2014, at 12:39 AM, the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated the Boston Red Sox 5ÿ4 in 19 innings in a game that had started at 6 PM the night before.[17] Albert Pujols' walk off homer was quickly reviewed, per Boston's request, but the call was confirmed. That same day the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Detroit Tigers 6ÿ5 in a 19 inning game of their own, Both teams used all their available bench reserves as well as their entire available bullpen, Toronto even used starting pitcher Marcus Stroman as a pinch runner at one point. Tigers starter Rick Porcello would be credited with the loss after coming into the game in the 18th inning. Toronto reliever Chad Jenkins would get the win after pitching 6 innings of relief (an unusually long outing for a reliever) With Jos Bautista hitting a walk-off single to score Munenori Kawasaki to win the game. Toronto starter R.A. Dickey had begun warming up in the bullpen in the top of the 19th and likely would have come on in relief had the game gone to 20 innings. The game was the then longest in franchise history for Toronto. It is now tied with another 19 inning game, a 2ÿ1 loss to the Cleveland Indians on July 1, 2016.\\r\\nOn April 11, 2015, the Boston Red Sox defeated their historic AL East division rivals the New York Yankees 6ÿ5 in 19 innings at Yankee Stadium. The game began at 7:05 PM on April 10, and ended at 2:13 AM, after 6 hours and 49 minutes of play. The game also included a 16-minute delay due to a brief power outage. It was the longest game between the two teams since the 20-inning, 4-3 Yankees win on August 29, 1967. The length of the game in fact prompted a Twitter joke during the game by Yankees' media personality Mark Feinsand at 12:10 AM on the 11th regarding Mark Teixeira's birthday: Mark Teixeira was 34 when this game began. He's now 35. #TrueStory.[18]\\r\\nOn May 28, 2017, the Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Minnesota Twins 8ÿ6, in a 15-inning, 6-hour-and-26-minute game. Both teams combined had 115 at-bats, 33 hits and 21 strikeouts. This would be the second longest game in Tampa Bay Rays history.\\r\\nThe longest major league postseason game was the second game of the 2014 National League Division Series, with the visiting San Francisco Giants winning 2ÿ1 in 18 innings over the Washington Nationals. The game ended just after midnight on October 5, 2014 and lasted 6 hours 23 minutes. The Nationals had been leading 1ÿ0 with two out in the ninth inning, with starter Jordan Zimmermann one out away from a complete-game shutout, but following a decision by manager Matt Williams to remove Zimmermann with two out after the latter walked Joe Panik, Washington closer Drew Storen gave up a single to Giants catcher Buster Posey and an RBI double to Pablo Sandoval, scoring Panik to tie the game 1ÿ1. Posey was thrown out at the plate trying to score the second San Francisco run on Sandoval's double. Bruce Bochy challenged the call but the call stood and it ended the top of the ninth. After Sergio Romo retired the Nationals in order in the bottom half, the game went into extra innings. There was no further scoring until Giants first baseman Brandon Belt led off the top of the 18th inning with a home run. Hunter Strickland, a September call-up, recorded the save.\\r\\nAnother 18-inning contest was played between the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros on October 9, 2005. In the 4th game of a National League Division Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, the Braves (who were trailing the series two games to one and facing elimination) took a 6ÿ1 lead into the 8th inning. A grand slam by Lance Berkman in the bottom of the 8th brought the score to 6ÿ5, and with two outs in the bottom of the 9th, Brad Ausmus homered to tie the game and send it to extra innings. The score remained deadlocked at 6ÿ6 until the 18th, when the Astros' Chris Burke (who entered the game in the 9th inning as a pinch runner) homered to left field to win the game and send Houston to the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Roger Clemens, who was brought in to pinch-hit in the 15th and pitched the last three innings in relief, was credited as the winning pitcher in the 5-hour, 50-minute contest. In a somewhat odd coincidence, Adam LaRoche and Tim Hudson played in both 18 inning games. This one as Atlanta Braves and the other one as opposing sides of one another with Hudson pitching in both games as the visiting team's starting pitcher. It is the longest winner in a potential clinching game in baseball history.\\r\\nExactly two weeks later on October 23, 2005, the same Houston Astros team lost to the Chicago White Sox in the longest World Series game by time, Game 3 of the 2005 Series, played at Minute Maid Park, which lasted 5 hours 41 minutes, breaking the previous record of 4 hours 51 minutes in Game 1 of the 2000 World Series. It also shared the record for the longest World Series game by innings at 14, tied with Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, played on October 9, 1916 between the Brooklyn Robins and Boston Red Sox at Braves Field, and Game 1 of the 2015 World Series, played on October 27, 2015 between the New York Mets and Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium.\\r\\nThe 1991 World Series was the longest best-of-seven[19] World Series ever in terms of total number of innings, running out to seven games, three of which were extra-innings contests (the longest of which ran out to 12 innings), a total of 69 innings before the trophy was finally claimed by the Minnesota Twins.\\r\\nThe 1986 National League Championship Series, which also involved the Astros, was notable for its two climactic extra-inning games. After the Astros and the New York Mets split the first four games of the series, the Mets won Game 5 in 12 innings and Game 6 in 16 innings to claim the pennant.\\r\\nThe 1986 American League Championship Series between the Boston Red Sox and the then named California Angels featured a dramatic game where The Angels were leading 3 games to 1 and leading 5ÿ4 in game 5, one strike away from the first ever pennant in franchise history, only for Red Sox's Dave Henderson hit a two-run homer off Angel closer Donnie Moore in the top of the ninth inning to give the Red Sox the lead. The Angels tied it in the bottom half but in the top of the 11th, Henderson's sac fly off Moore proved to be the winning margin and the Angels lost the game. The series returned to Boston and the Angels were outscored a combined 18ÿ5 in games 6 and 7 to lose the pennant.\\r\\nThe 1986 World Series between the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox went into extra innings in Game 6 as well. The Red Sox scored 2 runs in the top of the 10th inning to take a 5-3 lead and then got two quick outs with no one on base in the bottom of the 10th. With the Red Sox one out away from their first world championship in 86 years, reliever Calvin Schiraldi gives up three straight singles to cut the lead to one run with runners on first and third. Red Sox manager John McNamara replaces Schiraldi with Bob Stanley, who then throws a two-strike wild pitch to Mooke Wilson to allow the tying run to score and move the other runner to second base. The wild pitch was particularly notable in that it completely turned the tables on the Red Sox from what they had done while facing the Angels weeks earlier, as they themselves had now blown a situation in which they were one strike away from winning the series. Wilson subsequently hits a ground ball to first base that rolls through the legs of first baseman Bill Buckner to allow the winning run to score from second base, sending the World Series to a Game 7. Had Buckner not committed this error, the game would have either remained tied with runners on first and third for the next batter (if Wilson was safe) or would have gone to an 11th inning (if Wilson had been out).\\r\\nThe 1980 National League Championship Series, played between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies, had four of its five games go to extra innings. The Astros won the second and third games in 10 and 11 innings respectively, while the Phillies took Games 4 and 5 in 10 innings each.\\r\\nThe 2012 American League Division Series between the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Yankees had back-to-back extra inning games, going 12 and 13 innings respectively. The Yankees won Game 3 on a walk-off home run by Ra~l Iba?ez and the Orioles returned the favor the next night by winning Game 4.\\r\\nIn the 1995 American League Division Series, the Seattle Mariners and Yankees battled in Game 2 in 15 innings. The Yankees won the game on a two-run walk-off home run by Jim Leyritz, setting the record for longest game in MLB postseason history by time until 2005. In Game 5, the Mariners won the game and the series in 11 innings on Edgar Martnez's famous double that scored Ken Griffey Jr. Until 2011, this was the only LDS game 5 in either league to go into extra innings.\\r\\nThe 2014 American League Wild Card Game featured the first extra inning game in just its third year of postseason existence, was won by the Kansas City Royals over the Oakland Athletics in 12 innings.\\r\\nThe longest \\"winner take all\\" game (defined as the final game of a postseason series, in which the winning team clinches the title or advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated from the postseason) in MLB postseason history is Game 7 of the 1924 World Series, won by the Washington Senators over the New York Giants in 12 innings.\\r\\nThe longest major league All-Star Game by time was played on July 15, 2008 at Yankee Stadium, with the American League winning 4ÿ3 in 15 innings after four hours, 50 minutes.[20] This was the first time in All-Star game history that the AL won an All-Star game in extra innings. The previous nine times The National League went 8ÿ0ÿ1 in extra inning games.\\r\\nThe All-Star Game of July 11, 1967 at Anaheim Stadium also lasted 15 innings, but was considerably shorter in terms of elapsed time. The All-Star Game of July 9, 2002 at Miller Park was controversially declared a 7ÿ7 tie after 11 innings, when both teams ran out of available pitchers.[21]\\r\\nOn November 6, 2010, the record for longest Japan Series game was set in Game 6. The Chiba Lotte Marines and the Chunichi Dragons played 15 innings totaling 5 hours and 43 minutes. The game ended a 2-2 tie leading to a Game 7 in which the Marines won the game and the championship.\\r\\nThe longest college baseball game was played between Texas and Boston College on May 30, 2009, in a regional NCAA Division I Baseball Championship tournament game at Austin, Texas. Texas won the game, 3-2, in 25 innings as the visiting team under NCAA tournament rules on home-team declaration during a tournament. The game lasted seven hours three minutes.[22][23]","input":"What is the longest major league baseball game in history?"},{"output":"July 25, 1996","context":"This is a list of current and former Major League Baseball mascots, sorted alphabetically.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tradition in the Major League Baseball mascot began with Mr. Met, introduced for the New York Mets when Shea Stadium opened in 1964.  Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity of mascots increased when The San Diego Chicken started independently making appearances at San Diego Padres games in 1977.  Philadelphia Phillies management felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the Phillie Phanatic in 1978.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, all but three major-league teams have \\"official\\" mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels).  Five team mascots  Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals), the San Diego Chicken, the Phillie Phanatic, Mr. Met, and Slider (Cleveland Indians)  have been inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.  Several others have been nominated since the Hall's creation in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nAce is the official mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays. He, along with his female counterpart, \\"Diamond\\" replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo.  Like his predecessor, Ace resembles a large blue jay.  The mascot's name is baseball slang for a team's top starting pitcher (the \\"ace\\" of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season.  In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below).\\r\\n\\r\\nBarrelman (aka \\"Owgust\\" and \\"Beer Barrel Man\\"), is an auxiliary mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. He was resurrected and upgraded to be a costumed performing character in 2015, having previously only been an official logo image and since 1977 only appearing on special materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nBaxter the Bobcat is the mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks.[1]  His full name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000.  The mascot was created by Brantley Bell (who is currently an infielder in the Cincinnati Reds minor league system), the son of Jay Bell, one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. \\"D. Baxter\\" comes from the team's nickname, \\"the D-Backs\\".  The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play. Today called Chase Field, it was once called Bank One Ballpark, or \\"BOB\\" for short. The bobcat is a wild cat native to Arizona.\\r\\n\\r\\nBernie Brewer is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache.  A beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering.  Following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration.  He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths.\\r\\n\\r\\nBernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return.  Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers.  The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of the Lakefront Brewery, Inc. tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBilly The Marlin is the official mascot of the Miami Marlins. Resembling a marlin with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is a computer-animated video shown on the screen, during each game.  The name, picked by original team owner Wayne Huizenga, is derived from the fact that a marlin is a billfish, and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily.  On Mothers Day and Father's Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin.  Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into Hard Rock Stadium (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air.  While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy's parachute entrance.  When he didn't arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN's Dan Patrick's nightly quote, \\"Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993ÿ2002) entertaining Marlins fans.[2] Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983ÿ1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlooper is the new mascot of the Atlanta Braves.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn January 13, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that Clark, a \\"young, friendly Cub\\", would become the team's first official mascot in modern history. Clark was named after Clark Street, since the Cubs home field, Wrigley Field, is famously located at \\"Clark and Addison\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe D-backs Luchador is the second mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a giveaway of masks in June 2012 proved popular, the team introduced the Luchador as a permanent character in July 2013. He wears a black cape, red pants, and a mask patterned after the team's logo. Meant to represent the team's Hispanic fans, the Luchador also wrestles with Club Deportivo Coloseo at the Glendale Park and Swap.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDinger is the official mascot of the Colorado Rockies. He is an anthropomorphic purple triceratops. The choice of a dinosaur, specifically this type, was inspired by the discovery of a number of dinosaur fossilsmost notably a 7-foot-long (2.1?m), 1,000-pound (450?kg) triceratops skullat Coors Field during its construction. His name \\"Dinger\\" is one of many slang terms for a home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinger is often seen on the field before and after the game and roaming around the stadium during the game.  When Rockies hitters are at bat in the late innings of a game, he often dances in the seats immediately behind home plate in an effort to distract opposing pitchers, sitting down only immediately before the beginning motion of each pitch.[6][7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nDinger has been the Colorado Rockies biggest fan since he first hatched from his egg at Mile High Stadium on April 16, 1994 [1]. Dinger works year-round promoting physical fitness and literacy for thousands of elementary school students in the Rocky Mountain Region. He acts out his own Dinger Story for the kids. He also makes appearances at Children's Hospital Colorado and Denver Health. He makes appearances at Rockies events including the 5K Home Run, and the Rockies Rookies Kids Fan Club.[2]\\r\\nHe is a purple dinosaur with a Rockies jersey on with black sneakers.\\r\\n\\r\\nDJ Kitty is the new mascot for the Tampa Bay Rays. DJ Kitty comes from the Internet sensation of a kitty playing a DJ System and dancing to the music. The cat wears a Tampa Bay Rays ring, wears chains, and wears his Rays hat backwards. As of 2013, DJ Kitty is the new secondary mascot for the Rays along with Raymond.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredbird is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals.[9] He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team's uniform.  A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from \\"Redbird\\", a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nFredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of \\"beaking\\" the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by \\"Team Fredbird\\", a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties. He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area.\\r\\n\\r\\nGapper is one of the current mascots for the Cincinnati Reds.[10] He was first introduced as the furry companion to Mr. Red, the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, Great American Ball Park. The mascot was created by David Raymond's Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993.  A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the \\"gap\\" in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium.  The term \\"gapper\\" is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the \\"gap\\" between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence).  According to a recent cincinnati.com poll of the Red's four mascots, he is the least popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunior is the younger brother of Ace. He made his mascot debut in 2011. He is half the size of Ace so he wears the number 1/2. He only appears on Jr.Jays Saturdays. In the game, he and Ace stand in two different aisles and they run in slow motion and hug.\\r\\n\\r\\nLou Seal is the official mascot of the San Francisco Giants. \\"Born\\" on July 25, 1996,  Luigi Francisco Seal[11] has been a regular part of all Giants home games, as well as numerous events in San Francisco and around the United States, ever since. Although his name (a play on the name \\"Lucille\\") is a bit ambiguous, he is indeed \\"officially\\" male and the person inside the costume is a man.[12] Species-wise, Lou Seal is a reference to the San Francisco Seals, the baseball club that was a mainstay of the Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a contest held by the Giants where fans were asked for ideas, six people submitted the name \\"Lou Seal.\\" These lucky fans were then invited to a game that season where they sat in a luxury box and got to meet the newly named mascot, and one of them was randomly chosen to throw out the first pitch. In 2008 Forbes Magazine named Lou Seal the best mascot in sports.[citation needed] He has had 1,150 consecutive home-game appearances,[13] and is one of the four subjects followed in the second season of the Hulu series Behind the Mask.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nLou Seal also made occasional appearances at the Giants' High-A minor league team, the San Jose Giants. This practice ended in 2006 when the San Jose Giants introduced their own mascot named Gigante.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mariner Moose is the mascot of the Seattle Mariners. In 1990, a contest for children 14 and under was held to select a mascot, after 2500 entries the club chose the \\"Mariner Moose\\" The Moose made his debut on April 13, 1990 dancing on the field at the Kingdome.\\r\\nDuring the 1995 American League Division Series between the M's and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to Safeco Field and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around Safeco Field's warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007.  He also nearly ran over Coco Crisp with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Met is the official mascot of the New York Mets, and MLB's first live action mascot (April 14, 1964). He is a baseball-headed humanoid being who wears a Mets cap and uniform. He can be seen at Citi Field (and previously at Shea Stadium) during Mets home games. He also has appeared in several commercials as part of ESPN's This is SportsCenter campaign, and was selected in 2007 into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Starting in 2014, Mr. Met appeared as a sleeve patch on the Mets' blue alternate home and road jerseys.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Jan Met (or Lady Met) is the female version of Mr. Met, the mascot of the New York Mets. She is a baseball-headed humanoid being, has brown hair in a ponytail and wears a Mets cap and uniform.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Met first appeared at games in 1975 before disappearing into obscurity. She appeared with Mr. Met in a 2003 \\"This is SportsCenter\\" commercial. The Mets reintroduced Mrs. Met in mascot form in 2013.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Red (or The Running Man) was the first mascot of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He is a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Red made his first appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured Mr. Red's head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated entirely. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform and \\"Mr. Red\\" was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt.\\r\\nA human version of the mascot didn't appear until the early 1980s. The costumed mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs to take his place.  A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie Red.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Redlegs is a mascot of the Cincinnati Reds.  He was reintroduced in 2007 to play a supporting role, along with Mr. Red. Mr. Redlegs appeared as a patch on the Reds' uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the second red scare).  In 2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an ATV during pre-game antics.  This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a neck brace as a joke.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrbit is the mascot of the Houston Astros.  Orbit represents a green space alien with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston.  Originally serving as team mascot from 1990 until 1999, he was replaced by a new mascot, Junction Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo coincide with the Astros' move to the American League West and unveiling of their new uniforms, caps, and logo, Orbit was reintroduced on November 2, 2012 to serve as the Astros' mascot once more for 2013 and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Oriole Bird is the official mascot of the Baltimore Orioles and is a cartoon version of the bird of the same name. He was \\"hatched\\" out of a giant egg prior to the team's 1979 season opener at Memorial Stadium on April 6. According to Orioles.com, The Oriole Bird's favorite foods are \\"mostly bird seed, with occasional crab cake.\\" The Oriole Bird's head was featured on the team's caps from 1966 until 1988, and again since 2012.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaws is the mascot of the Detroit Tigers. He is a tiger who made his debut on May 5, 1995, in Tiger Stadium. He wears a Tigers hat and jersey; in previous years, Paws' jersey would have the current season's 2 digit abbreviation (i.e. '10 for 2010). However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws' number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired #11 and #16 in honor of Sparky Anderson and Hal Newhouser, respectively. His dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a Santa Claus outfit during \\"Christmas in July\\" night, or an Elvis Presley-inspired costume for Elvis Night. He \\"resides\\" in Comerica Park to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhillie Phanatic is the official mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to The San Diego Chicken. The character is named for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to current owner and former team vice president, Bill Giles, was to bring more families to  Veterans Stadium, the Phillies' ballpark at the time, which had become noted for rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an ATV at home games.  In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the 2nd best mascot in sports, behind San Francisco's Lou Seal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pierogis are a series of six people dressed in pierogi costumes that race in a promotion between innings during Pittsburgh Pirates baseball games. The contestants in this race include:Jalape?o Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange) and Potato Pete (blue). It was inspired by the Milwaukee Brewers' Sausage Race. Another pierogi includes Pizza Penny (Red and White checkered) despite pizza not being normally ascossiated with pierogis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pirate Parrot is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979.  He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named \\"Captain Flint\\".  He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting hot-dogs from a cannon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Washington Nationals have a President Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on Mount Rushmore ÿ George Washington (\\"George\\"), Thomas Jefferson (\\"Tom\\"), Abraham Lincoln (\\"Abe\\"), and Theodore Roosevelt (\\"Teddy\\") ÿ have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant ÿ William Howard Taft (\\"Bill\\") ÿ was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. Calvin Coolidge (\\"Cal\\") was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. Herbert Hoover (\\"Herbie\\") replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place in the order in which they held the office (George ÿ 1; Tom ÿ 3; Abe ÿ 16; Teddy ÿ 26; William ÿ 27; Cal ÿ 30; Herbie ÿ 31).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Racing Presidents became an instant success upon their 2006 debut and make multiple public appearances every year. Notably, Abraham Lincoln appeared on the Illinois float for President Barack Obama's first inauguration parade on January 20, 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nA running gag with the Racing Presidents from 2006 to 2012 was that Teddy could never win a race, although he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other three presidents: While he was \\"Tebowing\\" near the finish line, George drove up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat, knocking him out before he could finish the race. In October 2012, however, just before the regular season ended and shortly before the Nationals' first postseason run began, Teddy finally won his first race, and he then went on to win four straight. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nationals scrapped plans to replace Herbie in 2017 with the president to be featured on that year's White House Historical Association Christmas ornament. Instead, they announced before the 2017 season that Bill, Cal, and Herbie all had retired to Florida, where in 2017 they began a new series of Presidents Races among themselves during Nationals spring training games at FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach. Meanwhile, the Presidents Race at Nationals Park returned in 2017 to its original format of 2006-2012, featuring only George, Tom, Abe, and Teddy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRally Squirrel is a secondary mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic squirrel wearing the team's uniform with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at Busch Stadium during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 2011 National League Division Series. The squirrel ran across home plate as Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker, causing Oswalt to complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies beginning with Game 3 of the 2011 National League Championship Series,[17] and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot Fredbird during the remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium. Since the Cardinals won the 2011 World Series, it is unknown if Rally Squirrel would become an official secondary mascot alongside Fredbird.\\r\\n\\r\\nRangers Captain is the mascot for the Texas Rangers. Introduced in 2002, he is a palomino-style horse, dressed in the team's uniform.  He wears the uniform number \\"72\\" in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex.\\r\\n\\r\\nRangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game.  However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like Elvis Presley as part of an Elvis theme promotional night.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaymond is the mascot of the Tampa Bay Rays.[18] Raymond is a furry blue creature wearing a large pair of sneakers and a backwards baseball cap, completed with a Rays jersey.  He is described officially as a \\"seadog\\", having been born somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. He is said to reside in a private condominium inside Tropicana Field.  Raymond was awarded an honorable mention in the GameOps.com Best Mascot contest for 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nRosie Red is the female mascot of the Cincinnati Reds.  She was introduced in August 2008 as the new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of \\"Rooters Organized to Stimulate Interest and Enthuiasm in the Cincinnati Reds.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s the  Hot Dog became a racer. In 2006 a fifth sausage was debuted, The Spanish Chorizo. They are a favorite of fans and make sports highlights reels occasionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nScreech is the mascot of the Washington Nationals. He is a bald eagle who wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was \\"hatched\\" on April 17, 2005 at the \\"Kids Opening Day\\" promotion at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining that it was \\"strong and eats almost everything.\\" A new \\"matured\\" edition of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The Springfield Falcons, which played in the American Hockey League until they moved to Tucson in 2016, also had a mascot named Screech.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlider is the mascot for the Cleveland Indians. He is a large, furry fuchsia-colored creature. He has a large yellow nose and shaggy yellow eyebrows.[19] He was created in 1990, inspired by the Phillie Phanatic.[20] He was best known for an injury during the 1995 American League Championship Series when he fell six feet off an outfield wall and tore knee ligaments.[citation needed] He was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nSluggerrr is the official mascot of the Kansas City Royals. The lion whose mane looks like a crown made his debut on April 5, 1996. The word slugger also refers to a powerful batter with a high percentage of extra base hits.  Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, a spectator was injured by a hot dog thrown into the stands by Sluggerrr as part of a between-innings promotion.  The spectator sued the Royals organization, claiming that they had been negligent.  A jury found that neither the team nor the fan were at fault, and awarded no damages.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouthpaw is the mascot of the Chicago White Sox. His name is a reference to a left-hand pitcher and is also a reference to Chicago's South Side, where the team plays.  He was on a float for Illinois at Barack Obama's inauguration, along with the Washington Nationals racing president representation of Abraham Lincoln.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nStomper is the mascot of the Oakland Athletics. Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A's uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several All-Star Games and has appeared in a Public Service Announcement discouraging the use of chewing tobacco.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of an elephant to symbolize the A's dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by industrialist Benjamin Shibe, became the team's first owners.  When asked to comment, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the rival National League, said something to the effect that \\"Shibe had bought himself a white elephant.\\"  In response, A's manager (and future owner) Connie Mack selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot.  From time to time an illustration of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics uniform, including from 1988 to the present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swinging Friar is the mascot of the San Diego Padres.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a minor league baseball organization.  He was named after the Spanish Franciscan friars, who founded the Mission San Diego de Alcal, around which the city of San Diego began to emerge in the 18th century.  The Padres joined Major League Baseball in 1969 and kept the popular mascot.  He was even on the team emblem until 1984.  Wanting a more \\"professional\\" image, the owners introduced a more corporate logo.  In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club's blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Swinging Friar is a cartoon-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling.  He is dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be ambidextrous, or even a switch hitter. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special camouflage cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms.  The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win.\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit.  Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome in the past have confused The San Diego Chicken as the mascot of the Padres.  Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.\\r\\n\\r\\nT. C. is the mascot for the Minnesota Twins.  He was first introduced to Minnesota on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled[citation needed] after the Hamm's Beer Bear, a mascot used in advertisements for Hamm's Brewery, an early sponsor for the Twins. The \\"T. C.\\" stands for the \\"Twin Cities\\", Minneapolis and St. Paul.[23] Prior to T.C., the mascot for the Minnesota Twins 1980ÿ81 was a loon named \\"Twinkie\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWally the Green Monster is the official mascot for the Boston Red Sox.  His name is derived from the Green Monster nickname of the 37-foot (11?m) wall in left field at Fenway Park.  Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it \\"eats up\\" hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a hermit for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named Tessie, Wally the Green Monster's little sister.[25]  Tessie is named after the song \\"Tessie\\", which has long been associated with the Red Sox.[26][27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a list of former Major League Baseball mascots. Some of these mascots may still be used, but are not considered \\"official\\" mascots.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstrojack, an anthropomorphic rabbit, and Astrodillo, an anthropomorphic armadillo, were mascots for the Houston Astros in the 1980s. They wore the Astros' \\"rainbow\\" uniforms of that time, and were also the team's first mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks between innings, they would also race around the field on three-wheelers and perform skits with the Astrodome's house band, The Astronuts. The creator of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later Astros mascot, Junction Jack.\\r\\n\\r\\nBJ Birdy served as the official mascot for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999.[28] He was ejected from a game in 1993 for \\"showing up\\" the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found offensive.[29][30] He was replaced in 1999 with Ace and Diamond. BJ was created and played by the same person, Kevin Shanahan, for his entire 20-year career as the Jays' mascot.  Shanahan lost 3 toes on his left foot in an automobile accident during the 1991 off season, but managed to return as the Jays mascot, missing only the first home game of the season.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonnie Brewer is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her \\"firing\\". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18ÿ28, 2000. As of  2008[update], Bonnie is part of the Brewers' \\"Retro Fridays\\" promotions at Miller Park, incorporating the traditional base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie's Dugout during the fans' singing of the \\"Beer Barrel Polka\\" in the seventh inning stretch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Braves Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured green shaggy fur with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended more for the entertainment of younger fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mascot was costumed by Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5\\"8\\" to 5'10\\" tall, and Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one of his costume's eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades.\\r\\n\\r\\nStensland was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really \\"funky smell\\" permeated the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharlie-O the Mule was the mascot used by the Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A's from 1963 to 1976. The mule was named after their colorful owner at that time, Charles O. Finley.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the A's moved to then heavily Democratic Missouri, where the official state animal is the mule, Warren Hearnes gave a mule to Finley for his barnyard menagerie at Municipal Stadium which also include sheep and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field.[31] The Municipal Stadium menagerie also included Warpaint, the horse mascot of the Kansas City Chiefs.  As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A's logo and changed the A's colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and white.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinley took the sorrel 5-foot-tall (1.5?m) mule around the country, walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge.  Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse.  Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \\"Charge!\\"  The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Noc-A-Homa was the original mascot of the Atlanta Braves from the 1950s until 1986. The name was used for the \\"laughing Indian\\" sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. From at least the early 1960s, while still in Milwaukee County Stadium, until the early 1980s at Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, this mascot \\"lived\\" in a teepee in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe teepee was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove the chief's home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee was returned to its spot and the team won the division.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition to Native American mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually replace him with Homer The Brave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Crazy Crab was a mascot of the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy Crab was meant as an \\"anti-mascot\\", satirizing on the mascot craze that was going on at the time.  Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot (played by actor Wayne Doba) and manager Frank Robinson appeared in a commercial with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him.  This encouragement may have worked too well, as Giants fans regularly threw various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, and Crazy Crab's suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for protection.[32] The crab was so hated, players on both the Giants and even the opposition would throw rosin bags and other objects at the mascot.  Doba sued the San Diego Padres after two of their players (Kurt Bevacqua and Bruce Bochy) tackled him, causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. The crab returned for the last game at Candlestick Park that the Giants played in 1999, and a bobblehead was given away with its likeness July 18, 2008 as the franchise celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in the Bay Area. There is even a website devoted to bringing back the Crazy Crab called Rehab The Crab [33] and now a Crazy Crab sandwich at AT&T Park. In 2014, Colin Hanks directed The Anti-Mascot, an ESPN 30 for 30 short about Crazy Crab.[34] On July 7, 2018, the Crazy Crab made its AT&T Park debut in honor of the Giants' Crazy Crab scarf giveaway. [35]\\r\\n\\r\\nDandy was a short-lived mascot of the New York Yankees. He was a large pinstriped bird-like mascot that sported a Yankees hat.  He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher Sparky Lyle.  His name was a play on the classic American folk song \\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\\".  He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular that he was quickly canceled.  Dandy was beaten up by fans who didn't want a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the Yankees chose not to replace him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field, although the late Freddy Schuman has served as an unofficial promoter in the stands for decades, and a squirrel appearing on the field has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team.\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneral Admission (a pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the Astrodome) was a mascot for the Houston Astros in the mid-to-late 1990s.  He was played by a middle-aged white male and wore a traditional U.S. Cavalry uniform complete with gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit in the dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run, General Admission would fire a cannon from his outfield platform (that would often scare those seated near him). He was \\"killed off\\" at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate game of the regular season.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHomer was the mascot of the Atlanta Braves.  He had a baseball shaped head, and looked a little like Mr. Met. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification of the old \\"Screaming Warrior\\" logo the Braves used before dropping it in 1988.\\r\\n\\r\\nHomer's full name was Homer the Brave. This was meant to sound like \\"home of the brave\\", the last words of the national anthem. Incidentally, \\"homer\\" was also the longtime nickname for a home run.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunction Jack was the mascot character for the Houston Astros from 2000 until 2012. He was a 7-foot-tall (2.1?m) rabbit dressed as a railroad engineer. His \\"relatives\\" were Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the Astros.\\r\\n\\r\\nJunction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the Astrodome to Minute Maid Park.  The new stadium was originally called \\"The Ballpark at Union Station\\" because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston.  In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer.  The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012.  Orbit's return coincided with the Astros' move to the American League West as well as their new uniforms, caps, and logo.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarry, a Bull Terrier, was the mascot for the Cleveland Naps in the 1910s, cared for by player Jack Graney.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore their retirement in 2014, Lefty and Righty were each a large, red sock with arms, and before Tessie the Green Monster's introduction in 2016,[37] were the alternate mascot characters for the Boston Red Sox through the 2014 MLB season, joining Wally the Green Monster. They were seen on large outings with Wally such as the 2007 World Series Parade as well as weekend afternoon games at Fenway Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nMettle the Mule was a mascot of the New York Mets for a short time starting in 1976.[38]  Originally named Arthur, Mettle was renamed as a result of a fan contest.  Mettle was kept in a pen near the Mets' bullpen in the right field of Shea Stadium.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhiladelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis served as mascots for the Phillies during the 1970s (1971ÿ79). Their costumes invoked the city's revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair reappeared with their replacementthe Phanaticas the Phillies celebrated their final year at Veterans Stadium in 2003, including the final opening day and final game.\\r\\n\\r\\nRally was one of the Atlanta Braves mascots. He was a bear-like mascot and looked like Wally the Green Monster.\\r\\n\\r\\nRibbie and Roobarb were a pair of mascots used by the Chicago White Sox from 1981 to 1988 at Comiskey Park. After the Sox were sold in 1981 by Bill Veeck to an ownership group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, the new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey debuted the pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the teamboth because of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate Andy the Clown, who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. \\"Rhubarb\\" is longtime baseball slang for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes from the acronym RBI, for runs batted in. Often reports will say ribbie instead of RBI to describe it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor most of the 1980s, the patrons at Comiskey Park ... were asked to endure the 'antics' of baseball's least appealing mascots, Ribbie and Roobarb. One looked like the dim-witted son of Oscar the Grouch, the other like a chartreuse anteater with a genetic flaw.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter another failed mascot in the early 1990s was  Waldo the White Sox Wolf. The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2003.\\r\\n\\r\\nScoop and Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 2002 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouki was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, for only one season (1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. Met, but with one difference. The Expos' Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a loss).\\r\\n\\r\\nTwinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 1981.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouppi! was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, before the franchise moved to Washington as the Washington Nationals. He is an orange furry creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by Bonnie Erickson, formerly a designer for some of Jim Henson's Muppets characters. Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase Yippee! or Hooray! in French. Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors' dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later returned, confined to the home team's dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned as a mascot after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but was adopted by the NHL's Montreal Canadiens team on September 16, 2005, as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from one sport to another, while remaining in the same city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following MLB teams do not currently have an official mascot:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Build-A-Bear Workshop\\" Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store, at Citizens Bank Park, was the first store of its kind in sports.
