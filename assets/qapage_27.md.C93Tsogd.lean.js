The protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.\\r\\nMetamorphic rocks make up a large part of the Earth's crust and form 12% of the Earth's land surface.[3] They are classified by texture and by chemical and mineral assemblage (metamorphic facies). They may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock layers above it. They can form from tectonic processes such as continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction and distortion. They are also formed when rock is heated by the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth's interior. The study of metamorphic rocks (now exposed at the Earth's surface following erosion and uplift) provides information about the temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the Earth's crust. Some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, slate, marble, schist, and quartzite.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMetamorphic minerals are those that form only at the high temperatures and pressures associated with the process of metamorphism. These minerals, known as index minerals, include sillimanite, kyanite, staurolite, andalusite, and some garnet.\\r\\nOther minerals, such as olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, feldspars, and quartz, may be found in metamorphic rocks, but are not necessarily the result of the process of metamorphism. These minerals formed during the crystallization of igneous rocks. They are stable at high temperatures and pressures and may remain chemically unchanged during the metamorphic process. However, all minerals are stable only within certain limits, and the presence of some minerals in metamorphic rocks indicates the approximate temperatures and pressures at which they formed.\\r\\nThe change in the particle size of the rock during the process of metamorphism is called recrystallization. For instance, the small calcite crystals in the sedimentary rock limestone and chalk change into larger crystals in the metamorphic rock marble; in metamorphosed sandstone, recrystallization of the original quartz sand grains results in very compact quartzite, also known as metaquartzite, in which the often larger quartz crystals are interlocked. Both high temperatures and pressures contribute to recrystallization. High temperatures allow the atoms and ions in solid crystals to migrate, thus reorganizing the crystals, while high pressures cause solution of the crystals within the rock at their point of contact.\\r\\nThe layering within metamorphic rocks is called foliation (derived from the Latin word folia, meaning \\"leaves\\"), and it occurs when a rock is being shortened along one axis during recrystallization. This causes the platy or elongated crystals of minerals, such as mica and chlorite, to become rotated such that their long axes are perpendicular to the orientation of shortening. This results in a banded, or foliated rock, with the bands showing the colors of the minerals that formed them.\\r\\nTextures are separated into foliated and non-foliated categories. Foliated rock is a product of differential stress that deforms the rock in one plane, sometimes creating a plane of cleavage. For example, slate is a foliated metamorphic rock, originating from shale. Non-foliated rock does not have planar patterns of strain.\\r\\nRocks that were subjected to uniform pressure from all sides, or those that lack minerals with distinctive growth habits, will not be foliated. Where a rock has been subject to differential stress, the type of foliation that develops depends on the metamorphic grade. For instance, starting with a mudstone, the following sequence develops with increasing temperature: slate is a very fine-grained, foliated metamorphic rock, characteristic of very low grade metamorphism, while phyllite is fine-grained and found in areas of low grade metamorphism, schist is medium to coarse-grained and found in areas of medium grade metamorphism, and gneiss coarse to very coarse-grained, found in areas of high-grade metamorphism.[4] Marble is generally not foliated, which allows its use as a material for sculpture and architecture.\\r\\nAnother important mechanism of metamorphism is that of chemical reactions that occur between minerals without them melting. In the process atoms are exchanged between the minerals, and thus new minerals are formed. Many complex high-temperature reactions may take place, and each mineral assemblage produced provides us with a clue as to the temperatures and pressures at the time of metamorphism.\\r\\nMetasomatism is the drastic change in the bulk chemical composition of a rock that often occurs during the processes of metamorphism. It is due to the introduction of chemicals from other surrounding rocks. Water may transport these chemicals rapidly over great distances. Because of the role played by water, metamorphic rocks generally contain many elements absent from the original rock, and lack some that originally were present. Still, the introduction of new chemicals is not necessary for recrystallization to occur.\\r\\nContact metamorphism is the name given to the changes that take place when magma is injected into the surrounding solid rock (country rock). The changes that occur are greatest wherever the magma comes into contact with the rock because the temperatures are highest at this boundary and decrease with distance from it. Around the igneous rock that forms from the cooling magma is a metamorphosed zone called a contact metamorphism aureole. Aureoles may show all degrees of metamorphism from the contact area to unmetamorphosed (unchanged) country rock some distance away. The formation of important ore minerals may occur by the process of metasomatism at or near the contact zone.\\r\\nWhen a rock is contact altered by an igneous intrusion it very frequently becomes more indurated, and more coarsely crystalline. Many altered rocks of this type were formerly called hornstones, and the term hornfels is often used by geologists to signify those fine grained, compact, non-foliated products of contact metamorphism. A shale may become a dark argillaceous hornfels, full of tiny plates of brownish biotite; a marl or impure limestone may change to a grey, yellow or greenish lime-silicate-hornfels or siliceous marble, tough and splintery, with abundant augite, garnet, wollastonite and other minerals in which calcite is an important component. A diabase or andesite may become a diabase hornfels or andesite hornfels with development of new hornblende and biotite and a partial recrystallization of the original feldspar. Chert or flint may become a finely crystalline quartz rock; sandstones lose their clastic structure and are converted into a mosaic of small close-fitting grains of quartz in a metamorphic rock called quartzite.\\r\\nIf the rock was originally banded or foliated (as, for example, a laminated sandstone or a foliated calc-schist) this character may not be obliterated, and a banded hornfels is the product; fossils even may have their shapes preserved, though entirely recrystallized, and in many contact-altered lavas the vesicles are still visible, though their contents have usually entered into new combinations to form minerals that were not originally present. The minute structures, however, disappear, often completely, if the thermal alteration is very profound. Thus small grains of quartz in a shale are lost or blend with the surrounding particles of clay, and the fine ground-mass of lavas is entirely reconstructed.\\r\\nBy recrystallization in this manner peculiar rocks of very distinct types are often produced. Thus shales may pass into cordierite rocks, or may show large crystals of andalusite (and chiastolite), staurolite, garnet, kyanite and sillimanite, all derived from the aluminous content of the original shale. A considerable amount of mica (both muscovite and biotite) is often simultaneously formed, and the resulting product has a close resemblance to many kinds of schist. Limestones, if pure, are often turned into coarsely crystalline marbles; but if there was an admixture of clay or sand in the original rock such minerals as garnet, epidote, idocrase, wollastonite, will be present. Sandstones when greatly heated may change into coarse quartzites composed of large clear grains of quartz. These more intense stages of alteration are not so commonly seen in igneous rocks, because their minerals, being formed at high temperatures, are not so easily transformed or recrystallized.\\r\\nIn a few cases rocks are fused and in the dark glassy product minute crystals of spinel, sillimanite and cordierite may separate out. Shales are occasionally thus altered by basalt dikes, and feldspathic sandstones may be completely vitrified. Similar changes may be induced in shales by the burning of coal seams or even by an ordinary furnace.\\r\\nThere is also a tendency for metasomatism between the igneous magma and sedimentary country rock, whereby the chemicals in each are exchanged or introduced into the other. Granites may absorb fragments of shale or pieces of basalt. In that case, hybrid rocks called skarn arise, which don't have the characteristics of normal igneous or sedimentary rocks. Sometimes an invading granite magma permeates the rocks around, filling their joints and planes of bedding, etc., with threads of quartz and feldspar. This is very exceptional but instances of it are known and it may take place on a large scale.[5]\\r\\nRegional metamorphism, also known as dynamic metamorphism, is the name given to changes in great masses of rock over a wide area. Rocks can be metamorphosed simply by being at great depths below the Earth's surface, subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure caused by the immense weight of the rock layers above. Much of the lower continental crust is metamorphic, except for recent igneous intrusions. Horizontal tectonic movements such as the collision of continents create orogenic belts, and cause high temperatures, pressures and deformation in the rocks along these belts. If the metamorphosed rocks are later uplifted and exposed by erosion, they may occur in long belts or other large areas at the surface. The process of metamorphism may have destroyed the original features that could have revealed the rock's previous history. Recrystallization of the rock will destroy the textures and fossils present in sedimentary rocks. Metasomatism will change the original composition.\\r\\nRegional metamorphism tends to make the rock more indurated and at the same time to give it a foliated, shistose or gneissic texture, consisting of a planar arrangement of the minerals, so that platy or prismatic minerals like mica and hornblende have their longest axes arranged parallel to one another. For that reason many of these rocks split readily in one direction along mica-bearing zones (schists). In gneisses, minerals also tend to be segregated into bands; thus there are seams of quartz and of mica in a mica schist, very thin, but consisting essentially of one mineral. Along the mineral layers composed of soft or fissile minerals the rocks will split most readily, and the freshly split specimens will appear to be faced or coated with this mineral; for example, a piece of mica schist looked at facewise might be supposed to consist entirely of shining scales of mica. On the edge of the specimens, however, the white folia of granular quartz will be visible. In gneisses these alternating folia are sometimes thicker and less regular than in schists, but most importantly less micaceous; they may be lenticular, dying out rapidly. Gneisses also, as a rule, contain more feldspar than schists do, and are tougher and less fissile. Contortion or crumbling of the foliation is by no means uncommon; splitting faces are undulose or puckered. Schistosity and gneissic banding (the two main types of foliation) are formed by directed pressure at elevated temperature, and to interstitial movement, or internal flow arranging the mineral particles while they are crystallizing in that directed pressure field.\\r\\nRocks that were originally sedimentary and rocks that were undoubtedly igneous may be metamorphosed into schists and gneisses. If originally of similar composition they may be very difficult to distinguish from one another if the metamorphism has been great. A quartz-porphyry, for example, and a fine feldspathic sandstone, may both be metamorphosed into a grey or pink mica-schist.[5]\\r\\nThe five basic metamorphic textures with typical rock types are slaty (includes slate and phyllite; the foliation is called \\"slaty cleavage\\"), schistose (includes schist; the foliation is called \\"schistosity\\"), gneissose (gneiss; the foliation is called \\"gneissosity\\"), granoblastic (includes granulite, some marbles and quartzite), and hornfelsic (includes hornfels and skarn).","input":"What type of metamorphic rock is formed from limestone?"},{"output":"Eduardo Jos Padr܇n","context":"Eduardo Jos Padr܇n (born June 26, 1944)[1] is the president of Miami Dade College (MDC).

Since then, the Puerto Rican government has declared English an official language on several occasions while removing it from that status on as many occasions.\\r\\nSpanish is the most widely spoken and written language,[1] and the vast majority of Puerto Ricans do not use English regularly other than some borrowed English words during their ordinary Spanish-language speech.[2] Various surveys have found that the majority of Puerto Ricans are not fully fluent in English.[3][4] The 2000 US Census found that 71.9% of people in Puerto Rico spoke English less than \\"very well.\\"[5] It also found that 85.6% spoke a language other than English at home (mostly Spanish).[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. seized the island from Spain in 1898, and in 1902 as part of the Foraker Act, the Official Languages Act was instituted mandating that English and Spanish should be \\"used indiscriminately\\" in all official and public activities, with translation provided as necessary. Some interpret this as part of an Americanization process, others as a necessity for the functioning of the Executive Council in charge of Puerto Rico at the time, of which few or none of the mainland appointees spoke Spanish.[6]\\r\\nAfter the SpanishÿAmerican War, English was the sole language used by the military government of Puerto Rico, which consisted of officials appointed by the US Government. On 21 February 1902 a law was passed to use both English and Spanish as co-official languages in the government.[7] When the new political status, the Commonwealth, came into effect in 1952, the Constitution stated nothing about the official language that would be used by the new government.\\r\\nIn 1991 the government of Puerto Rico, under the administration of PPD's Rafael Hernndez Col܇n, made Spanish its sole official language through a law that was commonly called the \\"Spanish-only Law.\\"[8] In recognition of the historical defense of the Spanish language and culture, the Spanish Monarchy awarded Puerto Rico the Principe de Asturias' Prize that same year.[9] On January 4, 1993, the 12th Legislative Assembly, with the support of the newly elected PNP government of Pedro Rossell܇ Gonzlez passed Senate Bill 1, establishing both Spanish and English as official languages of the government of Puerto Rico.[10]\\r\\nIn 2007, the Spanish-language newspaper Hoy reported that Spanish was still used on road signs such as \\"Pare\\" (Stop) and \\"Estacionamiento\\" (Parking), despite U.S. attempts to \\"impose\\" English on Puerto Rico since 1898.[11] However, in 2009, the grassroots community cultural organization Unidos por Nuestro Idioma (\\"United for our language\\"), whose goal is \\"defending Spanish in Puerto Rico\\", expressed concern that the use of English terms on official road signs reading Welcome to Guaynabo City, and on mass transit (City Hall and Downtown) as well as police cruisers (San Juan Police Department) were evidence of the English language replacing Spanish in official use. The group advocates the defense and use of Spanish in Puerto Rico. The group states it is not against the use of English, recognizing the importance of Puerto Ricans learning it, but states that it should not displace Spanish.[12]\\r\\nThe same 21 February 1902 law that ordered the use of both English and Spanish as co-official languages in the government of Puerto Rico also made English the obligatory language of instruction in Puerto Rican high schools.[7] This practice, however, was officially modified in 1948, when English was required in schools only as a second language, and not as a language of instruction in all academic high school subjects.[13] The new 1948 practice was the result of a 1947 decree by Education Commissioner Mario Villaronga ordering that Spanish be the language of instruction for all but the English course. The decree is binding only on public schools and private schools continue the use of English.[14]\\r\\nThe official languages[15] of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico[16] are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, even despite a 1902 English-only language law.[17] All official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, however, is conducted in English.[18][19]\\r\\nAlthough English is one of the two official (i.e., governmental) languages in Puerto Rico, it is spoken by less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by over 95% of the population.[20] That is, Spanish predominates as the national language. Regardless of the status of English as an official language or not, Spanish continues to be by far the most widely spoken and written language by the Puerto Rican people at large, and the vast majority of Puerto Ricans do not use English regularly other than some loaned English words during their ordinary Spanish-language speech.[2] Various surveys have found that the majority of Puerto Ricans are not fully fluent in English.[3][4] The 2000 US Census found that 71.9% of people in Puerto Rico spoke English less than \\"very well.\\"[5] It also found that 85.6% spoke a language other than English at home (mostly Spanish).[5]\\r\\nAccording to a 2009 study by the University of Puerto Rico, nine of every ten Puerto Ricans residing in Puerto Rico do not speak English at an advanced level.[21] More recently, according to the 2005ÿ2009 Population and Housing Narrative Profile for Puerto Rico, among people at least five years old living in Puerto Rico in 2005ÿ2009, 95 percent spoke a language other than English at home. Of those speaking a language other than English at home, more than 99 percent spoke Spanish and less than 0.5 percent spoke some other language; 85 percent reported that they did not speak English \\"very well.\\"[22] The 2000 U.S. Census had reported that 71.9% of Puerto Rico residents spoke English less than \\"very well\\".[23]\\r\\nPublic school instruction in Puerto Rico is conducted entirely in Spanish. In 2012, however, there were pilot programs in about a dozen of over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only.[24] English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. In 2012 pro-U.S. statehood Governor Luis Fortu?o proposed that all courses in Puerto Rico public schools be taught in English instead of Spanish as they currently are. The proposal met with stiff opposition from the Puerto Rico Teachers Association while others, including former Education Secretary Gloria Baquero, were pessimistic about the success of the governor's plan overall for reasons that ranged from historical to cultural to political.[25] This 10-year plan is still underway, but there are some private schools that already have existing English-based curriculums. Washburn School, located in the city of Ponce, Puerto Rico, is a private, multi-cultural, total English immersion school for grades Pre-K to 12th. All classes are taught in English, with the exception of Spanish class, foreign language classes and Puerto Rican history class. The purpose of such private institutions is to provide students with full bilingual knowledge and ability, and to prepare students for the demands of collegiate school, both in Puerto Rico and outside.[26]\\r\\nThe presence and influence of the English language in Puerto Rico was inevitable. Because of the islands current relationship with the U.S., the presence of English is vast and is seen in all sorts of media outlets including: newspapers, magazines, cable TV, radio stations, commercial signs, etc.[27] As a result of this exposure, Puerto Ricans often mix elements of the English language into their own Spanish language, developing new linguistic forms. This kind of incorporation of English into Puerto Rican Spanish is called anglicism, and three prominent forms of anglicism present in Puerto Rico are total linguistic borrowing, semantic borrowing, and syntactical borrowing.[28] [28]\\r\\nTotal linguistic borrowing occurs when an English word is used in Spanish with more or less the same pronunciation. A few examples in which the complete English word has been borrowed are: flash light, Girl Scout, and weekend. The correct Spanish word for these are linterna elctrica, ni?a escucha, and fin de semana, respectively. Examples in which the English words or terms are used while pronounced according to the native rules are seen for the English word/term to park, where it is said and pronounced as parquear, instead of the correct Spanish word for to park which is estacionar. Other examples of this are the English word pamphlet, said as panfleto instead of folleto, and the English word muffler, said as mofle instead as silenciador.[28]\\r\\nIn semantic borrowing, the meaning of a Spanish word is altered or changed because of its similarity to an English word. For example, the Spanish word romance means language, however, it has been given the English meaning of the English word romance. The Spanish word for romance is actually idilio. Another example of this is the Spanish word bloques, which means building blocks, but is giving the English meaning of street blocks. The actual Spanish word that means street blocks is cuadras. [28]\\r\\nIn syntactical borrowing, Spanish words are used in an English sentence structure. For example, in Spanish, personal pronoun subjects are not included as frequently as in English: I run is often said as yo corro instead as corro. Another example: He has cordially invited his friend is often said as El ha cordialmente invitado a su amigo instead of El ha invitado cordialmente a su amigo.\\" There is a phonological influence of American English on Puerto Rican Spanish, wherein syllable-final /r/ can be realized as [?], aside from [?], [r], and [l]; \\"verso\\"' (verse) becomes [?be?so], aside from [?be?so], [?berso], or [?belso], \\"invierno\\" (winter) becomes [im?bje?no], aside from [im?bje?no], [im?bjerno], or [im?bjelno], and \\"parlamento\\" (parliament) becomes [pa?la?mento], aside from [pa?la?mento], [parla?mento], or [pala?mento]. In word-final position, /r/ will usually be;\\r\\nThere is an important influence of Puerto Rican Spanish on the accent of American English. As with any other case of a non-native learning a language, many Puerto Ricans learn a particular accent of English. If learned in the US, they may speak English as it is spoken in their region. Some Puerto Ricans still residing in the island acquire a distinctly American accent when speaking. Others will develop different variations of the accent depending on who or what the main influence was during the learning process. This is due not only to the fact that English is taught from the first grade in most schools, but also that most English teachers (particularly private school teachers) are very fluent in the language.\\r\\nResidents of areas with large populations of African descendants such as Loiza, or the islands of Vieques and Culebra, tend to acquire a distinct Caribbean accent when speaking English, similar to that of nearby islands in the West Indies, most notably the nearby Virgin Islands, but remained based on American English by phonology. A Puerto Rican's accent depends entirely on who or what was the main influence during the learning process of the English language. Because of this, there is no definitive Puerto Rican accent in English.\\r\\nIn 2012 U.S. presidential candidate Rick Santorum caused a firestorm during the runup to the Puerto Rican Republican primary by stating that if Puerto Rico opted to become a state, it would have to make English its primary language. As the New York Times reported:[29]\\r\\nHis remarks drew immediate criticism, and prompted one delegate who had been pledged to him to quit, saying he was offended. There is no rule in the Constitution requiring the adoption of English for the admittance of new states, and the United States does not have an official language.\\r\\nOn Thursday Mr. Santorum and his aides scrambled to contain the damage, with the candidate saying several times that the local media had misquoted him as saying he wanted English to be the only language, whereas he believed that English should be the primary language.\\r\\nSantorum opponent Mitt Romney's campaign issued a statement contrasting his position on the issue with Santorum's. \\"Puerto Rico currently recognizes both English and Spanish as the official languages of the commonwealth,\\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. \\"Gov. Romney believes that English is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand English proficiency in Puerto Rico and across America. However, he would not, as a prerequisite for statehood, require that the people of Puerto Rico cease using Spanish.\\"[30]","input":"What are the two offical languages of puerto rico?"},{"output":"Aryabhata","context":"Aryabhata (Hindi: ??????) was India's first satellite,[1] named after an Indian astronomer of the same name.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was launched by India on 19 April 1975[1] from Kapustin Yar, a Russian rocket launch and development site in Astrakhan Oblast using a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle.

In 2005, Afghanistan began negotiating their accession to SAARC and formally applied for membership on the same year.[21][22] The issue of Afghanistan joining SAARC generated a great deal of debate in each member state, including concerns about the definition of South Asian identity because Afghanistan is a Central Asian country.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC member states imposed a stipulation for Afghanistan to hold a general election; the non-partisan elections were held in late 2005.[23] Despite initial reluctance and internal debates, Afghanistan joined SAARC as its eighth member state in April 2007.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nStates with observer status include[25] Australia,[26] China, the European Union,[27] Iran, Japan,[27] Mauritius,[28] Myanmar, South Korea and the United States.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 August 2006, the foreign ministers of the SAARC countries agreed in principle to grant observer status to three applicants;[30] the US and South Korea (both made requests in April 2006),[30] as well as the European Union (requested in July 2006).[31] On 4 March 2007, Iran requested observer status,[32] followed shortly by Mauritius.\\r\\n\\r\\nMyanmar has expressed interest in upgrading its status from an observer to a full member of SAARC.[33] Russia has applied for observer status membership of SAARC.[34][35][36] Turkey applied for observer status membership of SAARC in 2012.[34][35][36] South Africa has participated in meetings.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Secretariat was established in Kathmandu on 16 January 1987 and was inaugurated by Late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Secretariat is supported by following Regional Centres established in the Member States to promote regional co-operation. These Centres are managed by Governing Boards comprising representatives from all the Member States, SAARC Secretary-General and the Ministry of Foreign/External Affairs of the Host Government. The Director of the Centre acts as Member Secretary to the Governing Board which reports to the Programming Committee. After 31 December 2015, there 6 regional centers were stopped by unanimous decision. These are SMRC, SFC, SDC, SCZMC, SIC, SHRDC.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSAARC has six Apex Bodies,[40] they are-\\r\\n\\r\\nAmjad Hussain B Sial is the current  Secretary General of SAARC.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAARC also has about 17 recognised bodies.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nLasting peace and prosperity in South Asia has been elusive because of the various ongoing conflicts in the region. Political dialogue is often conducted on the margins of SAARC meetings which have refrained from interfering in the internal matters of its member states.[42] During the 12th and 13th SAARC summits, extreme emphasis was laid upon greater cooperation between the SAARC members to fight terrorism.[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 19th SAARC summit scheduled to be held in Pakistan was called off as India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan decided to boycott it.[45][46] It was for the first time that four countries boycotted a SAARC summit, leading to its cancellation.[47][48]\\r\\n\\r\\nSAFTA was envisaged primarily as the first step towards the transition to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) leading subsequently towards a Customs Union, Common Market and the Economic Union. In 1995, Sixteenth session of the Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18ÿ19 December 1995) agreed on the need to strive for the realisation of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental Expert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for progressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 29ÿ31 July 1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in mind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit held in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 2006, and the Trade Liberalisation Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under this agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by 2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council (SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member States.[49] In 2012 the SAARC exports increased substantially to US$354.6 billion from US$206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from US$330 billion to US$602 billion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a little over 1% of SAARC's GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in ASEAN (which is actually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-bloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.\\r\\n\\r\\nSAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic Union, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not encouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. The SAARC intra-regional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional trade in overall trade in South Asia. Similarly, foreign direct investment is also dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the total foreign investment.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Asian Development Bank has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC region possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14 billion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study by Asian Development Bank states that against the potential average SAARC intra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia has been only around $8 billion. The uncaptured potential for intra-regional trade is therefore $14 billion per year, i.e. 68%.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was launched in 1992.  The leaders at the Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29ÿ31 December 1988), realizing the importance of people-to-people contact among SAARC countries, decided that certain categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document. The document would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of entitled categories.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include dignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials, entrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled categories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Twelfth Summit approved the SAARC Award to support individuals and organisations within the region. The main aims of the SAARC Award are:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Award consists of a gold medal, a letter of citation, and cash prize of US $25,000 (?15 lakhs).  Since the institution of the SAARC Award in 2004, it has been awarded only once and the Award was posthumously conferred upon the late President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Literary Award is an annual award conferred by the Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature (FOSWAL) since 2001[55][56] which is an apex SAARC body.[57] Shamshur Rahman, Mahasweta Devi, Jayanta Mahapatra,  Abhi Subedi, Mark Tully, Sitakant Mahapatra, Uday Prakash, Suman Pokhrel and Abhay K are some of the prominent recipients of this award.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nNepali poet, lyricist, and translator Suman Pokhrel is the only poet/writer to get this award twice.[59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe SAARC Youth Award is awarded to outstanding individuals from the SAARC region. The award is notable because of the recognition it gives to the Award winner in the SAARC region. The award is based on specific themes which apply to each year. The award recognises and promotes the commitment and talent of the youth who give back to the world at large through various initiatives such as Inventions, Protection of the Environment and Disaster relief. The recipients who receive this award are ones who have dedicated their lives to their individual causes to improve situations in their own countries as well as paving a path for the SAARC region to follow.\\r\\nThe Committee for the SAARC Youth Award selects the best candidate based on his/her merits and their decision is final.[60]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrevious Winners:\\r\\n\\r\\nSAARC does not have an official anthem like some other regional organisations (e.g. ASEAN).[61] A poem by poet-diplomat Abhay Kumar spurred a search for a better SAARC anthem.[62] Nepal's foreign minister has expressed the need for an SAARC anthem to connect SAARC nations.[63] Nepal at the 18th summit in Kathmandu in November 2014 planned to introduce proposal for an SAARC Anthem in the agenda of summit when heads of all member states meet here.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\n Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani\\r\\n\\r\\n Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\\r\\n\\r\\n Bhutan Acting Prime Minister Dasho Tshering Wangchuk\\r\\n\\r\\n IndiaPrime Minister Narendra Modi\\r\\n\\r\\n Maldives President Abdulla Yameen\\r\\n\\r\\n Nepal Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli\\r\\n\\r\\n Sri Lanka President Maithripala Sirisena\\r\\n\\r\\n Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan","input":"Full form of s a a r c?"},{"output":"Justin Hurwitz","context":"La La Land: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the 2016 film La La Land.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognizes seven levels of education in its International Standard Classification of Education system (ISCED, from Level 0 (pre-primary education) through Level 6 (second stage of tertiary education)). UNESCO's International Bureau of Education maintains a database of country-specific education systems and their stages.[1]\\r\\nEducation during childhood and early adulthood is typically provided through either a two- or three-stage system of childhood school, followed by additional stages of higher education or vocational education for those who continue their formal education:\\r\\nThe following table introduces the main concepts, although terms and ages may vary in different places:\\r\\nFor additional ISCED stages of education, see ISCED.\\r\\nSudbury schools do not use formal grade levels or educational stages. Instead, students ages 4 through 18 are intermingled in a democratic educational system, relying on a series of certifications to use equipment that may require specialized knowledge or safety procedures. These certifications are not typically restricted by age, but rather by demonstrated ability.[2]\\r\\nIn Australia, children undergo thirteen years of formal education (plus non-compulsory preschool or kindergarten), usually starting at age 4, 5 or 6, and finishing at age 16, 17 or 18.

In Brazil, after the name of the grade one may use the names \\"srie\\" or \\"ano.\\" The educational stages in Brazil are divided as follows:\\r\\nIn Canada, schooling officially begins at Kindergarten (or Maternelle in Quebec), followed by grades, with some variations for certain levels in certain provinces/territories. When referred to as a grade, school years are usually referred to by their cardinal number (\\"Grade Three\\").\\r\\nAt the post-secondary level in (Anglophone) Canada, a student is usually referred to by the year of study they are in (i.e. First Year, Second Year, etc.). If they are pursuing something higher than an undergraduate degree, the designation usually refers to what year of study they are in since entering Graduate studies (i.e. First Year Graduate Student, etc.). Any student who has completed their first year of undergraduate studies is considered to be an Upper Year Student.\\r\\nEach province and territory has its own autonomous education system. As such, the name of each level of education and what year each level begins at will vary across the country (as will the curriculum itself).\\r\\nThe following table shows how grades are organized in various provinces. Often, there will be exceptions within each province, both with terminology for groups, and which grades apply to each group.\\r\\nIn the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), the years are organized in three stages and renumbered within each stage: 6 years in elementary school () years 1 to 6, then 3 years in lower secondary (׫, abbreviated ) years 7 to 9, then 3 years in higher secondary (ԃ׫, abbreviated ԃ) years 1 to 3. The first nine years (elementary 1ÿ6 and junior secondary 1ÿ3) are compulsory, and the years in higher secondary school are voluntary. Completing higher secondary education or attaining an equivalent level is required before one may receive higher education (ԃÛՏS) at universities.\\r\\nThe Hong Kong system was based on the United Kingdom system, with an optional year at kindergarten, six years of primary school (?W) and six years of secondary school (?W), followed by four years at university. Primary 1?ÿ 6 (֫?ÿ ־) corresponds to Years 1?ÿ 6 in the UK, and Forms 1?ÿ 6 (?ÿ ) correspond to Years 7?ÿ 12.

The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964ÿ66.\\r\\nThe Indian government lays emphasis on primary education, also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old. Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions.However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions.80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country.\\r\\nSecondary education covers children aged 12 to 18, a group comprising 8.85 crore children according to the 2001 Census of India. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \\"+2\\" stage. The two halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses.\\r\\nUGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams.

Prior to 1940ÿ1950, the education system had consisted of three levels, called in order: an optional year in kindergarten, six years of primary school, finally followed by six years of secondary school ending up with a diploma. After some improvements during Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, the system was changed to four consecutive periods: two optional years in kindergarten and pre-primary school, primary school consisting of 5 years, 3 years in middle school, and finally four years in high school. The system ended up by honoring a diploma in certain majors, e.g. math and physics.\\r\\nAround 1996ÿ1997, one year was reduced from the entire education system and one was honored with a diploma after three years in high school. However, if one would have liked to continue her/his education towards university degrees, one would have been required to take the last year, so called pre-university year. This year had been a requirement to participate in the Iranian University Entrance Exam for high school students. Again, around 2012, the system turned back to its previous system, consisting of two 6-year periods.\\r\\nIn the Republic of Ireland, there are two levels of compulsory education; primary school (ca.5ÿ12 years of age) and secondary school (ca.12ÿ18 years).

Year 1?ÿ 3 are classified as Level One (Tahap Satu in Malay) while Year 4?ÿ 6 make up Level Two (Tahap Dua). Primary schooling usually begins at the age of 7 and ends at 12. Students take their first national examination, the UPSR, towards the end of the Year 6 school year. Performance in the UPSR has no effect on their resuming schooling; all students continue with their secondary education after leaving primary school.\\r\\nSecondary schooling usually begins at age 13. Secondary schools offer education for a total of five years, starting with Form 1 and finishing at Form 5. Forms 1?ÿ 3 are grouped together into the \\"Lower Form\\" and Forms 4 & 5 are considered the \\"Upper Form\\". Students in Form 3 will have to sit for their second national exam, the PT3. They are then streamed into sciences or humanities classes for the Upper Form according to their performance in this exam. At age 17 students in Form 5 sit for the final level of national examinations, the SPM (Malaysian Certificate of Education). Achieving a passing grade in the Bahasa Melayu (Malay Language) portion of the exams is compulsory; failure results in an automatic failing grade for all subjects taken in the examination and the student is held back to repeat Form 5. Completion of the examination signifies that the student has completed formal education in Malaysia; an SPM certificate remains the base requirement to secure most jobs in Malaysia.\\r\\nAfter the SPM, students have a choice of either continuing with Form 6 (which comprises 2 years, Lower and Upper Six) or entering matriculation (pre-university programs). If they opt for Form 6, they will be required to take the STPM examination. Although generally taken by those desiring to attend public universities in Malaysia, an STPM certification is internationally recognized and may also be used, though rarely required, to enter private local universities for undergraduate courses.\\r\\nIn Nepal, the stages of education are primary education, secondary education, and higher secondary. Pre-primary education is also found in some areas. Generally, the pre-primary level covers nursery and kindergarten. Primary education consists of grades one through five, while lower secondary education covers grades six through eight and secondary education covers grades nine through ten. Higher secondary covers grades eleven and twelve. Students get Secondary Education Examination certificate in grade ten. According to the new Education Act, the national grade 12 Examination will result in the School Leaving Certificate (SLC).\\r\\nIn New Zealand children are required by law to attend 10 years of educational instruction, from the age of 6 to 16. The law also provides in the same legislation that all people are allowed to attend free education to the age of 18, this legislation is the Education Act 1989. Children enroll at primary school when they turn five years old. From years 1ÿ6 students attend primary school. In years 7 and 8 students attend intermediate, or a joint school (years 1ÿ8 or years 7ÿ13). The final years of free education are spent in secondary school (years 9ÿ13). New Zealand also has two older educational stage-numbering systems; standards 5 & 6 were largely unused with the introduction of intermediate schools in the 1950s, while \\"primmer\\" numbering was in use well into the 1970s, and some academically focused secondary schools still use \\"form\\" numbering.\\r\\nPrimary school (sometimes includes up to year 8):\\r\\nIntermediate school:\\r\\nSecondary school:\\r\\nIn Norway children start school at the age of six; before that kindergarten is voluntary. This school is called barneskole (childrenschool):\\r\\nThe second school is ungdomsskole (youth-school). At this level the students are rated with grades in each subject, in addition to behavior and orderliness:\\r\\nThe last school before higher education is called videreg?ende skole (ongoing school) and is voluntary, though most choose to attend. At this level students decide among separate career-related schools. The most popular such school is designed to prepare one for further education,[citation needed] while others prepare students for such as mechanics, electricians, cooks and so on. Educational stages in these schools begin again at \\"one\\" and are named Vg1, Vg2, Vg3 and Vg4. Some of the more practical schools last only two years, and some students may choose to attend an extra year to study higher education. The typical duration is three years, though some schools offer a four-year program to enable students to engage in more athletics or gather real work experience.\\r\\nPreviously in the Philippines, there are only ten years of compulsory education. School starts on the first or second week of June, while school ends in the last week of March or first week of April. There are three stages of education in the Philippines? elementary, junior high school, and senior high school. The original ten years of compulsory education, was raised to twelve years of education. This policy was implemented in June, 2012. Here is the table:\\r\\nIn Russia, compulsory education lasts eight or nine years and begins the year the child turns seven (8 years) or, sometimes, six (9 years). The first stage of elementary school can last either 3 years (so called 1ÿ3 programme for children starting at the age of 7) or 4 years (so called 1ÿ4 programme for children starting at the age of 6). After of the first stage all pupils enter 5th grade, thus pupils that started at the age of 7 do not attend the 4th grade.\\r\\nWhile it is not compulsory to remain in school after graduating from middle school, a student cannot progress to tertiary school without graduating from high school or vocational school.\\r\\nIn Singapore, compulsory education lasts ten years and begins the year the child turns seven. However, most children receive a preschool education spanning two to three years before entering primary school after which they will move on to a secondary school, where Sec 5 is only made compulsory for students who have achieved a determined score for their PSLE.\\r\\nWhile it is not compulsory to remain in school after graduating from secondary school, most go on to receive their tertiary education at a junior college, a polytechnic, or an institute of technical education (ITE) before moving on to university.\\r\\nIn Sweden children start school at the age of seven; before that preschool is voluntary. It is unusual to skip a year of \\"preschool class\\", with most children attending at age six.\\r\\nFirst set of grades are called \\"l?gstadiet\\" (low grades).\\r\\nSecond set of grades are called \\"mellanstadiet\\" (middle grades).\\r\\nThird set of grades are called \\"h?gstadiet\\" (high grades).\\r\\nThe last school before higher education is called \\"gymnasiet\\" (ongoing school) and is voluntary, though most choose to attend. At this level students decide among separate career-related schools. Some of the more practical schools last only two years, and some students may choose to attend an extra year to study higher education. The typical duration is three years, though some schools offer a four-year program to enable students to engage in more athletics or gather real work experience.\\r\\nIn England and Wales education is divided into two stages: primary education and secondary education. Required assessment within the National Curriculum takes place in years 2 and 6 (National Curriculum assessments) and Year 11 (GCSEs). School education is generally followed by two years of further education?ÿ often in a 6th form or 6th form college and then three or four years at university by those who decide to stay in education.\\r\\nChildren begin school either in the school year or school term in which they reach their fifth birthday. Primary schools educate children from Reception through to Year 6, and may be subdivided into infant and junior schools. Alternatively, children may attend private prep schools.\\r\\nSecondary education is compulsory to the age of 16. Schools have various possible names, such as grammar, comprehensive and secondary schools, which may or may not indicate selective admission or tuition fees (see main article). 6th form|6th form education is not compulsory at present, and not all secondary schools have a 6th form. There are also 6th form colleges just for Year 12 and 13 students.\\r\\nSome secondary schools still use the 'form' system, with Year 7 being 1st Form (or \\"1st year\\"), Year 8 being Second Form, et cetera, up until Year 12 and Year 13, which together make up the 6th Form (namely lower and upper sixth form). Some independent schools use other naming systems.\\r\\nIn some areas in England, a three-tier system of education is used, in which students pass through three stages: First school/Lower school (Reception to Year 3/4), Middle school (Year 4/5 to Year 7/8) and finally High or Upper School (Year 8/9ÿYear 13)\\r\\nIn Scotland, education is divided into two stages: primary education and secondary education. Primary education is delivered almost exclusively through primary schools which offer education for pupils aged between 4 and 12. Children are entitled to pre-school education from their third birthday, and must enter compulsory education from the August after their 5th birthday. There is some leeway in the starting date or pupils.[6]\\r\\nEducation lasts 7 years in the primary school, before pupils move to a secondary school for between 4 and 6 years, the last two being optional. There is some variation in the phasing of education in more remote areas of Scotland, where provision may be made in a through school, or in other combinations of institutes.\\r\\nIn the United States (U.S.), the grades traditionally begin at 1 and run to 12; they are referred to by ordinal number (e.g. first grade, or 3rd grade to 12th grade). An additional preceding level called kindergarten (\\"K\\") is now standard in most areas, and a further preceding level called preschool education or nursery school is not uncommon. In some parts of the state of Wisconsin, kindergarten is split further into junior and senior kindergarten.\\r\\nBefore the term \\"middle school\\" became much more commonly applied, grades 7ÿ8 were placed in \\"junior high school\\" (with grade 6 in some schools).\\r\\nAt the secondary school level (\\"high school\\"), grades 9ÿ12 are also known as freshman (or \\"first-year\\"), sophomore, junior, and senior. At the post-secondary level (college or university), these terms are used almost exclusively to refer to what would otherwise be grades 13ÿ16, ending denoted as \\"college senior\\". Then come post-graduate levels.\\r\\nThe Table US (at left) outlines the ages, in years, of each grade level in the US. However, students are sometimes older because of grade retention or younger because of grade skipping.\\r\\nIn some classes, students from various grades might attend together as a multi-grade class, to offer more variety in course subjects, rather than have only a single grade attend those classes.","input":"What are the four stages of high school?"},{"output":"Nonpareils","context":"Nonpareils (or hundreds and thousands outside of North America) are a decorative confectionery of tiny balls made with sugar and starch, traditionally an opaque white but now available in many colors. Their origin is uncertain, but they may have evolved out of the pharmaceutical use of sugar, as they were a miniature version of comfits.[1] The French name has been interpreted to mean they were \\"without equal\\" for intricate decoration of cakes, desserts, and other sweets, and the elaborate pices montes constructed as table ornaments.[2]\\r\\nThe term nonpareil can also refer to a specific confection made using nonpareils, namely, flat discs of chocolate coated with nonpareils, which are also known as chocolate nonpareils.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn 18th-century American recipe for a frosted wedding cake calls for nonpareils as decoration. By the early 19th century, colored nonpareils seem to have been available in the U.S. The popular cookbook author Eliza Leslie suggests the use of red and green nonpareils for decorating a Queen cake, but strongly suggests white nonpareils are most suitable for pink icing on a pound cake in her 1828 Seventy-five Receipts for Pastries, Cakes and Sweetmeats.[3]\\r\\nIn 1844, Eleanor Parkinson, of a well-known Philadelphia family of professional confectioners, first published her book The Complete Confectioner,[4] in which she described how to make nonpareils following her comfit-making procedure, which involved multiple hot pots and hot syrup.\\r\\nG?rlitz, Germany was the birthplace of the German version of nonpareils, popularly known in Germany as liebesperlen (German: love pearls). Invented by confectioner Rudolf Hoinkis (1876ÿ1944), the name derives from a conversation Hoinkis had with his wife, proclaiming his love for her like these \\"pearls,\\" the nonpareil. Unsure of what to call the treat he invented, his wife suggested calling them love pearls, and the name stuck. The factory where he first manufactured the treat, founded in 1896, is now run by his great-grandson, Mathias.[5]\\r\\nIn the United States, traditional nonpareils gave way for most purposes by the mid 20th century to \\"sprinkles\\" (known in some parts as \\"jimmies\\"), confections nearly as small but usually oblong rather than round and soft rather than brittle. Like nonpareils, their function is more decorative than gustatory as their actual taste is indistinct, and the products they are applied to are usually themselves very high in sugar. Candy-covered anise seeds called muisjes, sometimes mistaken for traditional nonpareils, are sometimes offered at breakfast in the Netherlands to be served on bread and butter. They are, however, usually served on rusk to celebrate the birth of a child. This is known as \\"beschuit met muisjes.\\"\\r\\nIn the UK, Australia and New Zealand, nonpareils are known as \\"hundreds-and-thousands.\\" In Australia and New Zealand, they are often eaten on top of patty cakes or on buttered bread as fairy bread, as festive items at children's birthday parties.\\r\\nThe term \\"nonpareils\\" can also refer to a specific confection: a round flat chocolate drop with the upper surface coated with nonpareils.[6] This confection is also referred to as \\"chocolate nonpareils.\\" Nestl makes a variety marketed as Sno-Caps. In Australia, these confections are commonly known as \\"chocolate freckles,\\" or simply \\"freckles.\\" Nonpareils are also sold in the United Kingdom as \\"Jazzles,\\" \\"Jazzies,\\" \\"jazz drops\\" and \\"Snowies\\" (the latter being of the white chocolate variety).","input":"What are hundreds and thousands called in america?"},{"output":"September 22, 1987","context":"Full House is an American sitcom created by Jeff Franklin for ABC. The show chronicles the events of widowed father, Danny Tanner, who enlists his brother-in-law and best friend to help raise his three daughters. It aired from September 22, 1987, to May 23, 1995, broadcasting eight seasons and 192 episodes.\\r\\nWhile never a critical favorite, the series was consistently in the Nielsen Top 30 (from 1988 onward) and gained even more popularity in syndicated reruns.[1] It has also had tie-in merchandise marketed, such as a series of paperback books. A sequel series, Fuller House, premiered on Netflix on February 26, 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter his wife is killed in a car accident, news anchorman Danny Tanner recruits his brother-in-law Jesse Katsopolis (a rock musician) and best friend Joey Gladstone (who works as a stand-up comedian) to help raise his three young daughters: D.J., Stephanie, and Michelle, in his San Francisco home. Over time, the three men as well as the children bond and become closer to one another.\\r\\nIn season two, Danny is reassigned from his duties as sports anchor by his television station to become co-host of a local morning television show, Wake Up, San Francisco, and is teamed up with Nebraska native Rebecca Donaldson. Jesse and Becky eventually fall in love and get married in season four. In season five, Becky gives birth to twin sons, Nicky and Alex.\\r\\nThe producers' first choice to play the character of Danny Tanner was Bob Saget. Saget was not available to appear in the pilot due to his commitment as an on-air contributor to CBS's The Morning Program. The producers instead cast actor John Posey to play Danny. Posey only appeared in the unaired pilot (which is included on the DVD release of Season 1).\\r\\nJohn Stamos's character was originally named Jesse Cochran; Stamos reportedly wanted his character to better reflect his Greek heritage, so producers decided to change the character's surname to Katsopolis (beginning with season two).\\r\\nTo comply with child labor laws, twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were cast to alternate in the role of Michelle during tapings. The girls were jointly credited as \\"Mary Kate Ashley Olsen\\" in seasons two through seven because the producers did not want audiences to know that the Michelle character was played by twins. (In an occasional running gag, both twins would occasionally appear together in fantasy sequences.)\\r\\nAll six of the original cast members remained with the show through its entire eight-year run, with five characters added to the cast along the way. Kimmy Gibbler, a recurring character in seasons one through four, was upgraded to a regular in season five. Rebecca Donaldson (later Katsopolis) originally appeared for six episodes in season two as Danny's co-host on Wake Up, San Francisco; producers decided to expand her role and made her a regular the following season. Nicky and Alex Katsopolis, the twin sons of Jesse and Rebecca, made their debut in season five. As babies, the children were played by Daniel and Kevin Renteria, and in season six, the roles of the twins were succeeded by Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit. The last character added was Steve Hale, who was D.J.'s boyfriend in seasons six and seven. He returned in the second half of the series finale after Kimmy set him up with D.J. to be her date for the senior prom. He was played by Scott Weinger.\\r\\nComet, the family dog, was played by a golden retriever named Buddy. Buddy later appeared in the original Air Bud (1997) before dying of lung cancer at the age of nine.[2]\\r\\nThe series was created by Jeff Franklin and executive produced by Franklin, along with Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett. The series was produced by Jeff Franklin Productions and Miller-Boyett Productions, in association with Lorimar-Telepictures (1987ÿ88), Lorimar Television (1988ÿ93), and then by Warner Bros. Television (1993ÿ95) after Lorimar was folded into Warner Bros.'s existing television production division.\\r\\nAlthough the series was set in San Francisco, the sitcom itself was taped at the Warner Bros. Studios in Los Angeles. Outside of certain excerpts in the opening title sequences, the only episode to have actually been taped in San Francisco was the first episode of season eight, \\"Comet's Excellent Adventure\\". There were also a few episodes which were filmed on-location elsewhere, most notably Hawaii in the season three premiere \\"Tanner's Island\\", and at Walt Disney World for the two-part sixth-season finale \\"The House Meets the Mouse\\".\\r\\nThe series experienced heavy turnover with its writing staff throughout its run, the first season in particular had at least three writing staff changes with Lenny Ripps (who remained with the show until the early part of the fourth season, by then serving as a creative consultant) and Russell Marcus being the only writers surviving the changes through the entire season. Show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin was the only writer to remain with the series throughout its entire eight-season run (Franklin also wrote and directed several episodes during the first five seasons). Marc Warren and Dennis Rinsler joined the series' writing staff in the second season as producers and remained with the show until its 1995 cancellation; Warren and Rinsler took over as head writers by season five and assumed showrunning duties as executive producers for the sixth season to allow Franklin to focus on Hangin' With Mr. Cooper (Full House served as Cooper's lead-in when the former aired on Tuesday nights during the 1992ÿ93 season).\\r\\nThe show's theme song, \\"Everywhere You Look\\", was performed by Jesse Frederick, who co-wrote the song with writing partner Bennett Salvay and series creator Jeff Franklin. Various instrumental versions of the theme song were used in the closing credits; the version used during seasons three through eight was also used in the opening credits in some early syndication runs, although the song was almost always truncated to the chorus for broadcast. Seasons one through five used a longer version of the theme song. In syndicated airings, the line \\"you miss your old familiar friends, but waiting just around the bend\\" replaced the lines starting with \\"how did I get delivered here, somebody tell me please...\\" (after ABC Family acquired the series in 2003, it became the first television outlet to air the long versions of the theme since the series' ABC run, which were included only in select episodes from the first five seasons, whereas the full version was used in most episodes during those seasons).\\r\\n\\r\\nFull House originally aired on Fridays from September 1987 to August 1991, which spanned the show's first four seasons, and later became the flagship program of ABC's newly launched TGIF block in September 1989. The show was briefly moved to Tuesdays during the 1987ÿ88 season and then aired twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays for a few months in order to help the series build an audience. It remained on Fridays permanently for the next three seasons, as the show's ratings increased. Full House was moved to Tuesdays full-time for season five and remained there until the series ended in 1995. While the show's first season was not very successful, mostly because it was a new series placed in an 8 p.m. Eastern timeslot (most freshman series start out in protected time slots preceded by successful lead-ins), the show quickly became popular during its second season as it was placed immediately following the established hit show Perfect Strangers (which was also produced by Tom Miller and Bob Boyett). From season three onwards, it was ranked among Nielsen's Top 30 shows (a ratings increase which allowed the series to move back to Fridays at 8 p.m.).[3] By the fourth season, the series jumped to the Top 20 and remained there until the seventh season (the series peaked at the top ten during seasons five and six).[4]\\r\\nIn 1995, despite the fact the show was still rated in the top 25, ABC announced that it was canceling the show after eight seasons due to the increasing costs of producing the series.[citation needed] The one-hour series finale was watched by 24.3 million viewers, ranking No. 7 for the week and attracting a 14.6 household rating and a 25 percent audience share.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarner Bros. Television Distribution handles the domestic and international syndication rights to the series. During the summer of 1991, reruns of the early seasons began airing in a daily daytime strip on NBC.[7] Starting in September 1991, Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution began distributing Full House for broadcast in off-network syndication and was syndicated on various local stations nationwide until 2003. In 1998, Atlanta-based cable superstation TBS (which became a general entertainment cable channel in October 2007) and Chicago-based superstation WGN (which carried the series locally in the Chicago market via WGN-TV) obtained cable rights to the series and aired the show every weekday until 2002 when it was dropped from the schedules of both networks; the series returned to TBS on December 9, 2013.\\r\\nIn September 2003, ABC Family acquired the series; as a result, ABC Family became the first network since ABC to air the original extended version of the theme song, featured in select episodes of the first five seasons; by the time ABC Family's rights to the series expired in December 2013, the channel ran the closing credits over the last 30 seconds of the final scene, albeit at the bottom of the screen (it was previously played over the channel's genericized credit sequence design). In other broadcast and cable syndication runs (as well as most other episodes aired on ABC Family), a shortened version of the main theme with alternate lyrics is used for all episodes of the first five seasons; however, an altered version of the opening credits for seasons six and seven is used, removing the lyric \\"Whatever happened to predictability; the milkman, the paperboy, evenin' TV\\" that was kept in the long version of the theme during those seasons (the season eight title sequence airs as is).\\r\\nNick at Nite acquired the series in 2003, and aired it from October 6 of that year until April 10, 2009; several months later on August 31, 2009, it moved to sister channel The N and continued to air on that channel after its September 28, 2009, rebrand as TeenNick, where it remained until October 24, 2010. The following day on October 25, the series returned to Nick at Nite after a one-year absence, airing in the hour leading into the start of Nickelodeon's broadcast day. Soon after, though, it was dropped from Nick at Nite again, returning to TeenNick until September 2012, where it was then transferred back to Nick at Nite. When NickSplat lost an hour of broadcast, the series returned to TeenNick again on October 2, 2017. In 2014, episodes have averaged 1.5 million viewers on Nick at Nite, which is up 7 percent from 2013 and a 0.4 rating in the key 18ÿ49 demographic, up 8 percent from 2013.[8]\\r\\nOn September 29, 2017, Hulu acquired the streaming rights to Full House along with fellow Warner Bros. TV productions Family Matters, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Perfect Strangers and Step by Step in addition to fellow ABC programs Boy Meets World, Dinosaurs and Home Improvement.[9]\\r\\nDespite the show's popularity, critical acclaim by viewers, and cult following, critics' reviews for Full House were by most accounts mixed to mediocre,[10] particularly in its early years but became more positive in later years.[11] The first season holds an aggregate score of 31/100 (\\"Generally unfavorable reviews\\") on Metacritic.[12] In Slate, Willa Paskin referred to the series as \\"a hackneyed and saccharine family sitcom\\".[13] Isaac Feldberg opined that it was \\"archetypally average, hiding behind a ubiquitous laugh track and obnoxiously on-the-nose life lessons.\\"[14]\\r\\nDuring Bob Saget's final season as host of America's Funniest Home Videos, six other Full House cast alumni (John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Candace Cameron, Jodie Sweetin, Andrea Barber, and Lori Loughlin) reunited on the May 9, 1997, episode (the episode which preceded Saget's final episode as host of that series).[15]\\r\\nIn a December 2008 news story,[16] it was reported that John Stamos was planning a reunion movie.[17] This idea was quickly withdrawn, because reportedly most of the cast was not interested.[18] In 2009, Stamos announced that a feature film based on the show was still planned. Stamos told The New York Daily News, \\"I'm working on a movie idea, but it wouldn't be us playing us. I'm not 100% sure, but it would probably take place in the first few years.\\" Stamos posited Steve Carell and Tracy Morgan for the roles of Danny and Joey respectively.[19]\\r\\nIn 2012, eight of the Full House cast members reunited in Los Angeles for their 25th anniversary. Publicists for Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen said that they \\"weren't able to attend, given their work schedules.\\"[20]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2013, the original Jesse and the Rippers (the band which Jesse Katsopolis served as frontman, until he was voted out in season 8) reunited on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. The group performed a medley of covers including the Beach Boys' \\"Forever,\\" Elvis Presley's \\"Little Sister,\\" \\"Hippy Hippy Shake\\", and ending with the Full House theme \\"Everywhere You Look\\". Bob Saget and Lori Loughlin made cameo appearances.[21]\\r\\nIn January 2014, Saget, Stamos, and Coulier appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. They each reprised their characters, while Fallon dressed in child's pajamas in a bed framed by four gigantic pencils, similar to Michelle Tanner's bed from the show. Saget, Stamos, and Coulier said some of their famous catchphrases from the show, as well as singing \\"The Teddy Bear\\" song.[22] Stamos, Saget and Coulier also appeared together in a 2014 commercial for Dannon Oikos Greek Yogurt (for which Stamos serves as spokesperson) that debuted during Super Bowl XLVIII, days after their appearance on Late Night.[23]\\r\\nIn August 2014, reports circulated that Warner Bros. Television was considering a series spin-off.[24] John Stamos, who has an ownership stake in the show, headed up the attempt to get the series back into production.[25] Netflix closed a deal to produce a 13-episode sequel series tentatively titled Fuller House, with many of the original series cast members reprising their roles.[26] Notably, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen both declined to reprise the role of Michelle in the first season,[27] although the creators and producers said they could still possibly appear in future seasons.[28][29] Stamos would guest star as well and serve as producer.[30][31]\\r\\nFilming began on July 25, 2015.[32] Like the original series, the show is set in San Francisco.[33] The original series idea was focused on D.J., a veterinarian struggling to raise three boys after her firefighter husband, Tommy Fuller is killed in the line of duty; Stephanie, who is aspiring to become a musician; and Kimmy, who is a party planner and a single mother to a teenage daughter, Ramona. The show's premise follows one similar to the original series when Stephanie makes plans to put her career on hold for a while and move in with D.J. to help take care of her children. Almost immediately afterwards, Kimmy makes the same offer for her and Ramona to move in and help out. Netflix premiered the series on February 26, 2016,[34] with the premiere episode featuring a Tanner family reunion.[35][36] As of September 22, 2017 there have been three seasons of the series.[37]\\r\\nWarner Home Video released all eight seasons of the series on DVD in Region 1 between 2005 and 2007.[38] A complete series box-set containing all 192 episodes was released on November 6, 2007. As of 2016, the complete series is available for purchase via online retailers such as Amazon.[39] Additionally, the first four seasons were also released on DVD in Region 2 and Region 4.[40]\\r\\nBooks based on Full House are geared toward children primarily between the ages of 8 and 14. Warner Bros., which holds the rights to Full House and its associated characters, would not permit others to use their characters, and selected who could write books based on the television series. The books are based on the Silhouette romance novels by Mills & Boon. Full House Michelle #7: Summer Rhapsody is a Silhouette Special Edition #75 by Nancy John and Laura O'Neil in February 1983.\\r\\nThe series includes the following:\\r\\nIn 2006, Full House was one of a group of Warner Brothers properties licensed to Moscow-based network STS for adaptation to Russian. The show, Topsy-Turvy House (ru: ־ְѿ) followed the plots of the American version with changes to accommodate cultural differences. It ran for two seasons, beginning in 2009.[41][42]\\r\\nOn August 22, 2015, a television movie called The Unauthorized Full House Story was first released by Lifetime. It tells the behind-the-scenes story of the series.[43]\\r\\nT G I f","input":"When did the first episode of full house air?"},{"output":"54,555 square miles","context":"","input":"What is the size of new york state?"},{"output":"Protestantism","context":"Religion in South Korea (2015)[1]\\r\\n(Note: Percentages are rounded.)\\r\\nReligion in South Korea is characterised by the fact that a majority of South Koreans (56.1% as of the 2015 national census) have no formal affiliation with a religion. Among those who are members of a religious organisation, there is a dominance of Protestantism (19.7%), Buddhism (15.5%), and Catholicism (7.9%), percentages of the total population. A small percentage of South Koreans (0.8% in total) are members of other religions, including Won Buddhism, Confucianism, Cheondoism, Daesun Jinrihoe, Daejongism, and Jeungsanism.[1]\\r\\nBuddhism was influential in ancient times and Christianity persuaded large segments of the population already in the 18th and 19th century, yet they grew rapidly in membership only by the mid-20th century, as part of the profound transformations that South Korean society went through in the past century,[2] and then have shown some decline from the 2000s onwards. Native shamanic religions (i.e. Sindo) remain popular and could represent a large part of the unaffiliated. Indeed, according to a 2012 survey, only 15% of the population declared to be not religious in the sense of \\"atheism\\".[3] According to the 2015 census, the proportion of the unaffiliated is higher among the youth, about 65% among the 20-years old.[4]\\r\\nKorea entered the 20th century with an already ingrained Christian presence and a vast majority of the population practicing native religion (Sindo). The latter never gained the high status of a national religious culture comparable to China's system and Japan's Shinto; this weakness of Korean Sindo was among the reasons that left a free hand to an early and thorough rooting of Christianity.[5] The population also took part in Confucianising rites and held private ancestor worship.[2] Organised religions and philosophies belonged to the ruling elites, and the long patronage exerted by the Chinese empire led these elites to embrace a particularly strict Confucianism (i.e. Korean Confucianism). Korean Buddhism, despite an erstwhile rich tradition, at the dawn of the 20th century was virtually extinct as a religious institution, after 500 years of suppression under the Joseon kingdom.[2][6] Christianity had antecedents in the Korean peninsula as early as the 18th century, when the philosophical school of Seohak supported the religion. With the fall of the Joseon in the last decades of the 19th century, Koreans largely embraced Christianity, since the monarchy itself and the intellectuals looked to Western models to modernise the country and endorsed the work of Catholic and Protestant missionaries.[7] During Japanese colonisation in the first half of the 20th century, the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism was further strengthened,[8] as the Japanese tried to merge native Sindo with their State Shinto.\\r\\nWith the division of Korea into two states after 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south, the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,[9] fled to South Korea.[10] It has been estimated that Christians who migrated to the south were more than one million.[11] Throughout the second half of the 20th century, the South Korean state enacted measures to further marginalise indigenous Sindo, at the same time strengthening Christianity and a revival of Buddhism.[12] According to scholars, South Korean censuses do not count believers in indigenous Sindo and underestimate the number of adherents of Sindo sects.[13] Otherwise, statistics compiled by the ARDA[14] estimate that as of 2010, 14.7% of South Koreans practice ethnic religion, 14.2% adhere to new movements, and 10.9% practice Confucianism.[15]\\r\\nAccording to some observers, the sharp decline of some religions (Catholicism and Buddhism) recorded between the censuses of 2005 and 2015 is due to the change in survey methodology between the two censuses. While the 2005 census was an analysis of the entire population (\\"whole survey\\") through traditional data sheets compiled by every family, the 2015 census was largely conducted through the internet and was limited to a sample of about 20% of the South Korean population. It has been argued that the 2015 census penalised the rural population, which is more Buddhist and Catholic and less familiar with the internet, while advantaging the Protestant population, which is more urban and has easier access to the internet. Both the Buddhist and the Catholic communities criticised the 2015 census' results.[4] Furthermore, according to another analysis it is possible that many Catholics registered as Protestants in the 2015 census due to an unclear differentiation between Catholicism and Protestantism (which in Korean is commonly called simply \\"Christianity\\") in the census form.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the introduction of Buddhism, all Koreans believed in their indigenous religion socially guided by mu (shamans). Buddhism was introduced from the Chinese Former Qin state in 372 to the northern Korean state of Goguryeo and developed into distinctive Korean forms. At that time, the peninsula was divided into three kingdoms: the aforementioned Goguryeo in the north, Baekje in the southwest, and Silla in the southeast. Buddhism reached Silla only in the 5th century, but it was made the state religion only in that kingdom in the year 552.[21] Buddhism became much more popular in Silla and even in Baekje (both areas now part of modern South Korea), while in Goguryeo the Korean indigenous religion remained dominant. In the following unified state of Goryeo (918ÿ1392) Buddhism flourished, and even became a political force.[22]\\r\\nThe Joseon kingdom (1392ÿ1910), adopted an especially strict version of Neo-Confucianism (i.e. Korean Confucianism) and suppressed and marginalised Korean Buddhism[23][24] and Korean shamanism.[6] Buddhist monasteries were destroyed, and their number dropped from several hundreds to a mere thirty-six; Buddhism was eradicated from the life of towns as monks and nuns were prohibited from entering them and were marginalised to the mountains.[24] These restrictions lasted until the 19th century.[25]\\r\\nIn the late 19th century, the Joseon state was politically and culturally collapsing.[26] Interested parties were looking for solutions to invigorate and transform the nation.[26] It was in this critical period that they came into contact with Western Protestant missionaries who offered a proven way to use religious beliefs and their system of fears for shaping a citizenship that is obedient to religious and other leaderships.[26] Christian communities already existed in Joseon since the 17th century, however it was only by the 1880s that the government allowed a large number of Western missionaries to enter the country.[27] Protestant missionaries set up schools, hospitals and publishing agencies.[28] The royal family supported Christianity.[29]\\r\\nDuring the absorption of Korea into the Japanese Empire (1910ÿ1945) the already formed link of Christianity with Korean nationalism was strengthened,[8] as the Japanese tried to impose State Shinto, co-opting within it native Korean Sindo, and Christians refused to take part in Shinto rituals.[8] At the same time, numerous religious movements that since the 19th century had been trying to reform the Korean indigenous religion, notably Cheondoism, flourished.[30]\\r\\nWith the division of Korea into two states in 1945, the communist north and the anti-communist south, the majority of the Korean Christian population that had been until then in the northern half of the peninsula,[9] fled to South Korea.[10] Christians who resettled in the south were more than one million. Cheondoists, who were concentrated in the north like Christians, remained there after the partition,[30] and South Korea now has no more than few thousands Cheondoists.\\r\\nThe so-called \\"movement to defeat the worship of gods\\" promoted by governments of South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, prohibited indigenous cults and wiped out nearly all traditional shrines (sadang ??) of the Confucian kinship religion.[31] This was particularly tough under the rule of Park Chung-hee (a Buddhist).[32]\\r\\nThis measure, combined with the rapid social changes of the same period,[2] favoured a rapid revival of Korean Buddhism and growth of Christian churches in a trend to register as members of organised religions.[33] The number of Buddhist temples rose from 2,306 in 1962 to 11,561 in 1997, Protestant churches rose from 6,785 in 1962 to 58,046 in 1997, the Catholic Church had 313 churches in 1965 and 1,366 in 2005, Won Buddhism had 131 temples in 1969 and 418 in 1997.[34] Similarly, Daesun Jinrihoe's temples have grown from 700 in 1983 to 1,600 in 1994.[35] Statistics from censuses show that the proportion of the South Korean population self-identifying as Buddhist has grown from 2.6% in 1962 to 22.8% in 2005,[2] while the proportion of Christians has grown from 5% in 1962 to 29.2% in 2005.[2] However, both religions have shown a decline between the years 2005 and 2015, with Buddhism sharply declining in influence to 15.5% of the population, and a less significant decline of Christianity to 27.6%.[36]\\r\\nSince the 1980s and the 1990s there have been acts of hostility committed by Protestants against Buddhists and followers of traditional religions in South Korea. This include the arson of temples, the beheading of statues of Buddha and bodhisattvas, and red Christian crosses painted on either statues or other Buddhist and other religions' properties.[37] Some of these acts have even been promoted by churches' pastors.[37]\\r\\nIn 2018, a mass protest broke out in support of freedom of religion and against the government's inaction on widespread programs of violent forced conversion carried out by Christian churches under the guide of the Christian Council of Korea (CCK), just after a woman named Ji-In Gu, one among approximately a thousand victims of the churches, was kidnapped and killed while being forced to convert. Before being killed, Ji-In Gu dedicated herself in exposing the conversion treatments, and for such reason she had become a target of the Christian churches.[38][39]\\r\\nChristianity (????? Geurisdogyo or ??? Gidoggyo) in South Korea is predominantly Protestant (??? Gaesingyo, \\"renewed teaching\\") and Catholic (??? Cheonjugyo, \\"religion of the Lord of Heaven\\", or ??? ?? Gatollig gyohoe), respectively with 9.6 million and 3.8 million members as of the 2015 census. There are also small communities of Orthodox Christians (??? Jeonggyohoe) under the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and Mormons (???? Molmongyo).\\r\\nForeign Roman Catholic missionaries did not arrive in Korea until 1794, a decade after the return of Yi Sung-hun, a diplomat who was the first baptised Korean in Beijing.[40] He established a grass roots lay Catholic movement in Korea. However, the writings of the Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci, who was resident at the imperial court in Beijing, had been already brought to Korea from China in the 17th century. Scholars of the Silhak (\\"Practical Learning\\") were attracted to Catholic doctrines, and this was a key factor for the spread of the Catholic faith in the 1790s.[41] The penetration of Western ideas and Christianity in Korea became known as Seohak (\\"Western Learning\\"). A study of 1801 found that more than half of the families that had converted to Catholicism were linked to the Seohak school.[42] Largely because converts refused to perform Confucian ancestral rituals, the Joseon government prohibited Christian proselytising. Some Catholics were executed during the early 19th century, but the restrictive law was not strictly enforced.\\r\\nProtestant missionaries entered Korea during the 1880s and, along with Catholic priests, converted a remarkable number of Koreans, this time with the support of the royal government which winked at Westernising forces in a period of deep internal crisis (due to the waning of centuries-long patronage from a then-weakened China).[29] The lack of a national religious system compared to those of China and that of Japan (Korean Sindo never developed to a high status of institutional and civic religion) gave a free hand to Christian churches.[5] Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries were especially successful. They established schools, universities, hospitals, and orphanages and played a significant role in the modernisation of the country.[28] During the Japanese colonial occupation, Christians were in the front ranks of the struggle for independence. Factors contributing to the growth of Protestantism included the decayed state of Korean Buddhism, the support of the intellectual elite, and the encouragement of self-support and self-government among members of the Korean church, and finally the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism.[29]\\r\\nA large number of Christians lived in the northern part of the peninsula (it was part of the so-called \\"Manchurian revival\\")[29] where Confucian influence was not as strong as in the south.[9] Before 1948 Pyongyang was an important Christian centre: one-sixth of its population of about 300,000 people were converts. Following the establishment of the communist regime in the north, an estimated more than one million Korean Christians resettled to South Korea to escape persecution by North Korea's anti-Christian policies.[10]\\r\\nChristianity grew significantly in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s it continued to grow, but at a slower rate, and since the 2000s it has shown some decline. Christianity is especially dominant in the west of the country including Seoul, Incheon, and the regions of Gyeonggi and Honam. The Christian faith in South Korea is dominated by four denominations: Presbyterianism (??? pronounced Jangnogyo), Methodism (??? pronounced Gamnigyo), Baptists (??? pronounced Chimnyegyo) and Catholicism. The Yoido Full Gospel Church is the largest Pentecostal church in the country. Some non-denominational churches also exist. Korean Catholics still observe jesa (ancestral rites); the Korean tradition is very different from the institutional religious ancestral worship that is found in China and Japan and can be easily integrated as ancillary to Christianity. Protestants, by contrast, have completely abandoned the practice.[43]\\r\\nThe peace churches have not gained a strong foothold on the peninsula. Quaker thought briefly attracted a national following in the late 20th century, thanks to the leadership of Ham Seok-heon. However, after Ham's death, interest in Quakerism declined. The state of Unitarianism is similar.\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Korea was established following the baptism of Kim Ho Jik in 1951. Studying nutrition in Cornell, he met a member of their faith, Oliver Wyman, and was struck with their doctrine. Upon joining the church and completing his degree, Kim travelled back to South Korea, started translations for materials, and helped the church gain official recognition.[44]\\r\\nAs of 2012 there were 81,628 Mormons and one temple in Seoul,[45] four missions (Seoul, Daejeon, Busan, and Seoul South),[46] 128 congregations, and twenty-four family history centres.[47]\\r\\nBuddhism (?? Bulgyo) entered Korea from China during the period of the three kingdoms (372, or the 4th century).[21] Buddhism was the dominant religious and cultural influence in the Silla (668-935) and subsequent Goryeo (918-1392) states. Confucianism was also brought to Korea from China in early centuries, and was formulated as Korean Confucianism in Goryeo. However, it was only in the subsequent Joseon kingdom (1392ÿ1910) that Korean Confucianism was established as the state ideology and religion, and Korean Buddhism underwent 500 years of suppression.[23][24] Buddhism in the contemporary state of South Korea is stronger in the east of the country, namely the Yeongnam and Gangwon regions, as well as in Jeju.\\r\\nThere are a number of different schools in Korean Buddhism (???? Daehanbulgyo), including the Seon (Korean Zen). The overwhelming majority of Buddhist temples in contemporary South Korea belong to the dominant Jogye Order, traditionally related to the Seon school. The order's headquarters are at Jogyesa in central Seoul, and it operates most of the country's old and famous temples, such as Bulguksa and Beomeosa.\\r\\nOther Buddhist traditions in South Korea include the \\"Taego\\" and \\"Cheontae\\" lineages. Taego is a form of Seon (Zen), while the Choentae is a modern revival of the Tiantai lineage in Korea, focusing on the Lotus Sutra. Another lineage, the Jingak Order, is a form of Vajrayana Buddhism. Both the Jogye and Cheontae orders require their monastics to be celibate, while the Taego and Jingak orders allow for married priests.\\r\\nWon Buddhism (??? Wonbulgyo) is a modern reformed Buddhism that seeks to make enlightenment possible for everyone and applicable to regular life. The scriptures and practices are simplified so that anyone, regardless of their wealth, occupation, or other external living conditions, can understand them.[50]\\r\\nKorean shamanism, also known as \\"Muism\\" (?? Mugyo, \\"mu [shaman] religion\\")[51] and \\"Sindo\\" (??) or \\"Sinism\\" (?? Singyo \\"Way of the Gods\\").[52][53] is the native religion of the Koreans.[54][note 1] Although used synonymously, the two terms aren't identical:[54] Jung Young Lee describes Muism as a form of Sindo - the shamanic tradition within the religion.[55] Particularly akin to Japan's Shinto, contrarywise to it ad to China's religious systems, Korean Sindo never developed into a national religious culture.[5][clarification needed]\\r\\nIn contemporary Korean language the shaman-priest or mu (hanja: ) is known as a mudang (Hangul: ?? hanja: ) if female or baksu if male, although other names and locutions are used.[54][note 2] Korean mu \\"shaman\\" is synonymous with Chinese wu, which defines priests both male and female.[55] The role of the mudang is to act as intermediary between the spirits or gods, and the human plain, through gut (rituals), seeking to resolve problems in the patterns of development of human life.[57]\\r\\nCentral is interaction with Haneullim or Hwanin, meaning \\"source of all being\\",[58] and of all gods of nature,[55] the utmost god or the supreme mind.[59] The mu are mythically described as descendants of the \\"Heavenly King\\", son of the \\"Holy Mother [of the Heavenly King]\\", with investiture often passed down through female princely lineage.[60] However, other myths link the heritage of the traditional faith to Dangun, male son of the Heavenly King and initiator of the Korean nation.[61]\\r\\nBesides Japanese Shinto, Korean religion has also similarities with Chinese Wuism,[62] and is akin to the Siberian, Mongolian, and Manchurian religious traditions.[62] Some studies trace the Korean ancestral god Dangun to the Ural-Altaic Tengri \\"Heaven\\", the shaman and the prince.[63][64] In the dialects of some provinces of Korea the shaman is called dangul dangul-ari.[58] The mudang is similar to the Japanese miko and the Ryukyuan yuta. Muism has exerted an influence on some Korean new religions, such as Cheondoism and Jeungsanism. According to various sociological studies, Korea's type of Christianity owes much of its success to native shamanism, which provided a congenial mindset and models for the religion to take root.[65]\\r\\nIn the 1890s, the last decades of the Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of native religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults.[66] The Protestant discourse would have had an influence on all further attempts to uproot native religion.[66] The \\"movement to destroy Sindo\\" carried out in South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, destroyed much of the physical heritage of Korean religion (temples and shrines),[31] especially during the regime of President Park Chung-hee.[32][67][68] There has been of a revival of shamanism in South Korea in most recent times.[69][70]\\r\\nCheondoism (??? Cheondogyo) is a fundamentally Confucian religious tradition derived from indigenous Sinism. It is the religious dimension of the Donghak (\\"Eastern Learning\\") movement that was founded by Choe Je-u (1824-1864), a member of an impoverished yangban (aristocratic) family,[71] in 1860 as a counter-force to the rise of \\"foreign religions\\",[72] which in his view included Buddhism and Christianity (part of Seohak, the wave of Western influence that penetrated Korean life at the end of the 19th century).[72] Choe Je-u founded Cheondoism after having been allegedly healed from illness by an experience of Sangje or Haneullim, the god of the universal Heaven in traditional shamanism.[72]\\r\\nThe Donghak movement became so influential among common people that in 1864 the Joseon government sentenced Choe Je-u to death.[72] The movement grew and in 1894 the members gave rise to the Donghak Peasant Revolution against the royal government. With the division of Korea in 1945, most of the Cheondoist community remained in the north, where the majority of them dwelled.[30] Only few thousands of them remain in South Korea today.\\r\\nThe social and historical significance of the Donghak movement and Cheondoism has been largely ignored in South Korea,[73] contrarywise to North Korea where Cheondoism is viewed positively as a folk (minjung) movement.[73]\\r\\nApart from Cheondoism, other sects based on indigenous religion were founded between the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century. They include Daejongism (??? Daejonggyo),[74] which has as its central creed the worship of Dangun, legendary founder of Gojoseon, thought of as the first proto-Korean kingdom; and a splinter sect of Cheondoism: Suwunism.[citation needed]\\r\\nJeungsanism (??? Jeungsangyo) defines a family of religions founded in the early 20th century[75] that emphasise magical practices and millenarian teachings. Part of it are more than a hundred \\"Jeungsan religions,\\" including the now defunct Bocheonism: the largest in Korea is currently Daesun Jinrihoe (?????), an offshoot of the still existing Taegeukdo (???), while Jeungsando (???) is the most active overseas[76]. They show themes derived from Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Korean folk religion.[77]\\r\\nThere are also a number of small religious sects, which have sprung up around Gyeryongsan (\\"Rooster-Dragon Mountain\\", always one of Korea's most-sacred areas) in South Chungcheong Province, the supposed future site of the founding of a new dynasty originally prophesied in the 18th century (or before). Japanese Tenriism (??? Cheonligyo) also claims to have thousands of South Korean members.[78]\\r\\nAccording to Andrew Eungi Kim, there was a rise of new religious movements in the late 1900s which account for about 10 percent of all churches in South Korea. According to Kim, this is the outcome of foreign invasions, as well as conflicting views regarding social and political issues. Many of the new religious movements are syncretic in character.[79]\\r\\nThe Unification Church or Unificationism (??? Tongilgyo)[80] is a new religious movement founded in South Korea in 1954 by Sun Myung Moon. Since its founding, the church has expanded throughout the world with most members living in East Asia.\\r\\nUnificationist beliefs are derived from the Christian Bible and are explained in the church's textbook, the Divine Principle. It teaches that God is the creator and Heavenly Father, whose dual nature combines both masculinity and femininity and whose centre is true love.\\r\\nThe Unification Church has sponsored many organizations and projects over the years; including businesses, news media, projects in education and the arts, and political and social activism. The church was led by Moon until his death on September 3, 2012. At the time of Moon's death, it was reported that his widow Hak Ja Han would assume the leadership of the church. Their philosophy for establishing the Kingdom of Heaven is family centred.[81]\\r\\nIn 2003, Korean Unification Church members started a political party in South Korea. It was named \\"The Party for God, Peace, Unification, and Home\\". In an inauguration declaration, the new party said it would focus on preparing for the reunification of the South and North Korea by educating the public about God and peace. A church official said that similar political parties would be started in Japan and the United States.[82]\\r\\nOther Korean new religions that originated within Christianity are the World Mission Society Church of God and the Victory Altar.\\r\\nOnly few contemporary South Koreans identify as adherents of Confucianism (?? Yugyo). Korean intellectuals historically developed a distinct Korean Confucianism. However, with the end of the Joseon state and the wane of Chinese influence in the 19th and 20th century, Confucianism was abandoned. The influence of Confucian ethical thought remains strong in other religious practices, and in Korean culture in general. Confucian rituals are still practised at various times of the year. The most prominent of these are the annual rites held at the Shrine of Confucius in Seoul. Other rites, for instance those in honour of clan founders, are held at shrines found throughout the country.\\r\\nHinduism (??? Hindugyo) is practiced among South Korea's small Indian and Nepali immigrant community. However, Hindu traditions such as yoga and Vedanta have attracted interest among younger South Koreans. There are two Hindu temples in the Seoul region, the Sri Radha Shyamasundar Mandir and the Sri Sri Radha Krishna temple, located on Seoul's outskirts.\\r\\nIslam (???? Iseullamgyo) in South Korea is represented by a community of roughly 40,000 Muslims, mainly composed by people who converted during the Korean War and their descendants and not including migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia. The largest mosque is the Seoul Central Mosque in the Itaewon district of Seoul; smaller mosques can be found in most of the country's major cities.\\r\\nIn addition to native Korean Muslims, there are around a hundred thousand foreign workers from Muslim countries, particularly Pakistanis and Bangladeshis.[83]\\r\\nThe Jewish existence in South Korea effectively began with the dawn of the Korean War in 1950. At this time a large number of Jewish soldiers, including the chaplain Chaim Potok, came to the Korean peninsula. Today the Jewish community is very small and limited to the Seoul Capital Area. There have been very few Korean converts to Judaism (??? Yutaegyo).\\r\\nDuring Japan's colonisation of Korea (1910-1945), given the common Altaic origins of the two peoples, Koreans were considered to be outright part of the Japanese population, to be wholly assimilated. The Japanese studied and coopted native Sindo by overlapping it with their State Shinto (similar measures of assimilation were applied to Buddhism), which hinged upon the worship of Japanese high gods and the emperor's godhead. Hundreds of Japanese Shinto shrines were built throughout the peninsula.[84]\\r\\nThis policy led to massive conversion of Koreans to Christian churches, which were already well ingrained in the country, representing a concern for the Japanese program, and supported Koreans' independence.[85]","input":"What is the most practiced religion in south korea?"},{"output":"bacterial","context":"Bubonic plague is one of three types of bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis.[1] One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu like symptoms develop.[1] These include fever, headaches, and vomiting.[1] Swollen and painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin.[2] Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.[1]\\r\\nThe three types of plague are the result of the route of infection: bubonic plague, septicemic plague, and pneumonic plague.[1] Bubonic plague is mainly spread by infected fleas from small animals.[1] It may also result from exposure to the body fluids from a dead plague infected animal.[5] In the bubonic form of plague, the bacteria enter through the skin through a flea bite and travel via the lymphatic vessels to a lymph node, causing it to swell.[1] Diagnosis is made by finding the bacteria in the blood, sputum, or fluid from lymph nodes.[1]\\r\\nPrevention is through public health measures such as not handling dead animals in areas where plague is common.[1] Vaccines have not been found to be very useful for plague prevention.[1] Several antibiotics are effective for treatment including streptomycin, gentamicin, and doxycycline.[3][4] Without treatment it results in the death of 30% to 90% of those infected.[1][3] Death, if it occurs, is typically within ten days.[6] With treatment the risk of death is around 10%.[3] Globally there are about 650 documented cases a year which result in ~120 deaths.[1] The disease is most common in Africa.[1]\\r\\nThe plague is believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Asia, Europe, and Africa in the 14th century and killed an estimated 50 million people.[1] This was about 25% to 60% of the European population.[1][7] Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose due to the demand for labor.[7] Some historians see this as a turning point in European economic development.[7] The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word ?, meaning \\"groin\\".[8] The term \\"buboes\\" is also used to refer to the swollen lymph nodes.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best-known symptom of bubonic plague is one or more infected, enlarged, and painful lymph nodes, known as buboes. After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea, the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce. Buboes associated with the bubonic plague are commonly found in the armpits, upper femoral, groin and neck region. Acral gangrene (i.e., of the fingers, toes, lips and nose) is another common symptom.\\r\\nBecause of its bite-based mode of transmission, the bubonic plague is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium. Symptoms include:\\r\\nOther symptoms include heavy breathing, continuous vomiting of blood (hematemesis), aching limbs, coughing, and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive. Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, lenticulae (black dots scattered throughout the body), delirium, and coma.\\r\\nBubonic plague is an infection of the lymphatic system, usually resulting from the bite of an infected flea, Xenopsylla cheopis (the rat flea). In very rare circumstances, as in the septicemic plague, the disease can be transmitted by direct contact with infected tissue or exposure to the cough of another human. The flea is parasitic on house and field rats, and seeks out other prey when its rodent hosts die. The bacteria remained harmless to the flea, allowing the new host to spread the bacteria. The bacteria form aggregates in the gut of infected fleas and this results in the flea regurgitating ingested blood, which is now infected, into the bite site of a rodent or human host. Once established, bacteria rapidly spread to the lymph nodes and multiply.\\r\\nY. pestis bacilli can resist phagocytosis and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, the lymph nodes can haemorrhage and become swollen and necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.\\r\\nLaboratory testing is required in order to diagnose and confirm plague. Ideally, confirmation is through the identification of Y. pestis culture from a patient sample. Confirmation of infection can be done by examining serum taken during the early and late stages of infection. To quickly screen for the Y. pestis antigen in patients, rapid dipstick tests have been developed for field use.[12]\\r\\nSeveral classes of antibiotics are effective in treating bubonic plague. These include aminoglycosides such as streptomycin and gentamicin, tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), and the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. Mortality associated with treated cases of bubonic plague is about 1ÿ15%, compared to a mortality of 40ÿ60% in untreated cases.[13]\\r\\nPeople potentially infected with the plague need immediate treatment and should be given antibiotics within 24 hours of the first symptoms to prevent death. Other treatments include oxygen, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support. People who have had contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague are given prophylactic antibiotics.[14] Using the broad-based antibiotic streptomycin has proven to be dramatically successful against the bubonic plague within 12 hours of infection.[15]\\r\\nThe first recorded epidemic affected the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) and was named the Plague of Justinian after emperor Justinian I, who was infected but survived through extensive treatment.[16] [17] The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million (6th century outbreak) to 50 million people (two centuries of recurrence).[18][19] The historian Procopius wrote, in Volume II of History of the Wars, of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire. In the spring of 542, the plague arrived in Constantinople, working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea, later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy. Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinians efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies, his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague. Procopius, in his work Secret History, declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness.[19]\\r\\nIn the Late Middle Ages (1340ÿ1400) Europe experienced the most deadly disease outbreak in history when the Black Death, the infamous pandemic of bubonic plague, hit in 1347, killing a third of the human population.[where?] Some historians believe that society subsequently became more violent as the mass mortality rate cheapened life and thus increased warfare, crime, popular revolt, waves of flagellants, and persecution.[20] The Black Death originated in or near China and spread from Italy and then throughout other European countries. Arab historians Ibn Al-Wardni and Almaqrizi believed the Black Death originated in Mongolia. Chinese records also showed a huge outbreak in Mongolia in the early 1330s.[21] Research published in 2002 suggests that it began in early 1346 in the steppe region, where a plague reservoir stretches from the northwestern shore of the Caspian Sea into southern Russia. The Mongols had cut off the trade route, the Silk Road, between China and Europe which halted the spread of the Black Death from eastern Russia to Western Europe. The epidemic began with an attack that Mongols launched on the Italian merchants' last trading station in the region, Caffa in the Crimea.[15] In late 1346, plague broke out among the besiegers and from them penetrated into the town. When spring arrived, the Italian merchants fled on their ships, unknowingly carrying the Black Death. Carried by the fleas on rats, the plague initially spread to humans near the Black Sea and then outwards to the rest of Europe as a result of people fleeing from one area to another.\\r\\nThere were many ethno-medical beliefs for avoiding the Black Death. One of the most famous was that by walking around with flowers in or around their nose people would be able to \\"ward off the stench and perhaps the evil that afflicted them\\". People believed the plague to be a punishment from God, and that the only way to be rid of the plague was to be forgiven by God.[22] One such method used was to carve the symbol of the cross onto the front door of a house with the words \\"Lord have mercy on us\\".[23]\\r\\nPistoia, a city in Italy, went as far as enacting rules and regulations on the city and its inhabitants to keep it safe from the Black Death. The rules stated that no one was allowed to visit any plague-infected area and if they did they were not allowed back into the city. Some other rules were that no linen or woollen goods were to be imported into the city and no corpses were to be buried in the city. Despite strict enforcement of the rules, the city eventually became infected.[24] People who were not infected with the plague gathered in groups and stayed away from the sick. They ate and drank with limited food and water and were not even allowed oral communication because it was believed that merely talking with one another increased the chance of passing on the disease.[25]\\r\\nWhile Europe was devastated by the disease, the rest of the world fared much better. In India, population rose from a population of 91 million in 1300, to 97 million in 1400, to 105 million in 1500. Sub-Saharan Africa remained largely unaffected by the plagues.[26]\\r\\nThe next few centuries were marked by several localized or regional outbreaks of lesser severity. The Great Plague of Milan (1629ÿ1631), the Great Plague of Seville (1647), the Great Plague of London (1665ÿ1666), the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), Great Baltic plague (1708ÿ1712), the Great Plague of Marseille (1720), the Great Plague of 1738, and Caragea's Plague (1813ÿ1814) were the last major outbreaks of the bubonic plague in Europe.\\r\\nMedieval doctors thought the plague was created by air corrupted by humid weather, decaying unburied bodies, and fumes produced by poor sanitation. The recommended treatment of the plague was a good diet, rest, and relocating to a non-infected environment so the individual could get access to clean air. This did help, but not for the reasons the doctors of the time thought. In actuality, because they recommended moving away from unsanitary conditions, people were, in effect, getting away from the rodents that harbored the fleas carrying the infection. However, this also helped to spread the infection to new areas previously non-infected.\\r\\nThe plague resurfaced for a third time in the mid-19th century. Like the two previous outbreaks, this one also originated in Eastern Asia.[27] The initial outbreak occurred in China's Yunnan province in 1855.[28] The disease remained localized in Southwest China for several years before spreading. In the city of Canton, beginning in January 1894, the disease killed 80,000 people by June. Daily water-traffic with the nearby city of Hong Kong rapidly spread the plague there, killing over 2,400 within two months.[29]\\r\\nFrom China, the plague spread to the Indian subcontinent around 1896. Over the next thirty years, India would lose 12.5 million people to the bubonic plague. The disease was initially seen in port cities, beginning with Bombay (now Mumbai), but later emerged in Poona (now Pune), Kolkata, and Karachi (now in Pakistan). By 1899, the outbreak spread to smaller communities and rural areas in many regions of India. Overall, the impact of plague epidemics was greatest in western and northern Indiain the provinces then designated as Bombay, Punjab, and the United Provinceswhile eastern and southern India were not as badly affected. Ultimately, more than 12 million people died from the plague in India (including present day Pakistan and Bangladesh) and China alone.\\r\\nIn 1899, the plague reached the islands of Hawaii.[30] The first evidence of the disease was found in Honolulu's Chinatown on Oahu.[31] It was located very close to the island's piers, and rats in cargo ships from China were able to land on the Hawaiian islands unseen. As the rats, hosts for disease-carrying fleas, made their way deeper into the city, people started to fall ill. On December 12, 1899, the first case was confirmed. The Board of Health then quickly thought of ways to prevent the disease from spreading even further inland. Their solution was to burn down any buildings in Chinatown suspected of containing a source of the disease. On December 31, 1899, the board set the first fire. They had originally planned to burn only a few targeted buildings, and thought they could control the flames as each building was finished, but the fire got out of control, burning down untargeted neighboring buildings. The resulting fire caused many of Chinatown's homes to be destroyed and an estimated 4,000 people were left homeless.[32]\\r\\nAustralia suffered 12 major plague outbreaks between 1900 and 1925 originating from shipping.[33] Research by Australian medical officers Thompson, Armstrong and Tidswell contributed to understanding the spread of Yersinia pestis to humans by fleas from infected rats.[34]\\r\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the pandemic was considered active until 1959, when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year. In 1994, a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections (including 52 deaths) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague.\\r\\nThe scale of death and social upheaval associated with plague outbreaks has made the topic prominent in a number of historical and fictional accounts since the disease was first recognized. The Black Death in particular is described and referenced in numerous contemporary sources, some of which, including works by Chaucer, Boccaccio, and Petrarch, are considered part of the Western canon. The Decameron, by Boccaccio, is notable for its use of a frame story involving individuals who have fled Florence for a secluded villa to escape the Black Death. First person, sometimes sensationalized or fictionalized, accounts of living through plague years have also been popular across centuries and cultures.\\r\\nLater works, such as Albert Camus's novel The Plague or Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal have used bubonic plague in settings, such quarantined cities in either medieval or modern times, as a backdrop to explore a variety of concepts. Common themes include the breakdown of society, institutions, and individuals during the plague, the cultural and psychological existential confrontation with mortality, and the allegorical use of the plague in reference to contemporary moral or spiritual questions.\\r\\nSome of the earliest instances of biological warfare were said to have been products of the plague, as armies of the 14th century were recorded catapulting diseased corpses over the walls of towns and villages to spread the pestilence.\\r\\nLater, plague was used during the Second Sino-Japanese War as a bacteriological weapon by the Imperial Japanese Army. These weapons were provided by Shir Ishii's units and used in experiments on humans before being used on the field. For example, in 1940, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service bombed Ningbo with fleas carrying the bubonic plague.[35] During the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials, the accused, such as Major General Kiyashi Kawashima, testified that, in 1941, some 40 members of Unit 731 air-dropped plague-contaminated fleas on Changde. These operations caused epidemic plague outbreaks.[36]","input":"What kind of virus was the bubonic plague?"},{"output":"seven years","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Endgame\\" is the series finale of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager, episodes 25 and 26 of the seventh season and 171 and 172 in the overall series. It was originally shown May?23,?2001, on the UPN network as a double-length episode and later presented as such in DVD collections, but it is shown in syndicated broadcasts as a two-part story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the year 2404, the Federation is celebrating the tenth anniversary of Voyager's return to Earth from 23 years in the Delta Quadrant. An older Admiral Kathryn Janeway acquires a chrono deflector from a Klingon named Korath and uses it on her shuttle to travel back to 2378 in the Delta Quadrant. She pulls rank on her younger self, ordering Voyager to emit an anti-tachyon pulse that collapses the temporal distortion and prevents the Klingons from following her through.\\r\\n\\r\\nAboard her old starship, the Admiral tells her younger self to return to a nebula filled with Borg that they passed by a few days before. She provides advanced technologies that allow Voyager to bypass the massive Borg defenses and enter a transwarp corridor. Despite spying on the ship and preparing for its attack, the Borg are unable to penetrate Voyager's new adaptive hull armor or to capture it with tractor beams, while Voyager destroys two Borg cubes with transphasic torpedoes. Voyager then comes upon a Borg transwarp hub. Transit through the hub will save the ship sixteen more years of being stranded in the Delta Quadrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Admiral's efforts to get the crew home are hindered by the desire of her younger self to use the technology from the future to destroy the transwarp network instead of using it to return home. Trying to blast it from the inside is impossible, as the network adapts to any attack due to the control of the Borg Queen.[note 1] The hub can only be destroyed from the Delta Quadrant terminus because the Alpha Quadrant contains only exit apertures. The two Janeways argue over the issue until the elder Janeway tells her younger self that Seven of Nine and 22 other crew members will die if they do not take the transwarp conduit home, and that Vulcan Tactical Officer Tuvok will become mentally unstable from a neurological condition that could have been treated in the Alpha Quadrant had they had made it back soon enough. Deeply troubled by the knowledge that she is effectively ordering the deaths of her crew, Captain Janeway discusses the issue with them, but they too decide that destroying the Borg's transwarp hub is more important than returning to Earth, as without it, the Borg's ability to travel across the galaxy will be severely hampered and countless lives will be saved. On seeing the crew's selfless reaction to the plan, the older Janeway rediscovers her fighting spirit and, with Captain Janeway, comes up with a plan to both destroy the hub and possibly get Voyager home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdmiral Janeway takes her shuttlecraft and enters the transwarp hub, finally arriving at the Unicomplex  the center of all Borg activity and the home of the Borg Queen. Janeway appears in the Queens mind, claiming she wants Voyager towed back to the Alpha Quadrant (apparently in defiance of the younger Janeway's plans) in exchange for Voyager's armor and torpedo technologies. However, the Queen detects her shuttle and beams the Admiral to her chambers for assimilation into the Borg collective. A few minutes later, Admiral Janeway unleashes a neurolytic pathogen from her bloodstream that devastates the Borg and causes the queen's cyborg components to fall apart. With the deactivation of the Queen, the Unicomplex suffers a cascade failure and explodes, killing the partially assimilated Admiral.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, Captain Janeway and her crew have entered a transwarp corridor and fired torpedoes at the unprotected manifolds while traveling back to the Alpha Quadrant. They are pursued by a Borg sphere that has managed to withstand the pathogen's effects and assimilate Admiral Janeway's adaptive armor upgrades. The sphere is under orders from the Borg Queen to destroy Voyager so that the Admiral (and her sabotage) will not have occurred. Unable to fight back against the sphere's defenses, Janeway takes her ship inside the sphere, where, upon its arrival one light year away from Earth's solar system, she detonates a torpedo that destroys the sphere from the inside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the show's final minutes, the crew stand dumbfounded that they have finally returned home after seven years in the Delta Quadrant and are greeted by a fleet of Starfleet vessels that had arrived to fight the Borg. Settling down in her chair, Captain Janeway issues her final orders with the same words she used at the start of Voyager's journey from the Delta Quadrant: \\"Set a course...for home.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Star Trek franchise, a classic story plot-line is that characters from the future alter the past to change the future, as seen in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home or Yesterday's Enterprise. Within the Voyager series, an episode like Timeless also follows this narrative. This can create significant screen time of events that are destroyed as the past is altered.

(see also reboot)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was originally expected that a character would die in order to return Voyager to Earth, with Kate Mulgrew saying in an interview that one of the characters would die in one of the final frames of the series finale - but added that it didn't mean she was saying that it would be Janeway who would perish.[1] In 2015, Brannon Braga stated on Twitter that he felt that it should have been Seven of Nine who died in the finale,[2] and that he had written the episode \\"Human Error\\" specifically to set this up.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis episode won two Emmy Awards.

He was drafted by the Red Sox with the 40th overall pick in the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft after being named the 2010 College World Series Most Outstanding Player while attending the University of South Carolina.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradley began his college career in 2009 after attending Prince George High School in Prince George, Virginia. Prior to attending college, he had been named to the 2008 Virginia AAA All-State team and was listed as the 40th-best Virginia-based baseball prospect for the 2008 Major League Baseball draft by Baseball America.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the University of South Carolina in 2009, Bradley hit .349 and scored 69 runs in 63 games. Posting a slugging percentage of .537, he hit 11 home runs while walking 34 times and striking out 31 times. He spent the summer in the Cape Cod League with the Hyannis Mets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, he batted .368 and 13 home runs, driving in 60 runs while scoring 56 times in 67 games. Then, he went 10-for-29 at the plate in the 2010 College World Series, earning CWS Most Outstanding Player honors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBradley was selected 40th overall by the Boston Red Sox in the supplemental first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Bradley made his professional debut on August 23, 2011 with the Class-A Short Season Lowell Spinners, hitting .250 in 10 games split between the Spinners and Single-A Greenville Drive. Bradley was named Minor League Defensive Player of the Year by the Red Sox organization for the 2012 season. He hit .315 with 55 extra-base hits, 87 walks, and 63 RBIs in 128 games.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering 2013, Bradley ranked 32nd overall on the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list.[3] After an outstanding spring training, on March 31, manager John Farrell announced that Bradley would be the Opening Day left fielder on April 1 at Yankee Stadium.[4] Although he went hitless in two at-bats, Bradley had three walks, scored two runs, drove in one run, and made a couple of hustle plays on the basepath and in the field in the Red Sox' 8ÿ2 win over the Yankees.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBradley went 3-for-31 with three RBIs in Boston before being optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox on April 19; Bradley was demoted to accommodate David Ortiz, who started the 2013 season on a rehab assignment, recovering from a right Achilles injury. Bradley was recalled on May 29. He hit his first career home run on June 4 against the Texas Rangers.[6] Bradley was optioned back to Pawtucket on June 8 when Shane Victorino was activated from the disabled list. He was recalled again on July 9, and optioned back to Pawtucket on July 14. He was recalled on September 7.[7] In 37 Major League games of 2013, Bradley batted .189 with 3 home runs, 10 RBI, and 2 stolen bases. With the Red Sox finishing 97ÿ65, the team made the postseason and eventually won the World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals. Bradley still received his first career championship ring, although he did not play in the postseason.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 28, 2014, Bradley was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket after he was unable to beat Grady Sizemore for the starting center field position, but was recalled three days later after the team placed Shane Victorino on the 15-day disabled list. Bradley saw regular time as the team's center fielder throughout the 2014 season, but was optioned back to Triple-A Pawtucket on August 18 after hitting just .216 with one home run and 30 RBI, despite playing exceptional defense.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 25, 2015, Bradley was called back up to play right field for the Red Sox while Hanley Ramrez recuperated with a sore wrist.[9] In a June 30 game against the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marco Estrada, he hit his first home run since May 31, 2014.  On August 15, 2015, Bradley became only the eighth player in the modern era with five extra-base hits in one game, recording two home runs and three doubles in six at-bats, in the Red Sox' 22ÿ10 defeat of the Seattle Mariners. His play led to a starting job and widespread speculation that he would be part of the full-time Red Sox outfield in 2016 and beyond.[10][11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween April 24 and May 25, Bradley hit safely in 29 straight games, tying Johnny Damon for the fourth longest hitting streak in Red Sox history. Bradley's streak came to an end in a loss to the Colorado Rockies on May 26. At the time he started his hitting streak, he was batting .222, and when it ended he had raised his average up to .350. This streak, along with excellent defense, earned him AL Player of the Month recognition for May. Bradley was selected to the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, the first of his career. He started in left field, and was 2-for-2 at the plate.[12] He ended the 2016 season with a .267 batting average, 26 home runs, and 87 RBIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 2016 offseason, Bradley switched his uniform number to #19, previously worn by Koji Uehara since 2013.[13].\\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 8, 2017, Bradley fell to the ground after flying out and left the game. It was reported that Bradley suffered a sprain to his right knee. Two days later, on April 10, Bradley was placed on the 10-day disabled list.[14] On August 22, Bradley injured his left thumb while sliding towards home plate and left the game. The next day, on August 23, Bradley was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to spraining his left thumb.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nBradley was again the everyday center fielder for the Red Sox, and drew national attention for his stellar defense,[16][17][18][19] but struggled at the plate until mid-August.[18][20] On August 11, in the first game of a day-night doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles, Bradley homered twice to lift the Red Sox to a 5-0 victory.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nBradley Jr. is the son of Jackie Bradley Sr., a bus driver in Richmond, Virginia.[22] Bradley Jr. is married to Erin Helring;[23] their daughter Emerson Claire Bradley was born on June 2, 2016.

Stars are a familiar and popular symbol, with scales of one to three or five stars commonly used. Ratings appear in guide books as well as in the media, typically in newspapers, lifestyle magazines and webzines. Websites featuring consumer-written reviews and ratings are increasingly popular, but are far less reliable.[1]\\r\\nIn addition, there are ratings given by public health agencies rating the level of sanitation practiced by an establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the best known guides is the Michelin series which award one to three stars to restaurants they perceive to be of high culinary merit. One star indicates a \\"very good restaurant\\"; two stars indicate a place \\"worth a detour\\"; three stars means \\"exceptional cuisine, worth a special journey\\".\\r\\nSeveral bigger newspapers employ restaurant critics and publish online dining guides for the cities they serve, such as the Irish Independent for Irish restaurants.\\r\\nInternet restaurant review sites have empowered regular people to generate non-expert reviews. This has sparked criticism from restaurant establishments about the non-editorial, non-professional critiques. Those reviews can be falsified or faked.[1][3]\\r\\nThe different guides have their own criteria. Not every guide looks behind the scenes or decorum. Others look particularly sharply to value for money. This is why a restaurant can be missing in one guide, while mentioned in another. Because the guides work independently, it is possible to have simultaneous multiple recognitions.[4][5][6][7][8]\\r\\nA top restaurant rating can mean success or failure for a restaurant, particularly when bestowed by an influential sources such as Michelin. Still, a good rating is not enough for economic success and many Michelin starred and/or highly rated restaurants have met the same fate as the Dutch restaurant De Swaen.\\r\\nIn 2004, Michelin came under fire after bipolar chef Bernard Loiseau committed suicide after he was rumoured to be in danger of losing one of his three Michelin stars. However, the Michelin guide had stated he would not be downgraded. Most news reports attributed his suicide to the downgrade carried out by the rival Gault Millau guide.\\r\\nMany countries have a system of checks and inspections in place for sanitation. Only a few countries, amongst others the United States and Canada, create and publish restaurant ratings based on this. However, the whole of the United Kingdom is covered - as is Denmark.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn the United States, several states have imposed uniform statewide restaurant grading systems, under which safety and hygiene inspection reports are used to compute numerical scores or letter grades, and those must be prominently posted by restaurants.[9] The first state to enact such a statewide system was South Carolina in 1995.[9] Tennessee and North Carolina later enacted legislation imposing similar statewide systems.[9]\\r\\nIn many other states, the mandatory posting of restaurant grades is neither required nor prohibited statewide, which means it is purely a matter for local governments like cities and counties.[9]\\r\\nIn November 1997, a KCBS-TV sweeps news story called Behind The Kitchen Door focused attention on problems in Los Angeles's top restaurants. The station used hidden cameras to catch restaurant employees practicing unsafe food handling practices such as picking up food from the floor and re-serving it, vermin crawling near food to be served, and mixing uncooked meat and vegetables.[citation needed] The KCBS report also reviewed inspection reports, which have always been public records, but were available only on request (and at the time required an in-person visit to the health department), and found that many problems had already been expressly identified in the inspection reports but had not been adequately publicized.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a result of this report, in December 1997 the Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County introduced a letter grading system already in use for some years in two other nearby counties, San Diego County and Riverside County. Instead of merely listing violations in a report, the restaurant inspection system was changed to a point system, with each restaurant starting each inspection with a perfect score of 100 points.[9] Environmental health specialists were required to use a standard form called the Food Official Inspection Report to identify violations as they inspected establishments; the form required them to subtract a certain number of points for each violation found.[9] Based on the number of points remaining, letter grades were then assigned and required to be prominently posted at all establishments selling food, and all establishments were also required to provide a copy of the underlying inspection report to any customer on request.[9] Grades are available at the County Public Health Department's web site.[10]\\r\\nTwo Stanford University economics researchers found that higher lettered restaurants scored a rise in revenue, while lower lettered restaurants have seen their revenues decline. The quality of restaurants in the entire county became more acceptable, with the average score going up from about 75% to nearly 90% in the year after restaurant grading was implemented. The researchers concluded that the results were not explained solely by consumers switching to higher quality restaurants, and that some of the effect had to do with restaurants making changes due to grade cards.[11][12] Another study estimated a 13.1% reduction in hospitalization for food borne illnesses in the year following implementation of the program, suggesting that implementing a restaurant grading program could improve public safety.[13]\\r\\nAlthough Los Angeles County was not the first local jurisdiction to require restaurants to post grades, its success in implementing such a program inspired many other local governments during the 2000s to enact similar programs based on the Los Angeles model, such as Toronto, Las Vegas, Dallas, and New York City.[9]","input":"What is the highest number of michelin stars a resturant can receive?"},{"output":"Googles Assistant","context":"Siri (pronounced /?s??ri/) is an intelligent personal assistant, part of Apple Inc.'s iOS, watchOS, macOS, and tvOS operating systems. The assistant uses voice queries and a natural language user interface to attempt to answer questions, make recommendations, and perform actions by delegating requests to a set of Internet services. The software adapts to users' individual language usages, searches, and preferences, with continuing use. Returned results are individualized.\\r\\nSiri is a spin-off from a project originally developed by the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center. Its speech recognition engine is provided by Nuance Communications, and Siri uses advanced machine learning technologies to function. Its original American, British, and Australian voice actors recorded their respective voices around 2005, unaware of the recordings' eventual usage in Siri. The voice assistant was released as an app for iOS in February 2010, and it was acquired by Apple two months later. Siri was then integrated into iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011. At that time, the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store. Siri has become an integral part of Apple's products, having been adapted into other hardware devices over the years, including newer iPhone models, as well as iPad, iPod Touch, Mac, AirPods, Apple TV and the upcoming HomePod.\\r\\nSiri supports a wide range of user commands, including performing phone actions, checking basic information, scheduling events and reminders, handling device settings, searching the Internet, navigating areas, finding information on entertainment, and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps. With the release of iOS 10 in 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri, including third-party messaging apps, as well as payments, ride-sharing, and Internet calling apps. With the release of iOS 11, Apple has updated Siri's voices for more clear, human voices, supports follow-up questions and language translation, and additional third-party actions.\\r\\nSiri's original release on iPhone 4S in 2011 received mixed reviews. It received praise for its voice recognition and contextual knowledge of user information, including calendar appointments, but was criticized for requiring stiff user commands and having a lack of flexibility. It was also criticized for lacking information on certain nearby places, and for its inability to understand certain English accents. In 2016 and 2017, a number of media reports have indicated that Siri is lacking in innovation, particularly against new competing voice assistants from other technology companies. The reports concerned Siri's limited set of features, \\"bad\\" voice recognition, and undeveloped service integrations as causing trouble for Apple in the field of artificial intelligence and cloud-based services; the basis for the complaints reportedly due to stifled development, as caused by Apple's prioritization of user privacy and executive power struggles within the company.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSiri is a spin-out from the SRI International Artificial Intelligence Center, and is an offshoot of the DARPA-funded CALO project.[2] It was co-founded by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer, and Tom Gruber.[2]\\r\\nSiri's speech recognition engine is provided by Nuance Communications, a speech technology company.[3] This was not officially acknowledged by Apple nor Nuance for years,[4][5] until Nuance CEO Paul Ricci confirmed the information at a 2011 technology conference.[3] The speech recognition system makes use of sophisticated machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory.[6]\\r\\nApple's first notion of a digital personal assistant was originally a concept video in 1987, called the \\"Knowledge Navigator\\".[7][8]\\r\\nThe original American voice of Siri was provided by Susan Bennett in July 2005, unaware that it would eventually be used for the voice assistant.[9] A report from The Verge in September 2013 about voice actors, their work, and machine learning developments, made hints that Allison Dufty was the voice behind Siri,[10][11] though this was disproven when Dufty wrote on her website that she was \\"absolutely, positively NOT the voice of Siri\\".[9] Citing growing pressure, Bennett revealed her role as Siri in October, and her claim was proven by Ed Primeau, an American audio forensics expert.[9] Apple has never confirmed the information.[9]\\r\\nThe original British male voice was provided by Jon Briggs, a former technology journalist. Having discovered that he was the voice of Siri by watching television, he first spoke only about his role in November 2011, also acknowledging his voice work was done \\"five or six years ago\\" without knowing the recordings' final usage form.[12][13]\\r\\nThe original Australian voice was provided by Karen Jacobsen, a voice-over artist known in Australia for her work as the \\"GPS girl\\".[14]\\r\\nAs part of an interview between all three voice actors and The Guardian, Briggs stated that \\"The original system was recorded for a US company called Scansoft, who were then bought by Nuance. Apple simply licensed it.\\"[14]\\r\\nWith iOS 11, Apple auditioned \\"hundreds of candidates\\" to find a new female voice, then recorded hours of speech, including different personalities and expressions, and built a new text-to-speech voice based on deep learning technology.[15]\\r\\nSiri was originally released as a stand-alone application for the iOS operating system in February 2010, and at the time, the developers were also intending to release Siri for Android and BlackBerry devices.[16] Two months later, Apple acquired Siri.[17][18][19] On October 4, 2011, Apple introduced the iPhone 4S with a beta version of Siri.[20][21] After the announcement, Apple removed the existing standalone Siri app from App Store.[22] TechCrunch wrote that, despite the Siri app's support for iPhone 4, its removal from App Store might also have had a financial aspect for the company, in providing an incentive for customers to upgrade devices.[22] Third-party developer Steven Troughton-Smith, however, managed to port Siri to iPhone 4, though without being able to communicate with Apple's servers.[23] A few days later, Troughton-Smith, working with an anonymous person nicknamed \\"Chpwn\\", managed to fully hack Siri, enabling its full functionalities on iPhone 4 and iPod Touch devices.[24] Additionally, developers were also able to successfully create and distribute legal ports of Siri to any device capable of running iOS 5, though a proxy server was required for Apple server interaction.[25]\\r\\nOver the years, Apple has expanded the line of officially supported products, including newer iPhone models,[26] as well as iPad support in June 2012,[27] iPod Touch support in September 2012,[28] Apple TV support, and the standalone Siri Remote, in September 2015,[29] Mac and AirPods support in September 2016,[30][31] and HomePod support. Homepod does not currently have a set release date.[32]\\r\\nApple offers a wide range of voice commands to interact with Siri, including, but not limited to:[33]\\r\\nSiri also offers numerous pre-programmed responses to amusing questions. Such questions include \\"What is the meaning of life?\\", to which Siri may reply \\"All evidence to date suggests it's chocolate\\"; \\"Why am I here?\\", to which it may reply \\"I don't know. Frankly, I've wondered that myself\\"; and \\"Will you marry me?\\", to which it may respond with \\"My End User Licensing Agreement does not cover marriage. My apologies\\".[34][35]\\r\\nInitially limited to female voices, Apple announced in June 2013 that Siri would feature a gender option, adding a male voice counterpart.[36]\\r\\nIn September 2014, Apple added the ability for users to speak \\"Hey Siri\\" to enable the assistant without the requirement of physically handling the device.[37]\\r\\nIn September 2015, the \\"Hey Siri\\" feature was updated to include individualized voice recognition, a presumed effort to prevent non-owner activation.[38][39]\\r\\nWith the announcement of iOS 10 in June 2016, Apple opened up limited third-party developer access to Siri through a dedicated application programming interface (API). The API restricts usage of Siri to engaging with third-party messaging apps, payment apps, ride-sharing apps, and Internet calling apps.[40][41]\\r\\nIn iOS 11, Siri is able to handle follow-up questions, supports language translation, and opens up to more third-party actions, including task management.[42][43] Additionally, users are able to type to Siri,[44] and a new, privacy-minded \\"on-device learning\\" technique improves Siri's suggestions by privately analyzing personal usage of different iOS applications.[45]\\r\\nSiri received mixed reviews during its \\"beta\\" release as an integrated part of iPhone 4S in October 2011.\\r\\nMG Siegler of TechCrunch wrote that Siri was \\"great\\", adding that \\"The amount of times Siri hasnt been able to understand and execute my request is astonishingly low\\". Siegler further praised the potential for Siri after losing the \\"beta\\" tag, writing \\"Just imagine what will happen when Apple partners with other services to expand Siri further. And imagine when they have an API that any developer can use. This really could alter the mobile landscape\\".[46]\\r\\nWriting for The New York Times, David Pogue also praised Siri, writing that it \\"thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted response and speaks in a calm female voice\\". Pogue praised Siri's language understanding, stating that \\"Its mind-blowing how inexact your utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, Whats the weather going to be like in Tucson this weekend? to Will I need an umbrella tonight?\\". Pogue also equally praised Siri's ability to understand context, using the example of \\"Once, I tried saying, Make an appointment with Patrick for Thursday at 3. Siri responded, Note that you already have an all-day appointment about Boston Trip for this Thursday. Shall I schedule this anyway? Unbelievable\\".[47]\\r\\nJacqui Cheng of Ars Technica wrote that Apple's claims of what Siri could do were \\"bold\\", and the early demos \\"even bolder\\". Cheng wrote that \\"Though Siri shows real potential, these kinds of high expectations are bound to be disappointed\\", adding that \\"Apple makes clear that the product is still in betaan appropriate label, in our opinion\\". While praising its ability to \\"decipher our casual language\\" and deliver \\"very specific and accurate result\\", sometimes even providing additional information, Cheng noted and criticized its restrictions, particularly when the language moved away from \\"stiffer commands\\" into more human interactions. One example included the phrase \\"Send a text to Jason, Clint, Sam, and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud\\", which Siri interpreted as sending a message to Jason only, containing the text \\"Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud\\". She also noted a lack of proper editability, as saying \\"Edit message to say: we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us\\", generated \\"Clint Sam and Lee saying we're having dinner at Silver Cloud to say we're at Silver Cloud and you should come find us\\".[48]\\r\\nGoogle's executive chairman and former chief, Eric Schmidt, conceded that Siri could pose a \\"competitive threat\\" to the company's core search business.[49]\\r\\nSiri was criticized by pro-choice abortion organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and NARAL Pro-Choice America, after users found that Siri could not provide information about the location of birth control or abortion providers nearby, sometimes directing users to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers instead.[50][51][52] Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for Apple, told The New York Times that \\"Our customers want to use Siri to find out all types of information, and while it can find a lot, it doesnt always find what you want\\", adding \\"These are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone. It simply means that as we bring Siri from beta to a final product, we find places where we can do better, and we will in the coming weeks\\".[53] In January 2016, Fast Company reported that, in then-recent months, Siri had begun to confuse the word \\"abortion\\" with \\"adoption\\", citing \\"health experts\\" who stated that the situation had \\"gotten worse\\". However, at the time of Fast Company's report, the situation had changed slightly, with Siri offering \\"a more comprehensive list of Planned Parenthood facilities\\", although \\"Adoption clinics continue to pop up, but near the bottom of the list.\\"[54][55]\\r\\nSiri has also not been well received by some English speakers with distinctive accents, including Scottish[56] and Americans from Boston or the South.[57]\\r\\nIn March 2012, Frank M. Fazio filed a class action lawsuit against Apple on behalf of the people who bought iPhone 4S and felt misled about the capabilities of Siri, alleging its failing to function as depicted in Apple's Siri commercials. Fazio filed the lawsuit in California and claimed that the iPhone 4S was merely a \\"more expensive iPhone 4\\" if Siri fails to function as advertised.[58][59] On July 22, 2013, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken in San Francisco dismissed the suit but said the plaintiffs could amend at a later time. The reason given for dismissal was that plaintiffs did not sufficiently document enough misrepresentations by Apple for the trial to proceed.[60]\\r\\nIn June 2016, The Verge's Sean O'Kane wrote about the then-upcoming major iOS 10 updates, with a headline stating \\"Siri's big upgrades won't matter if it can't understand its users\\". O'Kane wrote that \\"What Apple didnt talk about was solving Siris biggest, most basic flaws: its still not very good at voice recognition, and when it gets it right, the results are often clunky. And these problems look even worse when you consider that Apple now has full-fledged competitors in this space: Amazons Alexa, Microsofts Cortana, and Googles Assistant.\\"[61] Also writing for The Verge, Walt Mossberg had previously questioned Apple's efforts in cloud-based services, writing:[62]\\r\\n[...] perhaps the biggest disappointment among Apple's cloud-based services is the one it needs most today, right now: Siri. Before Apple bought it, Siri was on the road to being a robust digital assistant that could do many things, and integrate with many services  even though it was being built by a startup with limited funds and people. After Apple bought Siri, the giant company seemed to treat it as a backwater, restricting it to doing only a few, slowly increasing number of tasks, like telling you the weather, sports scores, movie and restaurant listings, and controlling the device's functions. Its unhappy founders have left Apple to build a new AI service called Viv. And, on too many occasions, Siri either gets things wrong, doesn't know the answer, or can't verbalize it. Instead, it shows you a web search result, even when you're not in a position to read it.\\r\\nIn October 2016, Bloomberg reported that Apple had plans to unify the teams behind its various cloud-based services, including a single campus and reorganized cloud computing resources aimed at improving the processing of Siri's queries,[63] though another report from The Verge in June 2017 once again called Siri's voice recognition \\"bad\\".[64]\\r\\nIn June 2017, The Wall Street Journal published an extensive report on the lack of innovation with Siri following competitors' advancement in the field of voice assistants. Noting that Apple workers' anxiety levels \\"went up a notch\\" on the announcement of Amazon's Alexa, the Journal wrote that \\"Today, Apple is playing catch-up in a product category it invented, increasing worries about whether the technology giant has lost some of its innovation edge\\". The report cites the primary causes as being Apple's prioritization of user privacy, including randomly-tagged six-month Siri searches, whereas Google and Amazon keep data until actively discarded by the user, and executive power struggles with some employees leaving. Apple declined to comment on the report, while Eddy Cue said that \\"Apple often uses generic data rather than user data to train its systems and has the ability to improve Siris performance for individual users with information kept on their iPhones\\".[1][65]\\r\\nSee also: Logic machines in fiction and List of fictional computers","input":"What is the name of the google siri?"},{"output":"19 March 2018","context":"Sudan (1973 ÿ 19 March 2018) was a captive northern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) who lived at the Dv?r Krlov Zoo in Czechia from 1975[3] to 2009, and the rest of his life at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya.[4] At the time of his death, he was one of only three living northern white rhinoceroses in the world, and the last known male of his subspecies. Sudan was euthanised on 19 March 2018, after suffering from \\"age-related complications\\".[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of six northern white rhinoceros including the two years old Sudan was captured in Shambe, Sudan by animal trappers employed by Chipperfield's Circus in February 1975[5][6] working under agreement with Josef Vgner, the then director of the Dv?r Krlov Zoo in Czechoslovakia (now Czechia).[7] The captured group comprised two males (Sudan and Saut) and four females (Nola, Nuri, Nadi and Nesari).\\r\\nThe number of northern white rhinos was already considered to be only around 700 animals in the wild.[7] For many environmentalists, leaving the animals in nature was the only acceptable way of preserving the already rare subspecies. The Dv?r Krlov Zoo and their Chipperfield partners were then criticized for the capture.[7] The zoo was specialising in African fauna and already had their largest collection out of Africa.[7]\\r\\nIn 1975 the group including Sudan was shipped to the Dv?r Krlov Zoo for their northern white rhinoceros display.[8] The zoo was the only one in the world where northern white rhinos have sucessfully given birth, with the last calf being born in 2000.[9]\\r\\nTwo years later they were joined by Nasima, who originated from Uganda but came from Knowsley Safari Park[10] near Prescot, and Saut was later lent to San Diego Zoo in the United States.[11]\\r\\nAfter 1980, the northern white rhinos were wiped out in Uganda and Sudan, and 13 were left in Garamba National Park in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Conservation Breeding Specialist Group of the IUCN met in 1986 in Dv?r Krlov Zoo to discuss the ways to preserve the dwindling number of northern white rhinos. The efforts to save the subspecies included the import of Ben (an older male from London) in 1986 and the return of Saut (a calf from the original 1975 group) from San Diego Zoo in 1998 to Dv?r Krlov Zoo. Attempts to join the group with several southern rhinos met only with mixed success. Several surgeries were performed on the females and their eggs; genetic material, including Sudan's semen, was preserved.[12]\\r\\nSudan fathered three calves in the Czech Republic and became the grandfather of one. Sudan fathered Nabire (dam: Nasima, studbook number 0351),[13] who was born 15 November 1983,[14] and died at Dv?r Krlov Zoo July 2015.[15] He was also the father of Najin, who was transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy along with him in 2009. Najin was born in 1989, again with the dam being Nasima. Sudan has also sired one other offspring besides Nabire and Najin. The third calf was born prematurely and died.[8] Sudan was the grandfather of Fatu through his daughter Najin.[16] For breeding, Sudan's studbook number was 0372.[13]\\r\\nThe Dv?r Krlov rhinos were getting older and after 2000 no more calves were being born around the world.\\r\\nThe second-to-last male northern white rhinoceros in the world was Angalifu, who lived at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park with Nola until his death on 14 December 2014.[17] Angalifu was beyond breeding age, leaving Sudan as the only fertile male in the world even when Angalifu was alive.[18]\\r\\nIn June 2008 specialists met in the Dv?r Krlov Zoo to decide further steps to save the subspecies. The meeting of the Czech Zoo with IUCN African Rhino Specialist Group (AfRSG), World Zoo and Aquarium Association WAZA, Berlin institute IZW as well as experts from Vienna Veterinary institute and the European Zoo and Aquarium Association EAZA recommended to move Sudan and his group from Czechia to Africa. Substantial debate succeeded and strong objections were raised against this proposal, especially given the fact that expert and scientific organisations were available in Europe and insemination efforts could have continued in Czechia.[19]\\r\\nIn December 2009 the rhinos were moved to the Ol Pejeta Conservancy for a \\"Last Chance To Survive\\" breeding program, along with three other northern white rhinoceroses. It was hoped that Ol Pejeta would provide a more natural habitat and better hormonal balance for the animals to induce breeding.[5][20] However, breeding attempts with Sudan at Ol Pejeta Conservancy were unsuccessful.[21]\\r\\nOne of the other three rhinos transported in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Suni, died in 2014.[22] Sudan then lived the final years of his life with his daughter Najin and granddaughter Fatu.\\r\\nNorthern white rhinoceroses are guarded 24 hours a day at the conservancy to protect them from poaching, which is a major problem for rhinoceroses. The protection includes horn-embedded transmitters, watchtowers, fences, drones, guard dogs, and trained armed guards around the clock.[23]\\r\\nAt the end of 2017, Sudan suffered from an infection in his right hind leg. Although his condition improved in subsequent months, the infection returned, and, in March 2018, his state seriously deteriorated, despite intensive care.[24][25] Sudan was euthanised on 19 March 2018, after suffering from \\"age-related complications\\".[5]\\r\\nIn the weeks before Sudan's death, Richard Vigne, CEO of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, stated that Sudan has been technically infertile for many years, so him dying is not going to affect the possibilities of recovery for the northern white rhino as a species.\\"[25]\\r\\nAfter the death of Sudan, Dv?r Krlov Zoo spokesman Jan Stejskal, declared that \\"We must take advantage of the unique situation in which cellular technologies are utilised for conservation of critically endangered species. It may sound unbelievable, but thanks to the newly developed techniques even Sudan could still have an offspring.\\"[26]\\r\\nThere are now ongoing attempts at in vitro fertilization of eggs from Najin and Fatu with semen from Sudan and to implant the resulting blastocysts in suitable female southern white rhinos.[27] In total, eggs from two females and semen from five males are now available for the subspecies' possible future resurrection.[28]\\r\\nIn February 2015, Ol Pejeta Conservancy launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for the rangers guarding the rhinos.[29][30] In May 2015, after contacting Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Dubai-based Pakistani entrepreneurs Hamid Hussain and Muhammad Yaqoob started a global campaign to create awareness and bring people to Ol Pejeta Conservancy to help in generating revenues for the IVF treatments and other forms of assisted reproduction by inviting celebrities to visit the conservancy. Among the celebrities who visited Sudan were actors Nargis Fakhri and Khaled Abol Naga.[31][32]\\r\\nIn 2017, Ol Pejeta Conservancy teamed up with Tinder and Ogilvy Africa to launch a fundraising campaign in order to recover the species. They created a Tinder account for Sudan, the last standing male of northern white rhinos, and the app's users could swipe right to make their donations for the development of breeding methods.[33][34]","input":"When did sudan the last white rhino die?"},{"output":"cuneiform","context":"","input":"What was the assyrians form of writing known as?"},{"output":"Shane Warne","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nT20I kit\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rajasthan Royals (often abbreviated as RR) are a cricket team in the Indian Premier League from the city of Jaipur.[1] Founded in 2008 as one of the initial eight IPL franchises, the Royals are owned by Manoj Badale. The team played its home matches at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur and also had secondary home grounds at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Ahmedabad and the Brabourne Stadium at Mumbai.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royals are sometimes considered the Moneyball team of the IPL.[2][3][4] The Royals are known to unearth obscure, high potential talent.[5][6][7] The team won the inaugural edition of the IPL under the captaincy of Shane Warne, despite being written off as a title contender by the media and fans. The Royals were also the runners-up of the 2013 Champions League Twenty20 under Rahul Dravid's captaincy.[7][8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 July 2015 the verdict reached by a panel appointed by India's Supreme Court suspended Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings for two years over a corruption and match fixing scandal, meaning they could not participate in both the 2016 and 2017 IPL tournaments. They returned to the competition for the 2018 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's record run-scorer and current captain is Ajinkya Rahane, with 2705 runs [9], while the leading wicket-taker is Shane Watson, with 67 [10].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced in September 2007 the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.[11] In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The team is one of the eight founding members of the IPL in 2008. The Jaipur franchise was sold to the Emerging Media for $67 million, making it the least expensive team in the league.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe franchise is currently owned and chaired by Manoj Badale. Other investors include Lachlan Murdoch, Aditya S Chellaram, and Suresh Chellaram. The Group acquired the franchise for $67million.[12] Incidentally, this was the least expensive franchise in the Indian Premier League and probably the least fancied team in the league at the beginning of the tournament.[13] It made a pre-tax profit of $7.5 million in 2009.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2010, the BCCI decided to expel Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals from the IPL. The expulsion baffled captain Shane Warne who stated that he suspected that there might be some foul play and that the BCCI might possess some ulterior motives.[15] The Rajasthan Royals however filed an appeal against the decision and the two parties went to the Mumbai High Court to decide[16] The Mumbai high-court adjourned that case until 29 October 2010.[17] Both parties then agreed to adjourn the case again to 15 November because they didn't want it to coincide with Diwali celebrations from 1 to 14 November[18] Later it was announced by the Royals that they told the Bombay High Court that they would be negotiating with an arbitrator to see if they could reconcile with the IPL[19] The arbitrator announced that while the investigation was ongoing the Royals would remain a part of the IPL for six-weeks and the BCCI would not be allowed to change rules which might go against the Royals. The six-week period included the player auction in which Rajasthan Royals participated.[20] After this the Bombay High Court rejected the appeals of the BCCI against keeping the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL for six-weeks while the case was sorted out.[21] It was estimated because of the losses in court cases and damaging reputation the BCCI decided not to pursue any further legal action against Royals' or Kings XI Punjab and announced they decided to keep them in the IPL.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015 the team was banned for two years following the Lodha Panel inquiry.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals became the source of controversy when inappropriate and fictitious bids were made, violating BCCI norms.[24] Ranjit Barthakur and Fraser Castellino were the only two shareholders of the Jaipur IPL, completely unknown to the BCCI at the time.[25][26] An out of court settlement between the two later ensued.[27]\\r\\nIn 2015 Rajasthan Royals were banned for two years by the BCCI, with its owner Raj Kundra[28][better?source?needed] banned for life.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to the start of the inaugural IPL season, many considered the Royals as possibly the weakest team in the IPL, giving them little chance of competing well in the tournament.[30] Evidence of the latter opinion seemed to be confirmed when the team lost its first match against the Delhi Daredevils in a 9 wicket loss.[31] The fears were confirmed that the team was likely to struggle, but no one had ever thought that this was the beginning of a new dawn for the team. But the team believed in writing their own script and there was something about their style of cricket, perhaps the simple attitude with which they approached the game. This simplicity was bought about largely by Warne's captaincy, as he never had the fear to lose and was always calm in dealing with his players and pressure situations.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their first home game ever at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, they played against the Kings XI Punjab and won by 6 wickets as Shane Watson was declared the man of the match for his unbeaten 76 off 49 balls in what was a successful run chase. That was followed by a crucial 3 wicket win against one of the favorites to win the competition, Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad. The victory proved to be a huge morale booster for the side since this was their first away win and second successful run chase on the trot, as Yusuf Pathan made a name for himself with his first man of the match award for his bowling figures of 2/20 in 4 overs and a 28-ball 61.\\r\\n\\r\\nWatson almost replicated Yusuf's all-round performance in the following match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore as another run chase was completed. In the 7 wicket victory, Watto picked 2/20 in 4 overs and smashed 61 not out off 41 balls. Their next game was another crucial one, against the Kolkata Knight Riders at home and Rajasthan won convincingly by 45 runs as the diminutive opener from Goa, Swapnil Asnodkar received his first man of the match award for a fine knock of 60 off just 34 balls.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey further managed to defeat the Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur, as Pakistan's Sohail Tanvir continued to show his red hot bowling form in the game, picking 6 wickets for 14 runs in 4 overs, winning the man of the match award for the same. But a minor hiccup followed, as they were thrashed by 7 wickets by the unpredictable Mumbai Indians in Navi Mumbai.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the Royals won their next game by defeating the Kings XI Punjab and continued to win the next five games in a row. The Royals built up an impressive 11ÿ3 record after their fourteen preliminary round matches; this included a consecutive 5-game and 6-game winning streak with an undefeated record on their home ground and a spot at the top of the points table. They were also the first team to book a place in the semifinals with their 65 run win over the Royal Challengers Bangalore.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeccan Chargers were denied their first victory against the Rajasthan Royals, once again due to the burly Yusuf Pathan, who won his second man of the match award for his 37-ball 68 as Rajasthan prevailed by 8 wickets at home. There were two more home games on the trot, as the Delhi Daredevils were beaten this time by 3 wickets with Watto again performing his all-round magic to bewilder the opposition, as he ended with 2/21 in 4 overs and hit a 40-ball 74 to guide the chase adequately enough in the end. Whereas, the Royal Challengers Bangalore were thrashed by 65 runs, as South Africa's captain Graeme Smith won the man of the match award for his unbeaten 49-ball 75.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir next challenge was to conquer the nerves which can be developed when playing at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. But the home team was given a proper thumping by Yusuf Pathan who hammered an unbeaten 48 off just 18 balls, and backed it with bowling figures of 1/14 in 2 overs as Rajasthan Royals won by 6 wickets. They were however, given a tough fight by the Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in their 10-run victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowed by which, their last home game of the season was against the Mumbai Indians and Warne's boys ensured that they remained at the top of the points table in the conclusion of the round robin stage, with a 5-wicket win as Tanvir once again was devastating, picking 4/14 in his 4 overs. They did lose to the Kings XI Punjab in the final round robin game, but easily made it to the semifinals and Sohail Tanvir won the first ever Purple Cap in IPL history, for taking the most number of wickets in the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nShane Warne's captaincy and simultaneous coaching was praised and well received by everyone,[33][34] including opposition teams.[35] In addition, several players of the Royals team had consistently played well. Their semifinal was against the Delhi Daredevils in Mumbai, which was expected to be a tough contest for them. Yet, Delhi were walloped by 105 runs as Watto made this a one-sided contest following his 29-ball 52 and 3/10 in 3 overs, hence continuing his purple patch in the competition and assuring a place for Rajasthan in the final against MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings in the same city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final was a cliffhanger, which was ideal to end the first ever IPL tournament. Chennai could play their best possible to attempt stopping an in-form Rajasthan Royals. Although their team total after 20 overs was around 150, they took the match till the final ball until appropriately. With the scores level with one ball remaining, it was their bowling hero Sohail Tanvir who hit the winning runs to ensure that Rajasthan were crowned the champions of the first season of the IPL, making history in the process. Yusuf Pathan was declared the man of the match in the final as well, for his figures of 3/22 in 4 overs and 56 runs and thus became a household name ever since, beating the popularity of his younger brother Irfan Pathan and going on to represent India in the shorter formats of the game.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe all-rounder Shane Watson won the man of the tournament award for scoring as many as 472 runs and picking 17 wickets. This was able to make him cement his spot in all formats of the game in the Australian team, and has now become one of the most valuable T20 players in world cricket. It was an incredible victory for an underdog team which had inexperienced, young Indian cricketers mostly who could mainly speak in their mother tongues, which Warne could not understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the Champions League T20 that year, but the event was cancelled on the account of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in November 2008. The Rajasthan Royals became the winner of the first IPL tournament, when they defeated the Chennai Super Kings by 3 wickets in the final played on 1 June 2008. With the scores level with one ball remaining, Sohail Tanvir scored the winning run and therefore prevented the match from being decided on a bowl out.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nEach player and representative on the team was awarded a medal and the team was presented with the DLF Indian Premier League trophy along with a cheque for US$1.2 million prize money. Many of the Royals' players also took home individual awards for their performance during the tournament; Yusuf Pathan claimed the Man of the Match award for the final match, Sohail Tanvir~ finished the tournament in possession of the Purple Cap (the IPL's leading wicket taker) and Australian all-rounder Shane Watson was declared the Man of the Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royals came into the tournament in South Africa as the defending champions, but not one of the favourites since Sohail Tanvir was ineligible to play for the team due to the ban imposed by the BCCI on Pakistani players playing in the competition. As well as the fact that Shane Watson, theiaround was unavailable for the whole season as Australia toured to UAE for ODI series against Pakistan. Without these two, the team looked slightly weaker than the previous season and players such as the countryman Graeme Smith, fiery pacer Shaun Tait and the aging Shane Warne had to be relied on.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan began their 2009 campaign against the Royal Challengers Bangalore solemnly. They were bowled out for the Second lowest \\r\\nscore (First lowest score is of RCB against KKR in 2017 they made a score of 49 and were all out) in the history of the IPL, a paltry 58 as they were thrashed by 75 runs in Newlands, Cape Town by the Kevin Pietersen-led side. They made a short trip to Durban to play the Mumbai Indians but that match was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan go at the bottom of the points table at that stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on their return to Cape Town, they faced the Kolkata Knight Riders in a match which went to the Super Over, and Rajasthan were only able to win due to Yusuf Pathan's onslaught off the bowling of Ajantha Mendis, knocking off the required 17 runs in just 4 balls. At the same ground although, they were defeated by the Kings XI Punjab by 27 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nYusuf again played a blinder of an innings, an unbeaten 30-ball 62 to help Rajasthan Royals beat Delhi Daredevils yet again, by 5 wickets. But the team that they met in the final last season, Chennai Super Kings was too good for them in their first clash of the season in Pretoria where Chennai won by 38 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Yusuf was at his all-round best as the Royals beat the Deccan Chargers by 3 wickets as he bowled well in his 4 overs, with figures of 1/19 and contributing 24 runs off 17 balls. They also were able to hammer Kings XI Punjab by 78 runs in their return match in Durban as Graeme Smith made the decibel levels on the ground increase with his 44-ball 77. Whereas, they took their revenge against the Royal Challengers Bangalore, prevailing by 7 wickets as the team rode on the unknown Indian pacer, Amit Singh's spell of 4/19 in 4 overs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen disaster struck. They lost yet another contest to the Chennai Super Kings, by 7 wickets and Deccan Chargers posted their first win against the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, by a massive margin of 53 runs. The Royals managed to shut out the Mumbai Indians by a mere 2 runs due to Warne's brilliance but were knocked out of the tournament with back-to-back defeats to the Delhi Daredevils by 14 runs and the bottom-ranked Kolkata Knight Riders by 3 wickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeven players were dropped from the team and they were sent back to home. These players were ÿ Mohammed Kaif, Dinesh Salunkhe, Paras Dogra, Anup Revandkar, Srideep Mangela, Ashraf Makda and Azhar Malik.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals ended 6th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 matches out of the 14 they played. The Royals failed to make it to the semifinals after losing their last two matches against Delhi Daredevils and Kolkata Knight Riders. It was a disappointing finish for Warne's boys, who had won many hearts with their 2008 performance.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 14 May 2009 it was announced that Rajasthan Royals would meet Middlesex Crusaders in a one-off Twenty20 for the British Asian Cup. It was the first time that an annual charity series to be played between the Twenty20 champions of the two countries. The match took place on 6 July 2009. The Squads were announced on 3 July 2009 with Rajasthan Royals included Mohammad Kaif and also saw a comeback of Sohail Tanvir.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe match was won by Rajasthan Royals by 46 runs after scoring 162/5 in 20 overs and successfully defending it by 46 runs (Middlesex 116/7). The MoM was Dimitri Mascarenhas.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royals were back in India after their average outing in South Africa. This time they seemed to be a better outfit as they were to play in conditions which should have suited them the most. But they had to suffer an unfortunate start to the competition, with a narrow 4 run defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The highlight of this match though, was Yusuf Pathan hitting the fastest ever hundred in IPL history, off only 37 balls! Even some of the Mumbai fans were disappointed not to see Rajasthan win, by the end of it all.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went on to lose to the Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets on one of their new home grounds, Ahmedabad. And were again bruised badly by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won by 10 wickets. The team remained inconsistent throughout the whole season, winning their next four matches consecutively. One of the young Turks of the erstwhile ICL, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala impressed against the franchise representing his home state, Kolkata Knight Riders as his 36-ball 45 helped the Royals win by 34 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowed by which the Western Australian batsman Adam Voges hit 45 runs off 24 balls to help Rajasthan beat Punjab in Mohali by 31 runs.  The team seemed to have adapted to the Ahmedabad conditions better with wins against Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets as Yusuf Pathan continued his good form against the team, while they beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs courtesy wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha's 49-ball 80.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut they lost against Chennai in their return clash as Murali Vijay's hundred took the game away from them as well as were crushed in Delhi by 67 runs. But they managed to escape a Deccan Chargers attack, with a narrow 2 run victory in Nagpur and continued their unbeaten run in Jaipur though, as the out of sorts Kings XI Punjab were duly beaten by 9 wickets with English opener Michael Lumb winning the man of the match award for his 43-ball 83.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, Rajasthan Royals ended the tournament miserably with losses to Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at home, and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the last round robin game in Kolkata. Consequently, they failed to make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive season as they finished 7th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 games out of 14 played.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Rajasthan Royals, and the Kings XI Punjab were temporarily ejected from the league due to issues with their unreported ownership changes. The teams were reinstated with involvement from the High Court.[41] Their owners were broken into several legal entities when the BCCI required the incorporation of the companies.[42][43] Kochi was also at risk of ejection for the same reasons before BCCI cleared their new ownership pattern for the tournament.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team management decided to retain the Australian duo of Shane Warne and Shane Watson for the following three seasons of the IPL, although Warne's future continued to be uncertain. Yet, he decided to make this his final season for the Rajasthan Royals on the insistence of the team owners who felt that he was the ultimate source of inspiration for the team on and off the field.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the auction, the team's funds were reduced since they were penalised by the BCCI in 2010 and as a result, had to pay a certain amount of bank guarantee as fixed by the High Court. But they possessed an adequate amount of money to buy some of the world's finest T20 players, which they did not exactly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey managed to buy back Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait for US$ 300,000 as well as South African bowling all-rounder Johan Botha for US$ 950,000. The other star players which they picked were New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor for US$ 1 million as well as The Wall Rahul Dravid for half that price. England's World T20 2010 winning skipper Paul Collingwood was also purchased for a mere US$ 250,000. The other players were mostly from the domestic circuits, but were confident individuals following Rajasthan winning the Ranji Trophy that year.\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals began the IPL 2011 in grand fashion, beating the Kumar Sangakkara-led Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets, with the young Indian pacer Siddharth Trivedi adjudged the man of the match for his spell of 3/15 and the Royals continued their fine record against the Chargers. While Shane Warne defied age with a fine piece of bowling to assist Rajasthan in defeating a weakened Delhi Daredevils side by 6 wickets, with figures of 2/17.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, their confidence was dented with two back-to-back defeats to the new look Kolkata Knight Riders in a span of three days. In the clash at Jaipur, they lost by 9 wickets courtesy a 100-run partnership between Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Whereas in Kolkata, Lakshmipathy Balaji picked 3/15 in 4 overs on a minefield pitch in Eden Gardens to help his team pull of an 8 wicket victory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan's task of making it into the last four much tougher. Shaun Marsh was in great nick and his 42-ball 71 resulted in the Royals losing to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali by 48 runs. However, they pulled together a string of a hat-trick of home wins, as Rajasthan chased successfully in all the three matches. The first was against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, winning by 8 wickets. Followed by Mumbai Indians, the No.1 team then on the points table as they chased down a total of 100 with 7 wickets to spare. And then the Pune Warriors India were undone by Ross Taylors 35-ball 47 not out, as Rajasthan won by 6 wickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again it was inconsistency which let the Royals down badly. They were given a proper thumping by the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings in both the matches they played against each other, within a span of five days. The in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore thrashed them by 9 wickets courtesy Chris Gayle while they were bowled out for 97 in their 8-wicket defeat to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough this time they ended their round robin matches well with a win against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai and in the process giving Shane Warne a fitting farewell, Rajasthan were dismissed from the competition since they ended at the 6th position out of the 10 teams in the tournament, having again won 6 out of their 14 matches played, with one being a no result.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals finished in seventh place among the point table in season 5 of IPL winning only seven matches out of sixteen.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the playoff stage by finishing third in the group stage, thus grabbing a spot in Champions League 2013. They won against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator but lost to Mumbai Indians in the second qualifier, which led to their exit from the tournament.[46][47] Shane Watson was declared the Man of the tournament.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 May 2013, three Rajasthan Royals players Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila were arrested from Mumbai by Delhi Police along with eleven bookies on charges of spot-fixing in the tournament. The fixing happened in the matches against Pune Warriors on 5 May, Kings XI Punjab on 9 May and Mumbai Indians on 15 May.[48] Later BCCI suspended the three players.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nRajasthan Royals retained five players ÿ Sanju Samson, Ajinkya Rahane, Shane Watson, James Faulkner and Stuart Binny ÿ for the seventh season of the IPL. Rajasthan Royals scored 65 runs off the last 17 balls at a strike rate of 382.35 to win the match against RCB.[50] Shane Watson lead the side and Rahul Dravid played the role of a mentor.[51][52]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2018, the Rajasthan Royals made a comeback to IPL after two years of suspension. Prior to the 2018 IPL auction, the Royals retained Steve Smith for ?12 crore (US$1.8?million) announcing him as captain for 2018 season.[53] Following the ball tampering controversy in March 2018, Smith stepped down as Royals captain with Ajinkya Rahane appointed. Smith was subsequently banned from playing in the 2018 IPL season.[54][55][56][57] Following Steve Smith's ban Heinrich Klaasen was announced as replacement.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 May 2018, in a match against the Delhi Daredevils, Jos Buttler scored the fastest ever 50 for Rajasthan Royals, off just 18 balls. This was also the fifth fastest in IPL history. However, RR lost the match by four runs after failing to make the revised target of 151 from 12 overs due to rain. Buttler also equalled Virender Sehwags record for most consecutive fifties in the IPL, with 5 consecutive fifties. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royals managed to secure fourth place in the regular season, with 14 points. However, they crashed out of the playoffs in the eliminator against Kolkata Knight Riders, losing by 25 runs in Eden Gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team anthem is 'Halla Bol'. In the first IPL season the song was sung by Ila Arun.[58] While in second season, it was sung by huudiya.[59]Currently, this team's anthem is 'Phir Halla Bol', released in 2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe team's mascot is a lion named Moochu Singh.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally, the Rajasthan Royals usually purchase cricketers who are not very famous, unknown or uncapped i.e. not played for their nation, at cut-throat prices. The Royals are famous for their frugal spending in the IPL auctions, even during the mega-auctions held once in 3 years. They have even bought players who had previously never played first-class cricket such as Dinesh Salunkhe and Pravin Tambe. The team has also purchased leading cricketers at various times in their history like Shane Warne, Graeme Smith, Rahul Dravid, Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, Munaf Patel, Mohammad Kaif, Shaun Tait, Ross Taylor, Justin Langer, Damien Martyn and Brad Hogg to name a few.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the cricketers who have played for the Royals, having been bought by them as relatively unknown players, have ended up as leading international cricketers partly due to their strong performances in the IPL and backing from the Royals management. In the initial seasons, such players included Taruwar Kohli, who was acquired by the franchise in 2008 under the Under-19 player quota and Yusuf Pathan, the elder brother of the Indian all-rounder Irfan Pathan and a relative unknown in cricketing circles unlike his more-celebrated younger brother. Yusuf's brilliant performances in the initial seasons of the IPL earned him a place in the Indian cricket team, and was a member of the Indian squad which won the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Even Australian Shane Watson, who has played for the Royals ever since its inception, became a permanent, consistent and leading member of the Australian cricket team soon after his brilliant first season with the Royals in 2008. In the later seasons, these players have included Indian cricketers such as Ajinkya Rahane, wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson, leg-spinner Tambe, whose performances for the Royals earned him a Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai at the age of 42,[60] Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni, as well as international cricketers like James Faulkner, Steve Smith and Tim Southee. Even off-spinner Ajit Chandila, who played only 2 first-class matches and was also convicted in the spot-fixing scandal, was one of the top bowlers for the Royals during the 2012 and 2013 seasons.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home venue of the Royals is the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. The stadium was built during the reign of Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II, who was also known as SMS, hence the name stadium. It is situated at one corner of the Rambagh Circle. The stadium seats 30,000 and is one of the best in India, after the 2006 renovation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in 2014, Sardar Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad hosted the Rajasthan Royals home matches.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\nSawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, is set to host Royals home games in 2018 IPL season after Rajasthan Royals were suspended for 2 years in 2015 and after Stadium is banned to host matches for 4 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n[63]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain: Shane Warne\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Royals won the inaugural DLF IPL T-20 Tournament on 1 June 2008.\\r\\nMoS ÿ  Shane Watson 472 runs and 17 wickets, Purple Cap Holder  Sohail Tanvir\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain?: Rahul Dravid\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain: Shane Watson\\r\\n\\r\\n?Ajinkya Rahane (2018-)","input":"Who was the first captain of rajasthan royals?"},{"output":"Aha ha","context":"Aha ha is a species of Australian wasp, named by the entomologist Arnold Menke in 1977 as a joke.

Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced during the AppleÿIntel transition, after the iMac. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently available in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. A 17-inch version was available between April 2006 and June 2012.\\r\\nThe first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4, but used Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.\\r\\nThe product's second iteration, known as the \\"unibody\\" model, has a casing made from a single piece of aluminum. It debuted in October 2008 in 13- and 15-inch screen sizes. In January 2009, the 17-inch model was updated with the same unibody design. Subsequent updates brought upgraded Intel Core i5 and i7 processors and introduced Intel's Thunderbolt technology.\\r\\nApple released the third generation of MacBook Pro with a 15-inch screen during WWDC 2012 and discontinued the 17-inch variant. The previous generation 13- and 15-inch unibody models continued to sell with updated processors. The third generation model was a quarter thinner than its predecessor and introduced the Retina Display with a much higher screen resolution. A 13-inch variant was released in October 2012.\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro was announced on October 27, 2016. It replaced the function keys with an interactive, multi-touch \\"Touch Bar\\" and a Touch ID sensor integrated into the Power button. The 15-inch notebook started at $2,399, compared to $1,999 for the previous iteration.[2] On 5 June 2017, Apple upgraded the internals of the MacBook Pro, such as enhanced Iris Plus and AMD Radeon graphics, Kaby Lake processors, and added memory. Additionally, the 13-inch MacBook Pro now comes with a 128GB storage option (down from the base 256GB storage) with a lowered starting price of $1299. All other configurations of the MacBook Pro have the same price as last year, barring the incremental upgrades in processors and graphics.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 15-inch MacBook Pro was announced on January 10, 2006 by Steve Jobs at the Macworld Conference & Expo.[4] The 17-inch model was unveiled on April 24, 2006.[5] The first design was largely a carryover from the PowerBook G4, but uses Intel Core CPUs instead of PowerPC G4 chips.[6] The 15-inch MacBook Pro weighs the same as the 15-inch aluminum PowerBook G4, but is 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) deeper, 0.4 inches (1.0?cm) wider, and 0.1 inches (0.25?cm) thinner.[7] Other changes from the PowerBook include a built-in iSight webcam and the inclusion of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector designed to detach easily when yanked. These features were later brought over to the MacBook. The optical drive was reduced in size in order to fit into the slimmer MacBook Pro, hence it runs slower than the optical drive in the PowerBook G4 and cannot write to dual layer DVDs.[6][8]\\r\\nBoth the original 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots found in the PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port,[9] while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports as well as one FireWire 400 port.[10] When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports,[7][9] although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision[11] and is present in every version of the 17-inch design.[10] S-Video capability can be attained through the use of a DVI to S-Video adapter.[7] External displays with up to a 2,560?G?1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port.[12] All models include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g.[9][10] Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n[13] and Bluetooth 2.1.\\r\\nApple refreshed the entire MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors.[11] Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1?GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2?GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models.[11] FireWire 800 was added to the 15-inch models. Hard drive capacity was increased, although video card options stayed the same.[11] The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options.[14][15] LED backlighting was added to the 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from 5.6 pounds (2.5?kg) to 5.4 pounds (2.4?kg).[15] Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667?MHz to 800?MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6?GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.[15]\\r\\nOn February 26, 2008, the MacBook Pro line was again updated.[16][17] LED backlighting was added as an option for the 17-inch model.[16] Processors were updated to \\"Penryn\\" cores, which are built on the 45 nanometer process (65 nanometer \\"Merom\\" cores were previously used), and hard drive and memory capacities were increased.[16] Multi-touch capabilities, first introduced with the MacBook Air earlier that year, were brought over to the MacBook Pro's trackpad.[16] When the 15-inch unibody MacBook Pro was introduced on October 14, 2008, the pre-unibody model with the same screen size was discontinued, while the 17-inch pre-unibody model continued to be sold.[18] The original case design was discontinued on January 6, 2009, when the 17-inch MacBook Pro was also updated with unibody construction.[19]\\r\\nSome reviewers applauded the MacBook Pro for its doubling or tripling the speed of the PowerBook G4 in some areas.[6] For example, the 3D rendering program Cinema 4D XL was 3.3?times as fast (2.3 times faster),[6] and its boot-up time was more than twice as quick.[7] The MacBook Pro generally outperformed the PowerBook G4 in performance analyzer utility tests XBench and Cinebench.[7] Reviewers lauded the screen's maximum brightness, 67?percent higher than the PowerBook G4; the excellent horizontal viewing angles; the matte options; and the bright, crisp, and true colors.[8] Although the screen offered fewer vertical pixels (1,440?G?900 in the MacBook Pro instead of 1,440?G?960 in the PowerBook), one reviewer called the screen \\"nothing less than stellar\\".[7] Reviewers praised the new MagSafe power adapter,[6] although one reviewer said it disconnected too easily in some instances.[7] They also praised the backlit keyboard, large trackpad, and the virtually silent operation of the machine.[6][8] The new laptop also offered better wireless performance.\\r\\nOne reviewer criticized the decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 graphics card by about 30?percent its original speed.[8] The notebook was also noted for running hot.[6][8] Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks.[7] Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models.[7] Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings.[7] Apple increased the battery capacity by 10?Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60,[7] but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power.[7] Battery life therefore remained about the same as in previous models, at three-plus hours.[7]\\r\\nSuperDrive: 8G DVD-DL discs reads. 4G DVD+/-R & RW recording. 24G CD-R and 10G CD-RW recording\\r\\n(optional for 15-inch)\\r\\nSuperDrive: 4G DVD+R writes, 8G DVD+/-R read, 4G DVD+/-RW writes, 24G CD-R, and 10G CD-RW recording (17-inch)\\r\\nOn October 14, 2008, in a press event at company headquarters, Apple officials announced a new 15-inch MacBook Pro featuring a \\"precision aluminum unibody enclosure\\" and tapered sides similar to those of the MacBook Air.[30][31] Designers shifted the MacBook Pro's ports to the left side of the case, and moved the optical disc drive slot from the front to the right side, similar to the MacBook. The new MacBook Pros had two video cards, which the user could switch between: the Nvidia GeForce 9600M GT with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory and a GeForce 9400M with 256?MB of shared system memory.[30] Although the FireWire 400 port was removed, the FireWire 800 port was retained. The DVI port was replaced with a Mini DisplayPort receptacle.[30] The original unibody MacBook Pro came with a user-removable battery; Apple claimed five hours of use,[30] with one reviewer reporting results closer to four on a continuous video battery stress test.[32] Apple said that the battery would hold 80?percent of its charge after 300 recharges.[33]\\r\\nThe unibody-construction MacBook Pro largely follows the styling of the original aluminum iMac and the MacBook Air and is slightly thinner than its predecessor, albeit wider and deeper due to the widescreen display.[30] The screen is high-gloss, covered by an edge-to-edge reflective glass finish, while an anti-glare matte option is available in the 15- and 17-inch models in which the glass panel is removed.[34] The entire trackpad is usable and acts as a clickable button.[34] The trackpad is also larger than the first generation model's, giving more room for scrolling and multi-touch gestures.[34] When the line was updated in April 2010, inertial scrolling was added, making the scrolling experience much like that of the iPhone and iPad.[35][36][37] The keys, still backlit, are now that of Apple's now-standard sunken keyboard with separated black keys.[35]\\r\\nDuring the MacWorld Expo keynote on January 6, 2009, Phil Schiller announced a 17-inch MacBook Pro with unibody construction. This version diverged from its 15-inch sibling with an anti-glare \\"matte\\" screen option (with the glossy finish standard) and a non user-removable lithium polymer battery.[38] Instead of traditional round cells inside the casing, the lithium-ion polymer batteries are shaped and fitted into each laptop to maximally utilize space. Adaptive charging, which uses a chip to optimize the charge flow to reduce wear and tear, extends the battery's overall life.[38] Battery life for the 17\\" version is quoted at eight hours, with 80?percent of this charge remaining after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles.[38]\\r\\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 8, 2009, it was announced that the 13-inch unibody MacBook would be upgraded and re-branded as a MacBook Pro,[39] leaving only the white polycarbonate MacBook in the MacBook line.[40] It was also announced that the entire MacBook Pro line would use the non user-removable battery first introduced in the 17-inch MacBook Pro.[41] The updated MacBook Pro 13- and the 15-inch would each have up to a claimed seven hours of battery life, while the 17-inch would keep its eight-hour capacity.[39][41] Some sources even reported up to eight hours of battery life for the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros during casual use,[42] while others reported around six hours.[34] Like the 17-inch MacBook Pro, Apple claims that they will last around 1,000 charge cycles while still containing 80?percent of their capacity.[43] Graphics card options stayed the same from the previous release, although the 13-inch[44] and the base model 15-inch, came with only the GeForce 9400M GPU.[45] The screens were also improved, gaining a claimed 60?percent greater color gamut.[44][45] All of these mid 2009 models also included a FireWire 800 port and all except the 17-inch models would receive an SD card slot.[31] The 17-inch model would retain its ExpressCard/34 slot.[41] For the 13-inch MacBook Pro, the Kensington lock slot was moved to the right side of the chassis.[46] In August 2009, Apple extended the \\"matte\\" anti-glare display option to the 15-inch MacBook Pro.[47]\\r\\nOn April 13, 2010,[48] Intel Core i5 and Core i7 CPUs were introduced in the 15- and 17-inch models, while the 13-inch retained the Core 2 Duo with a speed increase.[48] The power brick was redesigned[35] and a high-resolution display (of 1,680?G?1,050) was announced as an option for the 15-inch models.[36] The 13-inch gained an integrated Nvidia GeForce 320M graphics processing unit (GPU) with 256?MB of shared memory, while the 15- and 17-inch models were upgraded to the GeForce GT 330M, with either 256 or 512?MB of dedicated memory.[48] The 15- and 17-inch models also have an integrated Intel GPU that is built into the Core i5 and i7 processors.[48] The 15-inch model also gained 0.1 pounds (0.045?kg).[36] Save for a third USB 2.0 slot, all the ports on the 17-inch MacBook Pro are the same in type and number as on the 15-inch version.[49] All models come with 4?GB of system memory that is upgradeable to 8?GB.[48] Battery life was also extended further in this update, to an estimated ten hours for the 13-inch and 8ÿ9 hours on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros.[48] This was achieved through both greater power efficiency and adding more battery capacity.[48] One reviewer reported about six hours of battery life through a continuous video battery stress test in the 15-inch[37] and another, who called the battery life \\"unbeatable,\\" reported nearer to eight in the 13-inch through their \\"highly demanding battery drain test\\".[35]\\r\\nThunderbolt technology, Sandy Bridge dual core Intel Core i5 and i7 (on the 13-inch model) or quad-core i7 (on the 15- and 17-inch models) processors, and a high definition FaceTime camera were added on February 24, 2011. Intel HD Graphics 3000 come integrated with the CPU, while the 15- and 17-inch models also utilize AMD Radeon HD 6490M and Radeon HD 6750M graphics cards. Later editions of these models, following the release of OS X Lion, replaced the dashboard (F4) key with a launchpad key. The chassis bottoms are also engraved differently from the 2010 models.[50] The Thunderbolt serial bus platform can achieve speeds of up to 10?Gbit/s,[51] which is up to twice as fast as the USB 3.0 specification, 20 times faster than the USB 2.0 specification, and up to 12 times faster than FireWire 800.[52] Apple says that Thunderbolt can be used to drive displays or to transfer large quantities of data in a short amount of time.[52]\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its upgraded Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco.[53] The new MacBook Pro models were updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB.[54] Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros except for the entry-level 2.5?GHz 13-inch model.[55] Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apples only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard disk drive and Ethernet port.[56]\\r\\nSome reviewers praised the new laptop's performance and compact size,[32] the quality of the screen, and sturdy unibody build,[32] which allowed easier upgrading of internal components as compared to the original models.[32] Some reviewers also noted that the new MacBook Pro ran more quietly and at cooler temperatures than first generation machines.[32] Others, however, criticized the amount of heat generated by the new design.[57][58]\\r\\nReviewers lamented the loss of a matte screen option for the 2008 unibody MacBook Pro, noting the reflectiveness of the screen in sunlight, even when its brightness was turned all the way up.[32] CNET's Dan Ackerman commented of the mid-2009 models: \\"According to Apple, the new display offers a wider color gamut, and the screen certainly looks bright and colorful, but we wish the same matte-screen option offered on the 17-inch MacBook Pro was available across the line... While the LED screen means a thinner lid and some battery life benefits, the edge-to-edge glass covering the entire display panel grabs stray light rays with ease, making the glossy screen hard to see in some lighting conditions.\\"[34] By 2011, matte screens were offered for both the 15\\" and 17\\" models. Furthermore, the addition of Mini DisplayPort instead of the more popular HDMI was criticized.[32] The relatively low number of ports and lower end technical specifications when compared to similarly priced laptops from other brands were also bemoaned.[32]\\r\\nLaptop Magazine's Michael Prospero praised the 2010 15-inch model's display, calling it \\"bright and crisp\\". He further commented, \\"While reflections from the glossy display weren't overwhelming, it's also nice to know there's an antiglare optionthough only for the higher resolution display. Still, colors were bright, blacks were deep and dark, and viewing angles were excellent both vertically and horizontally.\\" He also lauded the quality of the iSight webcam, the responsiveness of the touchpad, the microphone and speakers, as well as the performance of the new CPUs for the 15\\" model and the long battery life. Complaints included the price of the laptop, the low number of USB ports, and the lack of HDMI.[36]\\r\\nCNET praised the automatic graphics switching features of the 15- and 17-inch 2010 models as well as the graphics cards themselves. Acclaim was also given to the Core i5 and i7 CPUs, the multi-touch trackpad, and the addition of audio capabilities to the Mini DisplayPort video output.[37] They also called for the addition of HDMI and the Blu-ray optical disc format, saying that most other computers in the MacBook Pro's price range possessed these features.[37] CNET also criticized the option of a higher resolution screen in the 15-inch model, saying that \\"the higher-resolution screen should be included by default.\\"[37]\\r\\n2.53?GHz (T9400) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (T9600) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\n2.8?GHz (T9600) (15\\" and 17\\" only) Intel Core 2 Duo Penryn with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.06?GHz (T9900) with 6?MB on-chip L2 cache (15\\" and 17\\" only)\\r\\nSince the RAM and the hard drive on some generations of MacBook Pro are user serviceable parts, there are aftermarket modifications to enhance the system with up to 16GB of DDR3-1600 RAM (maximum capacity and frequency depend on the hardware in question), 7200-rpm hard drives or third party SSDs.\\r\\nEarly and Late 2011 models reportedly suffer from manufacturing problems leading to overheating, graphical issues, and eventually complete GPU and logic board failure. A thread was opened on the Apple Support community[89] that reached more than 12,000 posts and 4,000,000 visits (Feb 2015). A similar but nonidentical issue affected iMac GPUs which were later recalled by Apple.[90] The problem was covered by many articles in Mac-focused magazines, starting late 2013 throughout 2014.[91][92][93][94][95] In August 2014 the law firm Whitfield Bryson & Mason LLP had begun investigating the problem to determine if any legal claim exists.[96] On October 28, 2014, the firm announced that it has filed a class-action lawsuit in a California federal court against Apple. The lawsuit will cover residents residing in both California and Florida who have purchased a 2011 MacBook Pro notebook with an AMD graphics card. The firm is also investigating similar cases across the United States.[97] On February 20, 2015, Apple instituted the \\"MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues\\".? This \\"will repair affected MacBook Pro systems, free of charge.\\"\\r\\nOn June 11, 2012 at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, Apple introduced the third generation MacBook Pro, marketed as the \\"MacBook Pro with Retina display\\" to differentiate it from the predecessor model.[53] The new model includes Intel's third generation Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge microarchitecture), USB 3.0, and a high-resolution 15.4\\" IPS 2880G1800-pixel Retina Display.[54] Other new or changed features include a second Thunderbolt port, a HDMI port, and a thinner MagSafe port, dubbed the \\"MagSafe 2\\".[98] Apple introduced a 13-inch version on October 23, 2012 with specifications similar but slightly inferior to the 15-inch version's, such as less powerful processors.[99]\\r\\nThe new models omit Ethernet and FireWire 800 ports, though Apple offers Thunderbolt adapters for both interfaces.[100] They also omit a SuperDrive, making the 15-inch model Apple's first professional notebook since the PowerBook 2400c to ship without a built-in optical drive.[101] Instead of a hard disk drive, the new models ship with a solid state drive housed in a proprietary flash module design rather than a 2.5\\" notebook drive. Apple also claims improved speakers and microphones and a new system for cooling the notebook with improved fans.[98] The new case design does not have a Kensington lock slot, so alternative products are required to physically secure the computer.[102]\\r\\nThe Retina models also have fewer user-accessible upgrade or replacement options than previous MacBooks. Unlike in previous generations, the memory is soldered onto the logic board and is therefore not upgradable. The solid state drive is not soldered and can be replaced by users.[103] The battery is glued into place; attempts to remove it may destroy the battery and/or trackpad.[104] The entire case uses proprietary pentalobe screws and cannot be disassembled with standard tools. While the battery is glued in, recycling companies have stated that the design is only \\"mildly inconvenient\\" and does not hamper the recycling process.[105]\\r\\nOn February 13, 2013, Apple announced updated prices and processors for the MacBook Pro with Retina Display and increased the RAM of the high-end 15-inch model to 16 GB.[106]\\r\\nOn October 22, 2013, Apple updated the line with Intel's Haswell processors and Iris Graphics, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Thunderbolt 2, and PCIe-based flash storage.[107] The chassis of the 13-inch version was slightly slimmed to 0.71 inches (18?mm) to match the 15-inch model. The lower-end 15-inch model only included integrated graphics while the higher-end model continued to include a discrete Nvidia graphics card in addition to integrated graphics.[108] Support for 4K video output via HDMI was added but limited the maximum number of external displays from three to two.[109] On July 29, 2014 Apple announced updated prices and processors for the Haswell MacBook Pro with Retina Display.[110]\\r\\nOn March 9, 2015, the 13-inch model was updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, increased battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad.[111][112] On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete graphics card on the higher-end model.[113][114] The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120G2880 displays.[115] The 15-inch models were released with the same Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.[116]\\r\\nThe Retina Display MacBook Pro largely follows the design of the previous generation with its aluminum enclosure and separated black keys. The most apparent body changes are a thinner chassis and a display with a redesigned hinge and thinner bezel and the removal of the internal optical drive. The power button is moved from the upper right corner of the chassis onto the keyboard, taking the place of the optical disc eject button.[117] At 0.71 inches (18?mm) thick, the 15-inch model is 25?percent thinner than its predecessor. The model name is no longer placed at the bottom of the screen bezel; instead, it is found on the underside of the chassis, similar to an iOS device. It is the first Macintosh laptop to not have its model name visible during normal use, as every prior laptop had its model name on the screen bezel or keyboard.[118]\\r\\nThe third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display, flash storage and power. It was criticized, however, for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive. Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was \\"groundbreaking\\" and made people \\"rethink how they use technology.\\" He praised the inclusion of USB 3.0 and the slimmer body.[119] Dan Ackerman of CNET commented \\"I've previously called the 15-inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all-around laptops you can buy. This new version adds to that with HDMI, faster ports, and more portability. But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port, plus its very high starting price. The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users, and with the exception of all-day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook, one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy.\\"[120]\\r\\nJoel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine gave the MacBook Pro an \\"Editor's Choice\\" rating. He praised its \\"brilliant Retina display,\\" the thin design, port selection and speedy storage, and highlighted the expandability via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each.[121] David Pogue of The New York Times praised the 15-inch model's screen, keyboard, sound, start-up time, cosmetics, battery life, storage, and RAM capacity. They criticized the lack of a SuperDrive, pricing, and the MagSafe 2 power connector's lack of backwards compatibility with the older MagSafe design.[122]\\r\\nSince the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling (an EPEAT requirement), Apple received criticisms about the machine's ability to be recycled. Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple \\"has pitted design against the environmentand chosen design. They're making a big bet that people don't care, but recycling is a big issue.\\"[123] Wired also criticized Apple's recyclability claims, stating \\"[t]he design may well be comprised of 'highly recyclable aluminum and glass'but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they have no way of recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad.\\"[124]\\r\\nThe Retina Display on the MacBook Pro have been criticized for \\"image retention,\\" specifically for displays manufactured by LG.[125][126]\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-3720QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3820QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i7-3520M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge processor with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-3540M) dual-core Intel Core i7 Ivy Bridge with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i5-4288U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4558U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i5-4308U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.0?GHz (i7-4578U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Haswell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.9?GHz (i5-5287U) dual-core Intel Core i5 Broadwell with 3?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 3.1?GHz (i7-5557U) dual-core Intel Core i7 Broadwell with 4?MB shared L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.7?GHz (i7-3740QM) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-3840QM) with 8?MB on-chip L3 cache\\r\\nOptional 2.3?GHz (i7-4850HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.6?GHz (i7-4960HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.5?GHz (i7-4870HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nOptional 2.8?GHz (i7-4980HQ) with 6?MB on-chip L3 cache and 128?MB L4 cache (Crystalwell)\\r\\nApple unveiled fourth generation 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro models during a press event at their headquarters on October 27, 2016. The models introduced the Touch Bar, a multi-touch enabled OLED strip built into the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. They include a sapphire-glass covered Touch ID sensor at the right end of the Touch Bar which doubles as a power button. The models also introduce a \\"second-generation\\" butterfly mechanism keyboard that provided more travel than the first iteration implemented on the Retina MacBook. The 13-inch model has a trackpad that is 46% larger than its predecessor while the 15-inch model has a trackpad twice as large as the prior generation.\\r\\nAll ports have been replaced with either two or four combination USB-C 3.1 ports that support Thunderbolt 3 and dual DisplayPort 1.2 signals,[138] any of which can be used for charging.[139] The MacBook Pro is incompatible with some older Thunderbolt 3 certified peripherals,[140][141] including Intels own reference design for Thunderbolt 3 devices.[142] Furthermore, MacOS on MacBook Pro blocks certain classes of Thunderbolt 3 compatible devices from working by blacklisting them.[143] Devices using HDMI, previous generation Thunderbolt, and USB will require an adapter to connect to the MacBook Pro.[139][144][145] The models come with a 3.5mm headphone jack, although TOSLINK functionality of older generation MacBook Pros has been removed.\\r\\nOther updates to the MacBook Pro include dual and quad-core Intel \\"Skylake\\" Core i5 and i7 processors, improved graphics, and displays that offer a 25% wider color gamut, 67% more brightness, and 67% more contrast. All versions are able to output to a 5K display, with the 15-inch models capable of two. The 15-inch models include a discrete Radeon Pro 450, 455 or 460 graphics card in addition to the integrated Intel graphics. Additionally, Apple introduced a cheaper lower-end 13-inch model which lacks the Touch Bar in favor of function keys, and has only two USB-C ports. The flash storage in the Touch Bar models is soldered to the logic board and is not upgradeable, while in the 13-inch model without Touch Bar, it is removable.[146][147]\\r\\nThe fourth generation MacBook Pro follows the design of the previous two generations with an all-metal unibody enclosure and separated black keys. A few apparent design changes are a thinner chassis, thinner screen bezel, larger trackpad, the OLED Touch Bar, and shallower butterfly mechanism keyboard with less key separation than the previous models. The speakers grilles have been relocated to the sides of the keyboard on the 13-inch variant. Tear downs show that the speaker grilles on the 13-inch model with Touch Bar are \\"largely cosmetic\\", and that sound output mostly comes through the side vents.[148] The fourth generation MacBook Pro comes in two finishes, the traditional silver color and a darker \\"space gray\\" color. The MacBook Pro model name returns to the bottom of the screen bezel in Apple's San Francisco font after being absent from the third generation. Similar to the Retina MacBook, the new models replace the backlit Apple logo on the rear of the screen with a glossy opaque version.\\r\\nMagSafe, a magnetic charging connector, has been replaced with USB-C charging.[139] Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the users field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power.[139] The Macintosh startup chime that has been used since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.[139]\\r\\nThe 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reviews. Ars Technica noted that the keyboard was a \\"drastic departure\\" from previous MacBook Pro keyboards, being a second-generation version of the keyboard used in the Retina MacBook. It further noted that resting palms may brush the trackpad occasionally causing inadvertent cursor jumps onscreen as the laptop interprets this as input, without one's hands or wrists actually resting on it.[139] Also noted was an increase of bandwidth and approximately 40 percent increased read speed of the flash storage.[139] Engadget praised the thinner, lighter design, improved display and audio, and increased speed of the graphics and flash storage, but criticized the lack of ports and price.[149] Wired praised the display, calling it \\"the best laptop display I've ever seen\\", as well as praising the Touch Bar, though it criticized the need of adapters for many common connectors.[150] Likewise, The Verge concluded that \\"using [the new MacBook] is alienating to anyone living in the present. I agree with Apple's vision of the future. I'm just not buying it today.\\"[151]\\r\\nOther well-known review outlets, like Engadget, voiced their concerns over Apple \\"by doing things like removing full-sized USB ports, the memory card reader and even the Function row, Apple seems to forgotten how many of us actually work\\"[152]. This goes unison with the wider blogosphere and review scene where foremost the touch bar was criticized for providing a negative impact on a user's concentration and usability: \\"The?cognitive footprint?of?direct?second screen interactions is?significantly higher than that of?indirect?interactions[153]\\". Other items of critique frequently where non-compatibility between Thunderbolt 2 and 3 devices, frequently unpleasant fan whine noises[154] in idle CPU states on the larger screen (15\\") models were reported, where the two integrated fans run all the time by default. Responsible for this behaviour are the Co-Processor powering the touch bar and higher TDP of the stronger CPU models.\\r\\nThe battery life of the new models also received mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent battery life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on battery by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update.[155][156] Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.[157][158]\\r\\niFixit gave the models their lowest possible score of 1 out of 10 for repairability, noting that memory, the processor, and flash storage are soldered to the logic board, while the battery is glued to the case.

EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers,[178] but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software.[77][179] Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.[180] This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI.[181][182]\\r\\nAs the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform from earlier PowerPC (PPC)-based Macintoshes, versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator, which exacts some performance penalty, cannot emulate some lower-level PPC code, and does not support 64-bit (G5 specific) PPC features.[183] Rosetta is not present in Lion and later, so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.[184]","input":"When was the most recent macbook pro released?"},{"output":"August 24, 1814","context":"The Burning of Washington was a British attack against Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, during the War of 1812. On August 24, 1814, after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, a British force led by Major General Robert Ross occupied Washington and set fire to many public buildings, including the White House (known as the Presidential Mansion), and the Capitol, as well as other facilities of the U.S. government.[2] The attack was in part a retaliation for the recent American destruction of Port Dover in Upper Canada. It marks the only time in U.S. history that Washington, D.C. has been occupied by a foreign force.\\r\\nPresident James Madison, military officials, and his government fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the \\"United States Capital for a Day.\\" President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.\\r\\nLess than a day after the attack began, a sudden, very heavy thunderstormpossibly a hurricaneput out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away, killing British troops and American civilians alike. Following the storm, the British returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. The occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. After the \\"Storm that saved Washington\\", as it soon came to be called, the Americans were able to regain control of the city.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British government, already at war with Napoleonic France, adopted a defensive strategy against the United States when the Americans declared war in 1812. Reinforcements were held back from Canada and reliance was instead made on local militias and native allies to bolster the British Army in Canada. However, after the defeat and exile of Napoleon Bonaparte in April 1814, Britain was able to use its now available troops and ships to prosecute its war with the United States. In addition to reinforcements sent to Canada, the Earl of Bathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, dispatched an army brigade and additional naval vessels to Bermuda, from where a blockade of the US coast and even the occupation of some coastal islands had been overseen throughout the war. It was decided to use these forces in raids along the Atlantic seaboard to draw American forces away from Canada.[4] The commanders were under strict orders, however, not to carry out operations far inland, or to attempt to hold territory. Early in 1814, Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane had been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's North America and West Indies Station, controlling naval forces based at the new Bermuda dockyard and the Halifax Naval Yard which were used to blockade US Atlantic ports throughout the war. He planned to carry the war into the United States by attacks in Virginia and against New Orleans.[5]\\r\\nRear Admiral George Cockburn had commanded the squadron in Chesapeake Bay since the previous year. On June 25 he wrote to Cochrane, stressing that the defenses there were weak, and he felt that several major cities were vulnerable to attack.[6] Cochrane suggested attacking Baltimore, Washington and Philadelphia. On July 17, Cockburn recommended Washington as the target, because of the comparative ease of attacking the national capital and \\"the greater political effect likely to result\\".[7] General Ross commanded a 4,500-man army, comprised of the 4th (King's Own) Light, 21st Royal North British Fusiliers, 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, and 85th Regiment of Foot.\\r\\nAn added motive was retaliation for what Britain saw as the \\"wanton destruction of private property along the north shores of Lake Erie\\" by American forces under Col. John Campbell in May 1814, the most notable being the Raid on Port Dover.[8] On June 2, 1814, Sir George Prvost, Governor General of The Canadas, wrote to Cochrane at Admiralty House, in Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, calling for a retaliation against the American destruction of private property in violation of the laws of war. Prvost argued that,\\r\\n in consequence of the late disgraceful conduct of the American troops in the wanton destruction of private property on the north shores of Lake Erie, in order that if the war with the United States continues you may, should you judge it advisable, assist in inflicting that measure of retaliation which shall deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages.[8]\\r\\nOn July 18, Cochrane ordered Cockburn that to \\"deter the enemy from a repetition of similar outrages....You are hereby required and directed to destroy and lay waste such towns and districts as you may find assailable\\".[9] Cochrane instructed, \\"You will spare merely the lives of the unarmed inhabitants of the United States\\". Ross and Cockburn surveyed the torching of the President's Mansion, during which time a great storm arose unexpectedly out of the southeast. They were confronted a number of times while on horseback by older women from around Washington City and elderly clergymen (Southern Presbyterian and Southern Baptist), with women and children who had been hiding in homes and churches. They requested protection from abuse and robbery by enlisted personnel from the British Expeditionary Forces whom they accused of having tried to ransack private homes and other buildings. Major-General Ross had two British soldiers put in chains for violation of his general order. Throughout the events of that day, a severe storm blew into the city, worsening on the night of August 24, 1814.\\r\\nPresident James Madison, members of his government, and the military fled the city in the wake of the British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg. They eventually found refuge for the night in Brookeville, a small town in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is known today as the United States Capital for a Day. President Madison spent the night in the house of Caleb Bentley, a Quaker who lived and worked in Brookeville. Bentley's house, known today as the Madison House, still stands in Brookeville.[10]\\r\\nThe sappers and miners of the Corps of Royal Engineers under Captain Blanshard were employed in burning the principal buildings. Blanshard reported that it seemed that the American President was so sure that the attacking force would be made prisoners that a handsome entertainment had been prepared. Blanshard and his sappers enjoyed the feast.[11]:358\\r\\nThe Capitol was, according to some contemporary travelers, the only building in Washington \\"worthy to be noticed.\\"[12] Thus, it was a prime target for the invaders, both for its aesthetic and symbolic value. After looting the building, the British found it difficult to set the structure on fire, owing to its sturdy stone construction. Soldiers eventually gathered furniture into a heap and ignited it with rocket powder, which successfully set the building ablaze. Among the casualties of the destruction of the Capitol was the Library of Congress, the entire 3,000 volume collection of which was destroyed.[13] Several surrounding buildings in Capitol Heights also caught fire. After the war, Thomas Jefferson sold his own personal library to the government in order to pay personal debts, re-establishing the Library of Congress.\\r\\nAfter burning the Capitol, the British turned northwest up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House. After US government officials and President Madison fled the city, the First Lady Dolley Madison received a letter from her husband, urging her to be prepared to leave Washington at a moment's notice.[14] Dolley organized the slaves and staff to save valuables from the British.[15] James Madison's personal slave, the fifteen-year-old boy Paul Jennings, was an eyewitness.[16] After later buying his freedom from the widow Dolley Madison, Jennings published his memoir in 1865, considered the first from the White House:\\r\\nIt has often been stated in print, that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the White House, she cut out from the frame the large portrait of Washington (now in one of the parlors there), and carried it off. She had no time for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down. All she carried off was the silver in her reticule, as the British were thought to be but a few squares off, and were expected any moment.[17]\\r\\nJennings said the people who saved the painting and removed the objects actually were:\\r\\nJohn Sus (Jean Pierre Sioussat) (a Frenchman, then door-keeper, and still living) and Magraw [McGraw], the President's gardener, took it down and sent it off on a wagon, with some large silver urns and such other valuables as could be hastily got hold of. When the British did arrive, they ate up the very dinner, and drank the wines, &c., that I had prepared for the President's party.[17][18][19]\\r\\nThe soldiers burned the president's house, and fuel was added to the fires that night to ensure they would continue burning into the next day.\\r\\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama held a ceremony at the White House to honor Jennings as a representative of his contributions to saving the Gilbert Stuart painting and other valuables. [According to recorded history of this event, the painting that was saved was a copy of the Gilbert Stuart painting, NOT the original][20] \\"A dozen descendants of Jennings came to Washington, to visit the White House. They looked at the painting their relative helped save.\\"[21] In an interview with National Public Radio, Jennings' great-great-grandson Hugh Alexander said, \\"We were able to take a family portrait in front of the painting, which was for me one of the high points.\\"[16] He confirmed that Jennings later purchased his freedom from the widowed Dolley Madison.[16]\\r\\nThe day after the destruction of the White House, Rear Admiral Cockburn entered the building of the D.C. newspaper, the National Intelligencer, intending to burn it down. However, several women persuaded him not to because they were afraid the fire would spread to their neighboring houses. Cockburn wanted to destroy the newspaper because its reporters had written so negatively about him, branding him \\"The Ruffian.\\" Instead, he ordered his troops to tear the building down brick by brick, and ordered all the \\"C\\" type destroyed \\"so that the rascals can have no further means of abusing my name.\\"[22]\\r\\nThe British sought out the United States Treasury in hopes of finding money or items of worth, but they found only old records.[23] They burned the United States Treasury and other public buildings. The United States Department of War building was also burned. However, the War and State Department files had been removed, so all books and records had been saved; the only records of the War Department lost were recommendations of appointments for the Army and letters received from seven years earlier.[24] The First U.S. Patent Office Building was saved by the efforts of William Thornton, the former Architect of the Capitol and then the Superintendent of Patents, who gained British cooperation to preserve it.[25][A] \\"When the smoke cleared from the dreadful attack, the Patent Office was the only Government building . . . left untouched\\" in Washington.[26]\\r\\nThe Americans had already burned much of the historic Washington Navy Yard, founded by Thomas Jefferson, to prevent capture of stores and ammunition,[27] as well as the 44-gun frigate USS Columbia and the 18 gun USS Argus both new vessels nearing completion.[28] The Navy Yard's Latrobe Gate, Quarters A, and Quarters B were the only buildings to escape destruction.[29][30] Also spared were the Marine Barracks and Commandant's House, although several private properties were damaged or destroyed.[31]\\r\\nIn the afternoon of August 25, General Ross sent two hundred men to secure a fort on Greenleaf's Point. The fort, later known as Fort McNair, had already been destroyed by the Americans, but 150 barrels of gunpowder remained. While the British were trying to destroy it by dropping the barrels into a well, the powder ignited. As many as thirty men were killed in the explosion, and many others were maimed.[32]\\r\\nLess than a day after the attack began, a sudden very heavy thunderstormpossibly a hurricaneput out the fires. It also spun off a tornado that passed through the center of the capital, setting down on Constitution Avenue[3] and lifting two cannons before dropping them several yards away and killing British troops and American civilians alike.[33] Following the storm, the British troops returned to their ships, many of which were badly damaged. There is some debate regarding the effect of this storm on the occupation. While some assert that the storm forced their retreat,[3] it seems likely from their destructive and arsonous actions before the storm, and their written orders from Cochrane to \\"destroy and lay waste\\",[34] that their intention was merely to raze the city, rather than occupy it for an extended period. Whatever the case, the British occupation of Washington lasted only about 26 hours. Despite this, the \\"Storm that saved Washington\\" as it became known, did the opposite according to some. The rains sizzled and cracked the already charred walls of the White House and ripped away at structures the British had no plans to destroy (such as the Patent Office). The storm may have exacerbated an already dire situation for Washington DC.\\r\\nAn encounter was noted between Sir George Cockburn 10th Baronet and a female resident of Washington. \\"Dear God! Is this the weather to which you are accustomed to in this infernal country?\\" enquired the Admiral. \\"This is a special interposition of Providence to drive our enemies from our city, the woman allegedly called out to Cockburn. \\"Not so, Madam,\\" Cockburn retorted. It is rather to aid your enemies in the destruction of your city\\", before riding off on horseback.[35] Yet, the British left right after the storm completely unopposed by any American military forces.\\r\\nThe Royal Navy reported that it lost one man killed and six wounded in the attack, of whom the fatality and three of the wounded were from the Corps of Colonial Marines.[36]\\r\\nThe destruction of the Capitol, including the Senate House and the House of Representatives, the Arsenal, Dockyard, Treasury, War Office, President's mansion, bridge over the Potomac, a frigate and a sloop together with all Materiel was estimated at S365,000.[11]:359\\r\\nA separate British force captured Alexandria, on the south side of the Potomac River, while Ross's troops were leaving Washington. The mayor of Alexandria made a deal and the British refrained from burning the town.[37]\\r\\nPresident Madison returned to Washington by September 1, on which date he issued a proclamation calling on citizens to defend the District of Columbia.[38] Congress returned and assembled in special session on September 19. Due to the destruction of the Capitol and other public buildings, they initially met in the Post and Patent Office building.[39]\\r\\nIn 2013, an episode of the Weather Channel documentary series \\"Weather That Changed History,\\" entitled \\"The Thunderstorm That Saved D.C.,\\" was devoted to these events.\\r\\nMost contemporary American observers, including newspapers representing anti-war Federalists, condemned the destruction of the public buildings as needless vandalism.[40] Many of the British public were shocked by the burning of the Capitol and other buildings at Washington; such actions were denounced by most leaders of continental Europe, where capital cities had been repeatedly occupied in the course of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars and always spared destruction (at least on the part of the occupiers - the famous burning of Moscow that occurred less than two years prior had been an act carried out by the defenders). According to The Annual Register, the burning had \\"brought a heavy censure on the British character,\\" with some members of Parliament, including the anti-establishment MP Samuel Whitbread,[40] joining in the criticism.\\r\\nThe majority of British opinion believed that the burnings were justified following the damage that United States forces had done with its incursions into Canada. In addition, they noted that the United States had been the aggressor, declaring war and initiating it.[41] Several commentators regarded the damages as just revenge for the American destruction of the Parliament buildings and other public buildings in York, the provincial capital of Upper Canada, early in 1813. Sir George Prvost wrote that \\"as a just retribution, the proud capital at Washington has experienced a similar fate.\\"[42] The Reverend John Strachan, who as Rector of York had witnessed the American acts there, wrote to Thomas Jefferson that the damage to Washington \\"was a small retaliation after redress had been refused for burnings and depredations, not only of public but private property, committed by them in Canada.\\"[43]\\r\\nWhen they ultimately returned to Bermuda, the British forces took two pairs of portraits of King George III and his wife, Queen Charlotte, which had been discovered in one of the public buildings. One pair currently hangs in the House of Assembly of the Parliament of Bermuda, and the other in the Cabinet Building, both in the city of Hamilton.[44]\\r\\nThe thick sandstone walls of the White House and Capitol survived, although scarred with smoke and scorch marks. There was a strong movement in Congress to relocate the nation's capital with many northern Congressmen pushing for a city north of the MasonÿDixon line. Philadelphia was quick to volunteer as a temporary home as did Georgetown, where Mayor Thomas Corcoran offered Georgetown College as a temporary home for Congress. Ultimately, a bill to relocate the capital was defeated in Congress and Washington remained the seat of government.\\r\\nFearful that there might be pressure to relocate the capital altogether, Washington businessmen financed the construction of the Old Brick Capitol, where Congress met while the Capitol was reconstructed from 1815 to 1819. Madison resided in The Octagon House for the remainder of his term. Reconstruction of the White House began in early 1815 and was finished in time for President James Monroe's inauguration in 1817.[45]\\r\\nAs American settlement expanded westward, serious proposals to relocate the capital to a location in the interior that would not be vulnerable to seaborne attack continued to be made from time to time. It was only following the emergence of the United States Navy as a force capable of rivalling the most powerful European navies that relocation of the capital would no longer be proposed at the Congressional level.\\r\\nIn the 2009 comedy film In the Loop, the character of Malcolm Tucker references the battle by saying \\"We [meaning the British] burned this tight-arsed city [meaning Washington] to the ground in 1814, and I'm all for doing it again\\" during a heated confrontation with a young staffer inside The White House.","input":"When did the burning of washington dc happen?"},{"output":"at the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai","context":"Zhong Zhong (Chinese: ; pinyin: Zhng Zhng, born 27 November 2017)[1] and Hua Hua (Chinese: òò; pinyin: Hu Hu, born 5 December 2017)[1] are a pair of identical crab-eating macaques (also referred to as cynomolgus monkeys) that were created through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the same cloning technique that produced Dolly the sheep in 1996. They are the first cloned primates produced by this technique. Unlike previous attempts to clone monkeys, the donated nuclei came from fetal cells, not embryonic cells.[2][3][4][5][6] The primates were both born at the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince scientists produced the first cloned mammal Dolly the sheep in 1996 using the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique, 23 mammalian species have been successfully cloned, including cattle, cats, dogs, horses and rats.[5] Using this technique for primates had never been successful and no pregnancy had lasted more than 80 days. The main difficulty was likely the proper programming of the transferred nuclei to support the growth of the embryo.[4] Tetra (born October 1999), a female rhesus macaque, was created by a team led by Gerald Schatten of the Oregon National Primate Research Center using a different technique, called \\"embryo splitting\\". She is the first \\"cloned\\" primate by artificial twinning, which is a much less complex procedure than the DNA transfer used for the creation of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua.[8]\\r\\nZhong Zhong and Hua Hua were produced by scientists from the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, led by Qiang Sun and Muming Poo.[2] They extracted nuclei from the fibroblasts of an aborted fetal monkey (a crab-eating macaque or Macaca fascicularis) and inserted them into egg cells (ova) that had had their own nuclei removed.[2] The team used two enzymes to erase the epigenetic memory of the transferred nuclei of being somatic cells. This crucial reprogramming step allowed the researchers to overcome the main obstacle that had precluded the successful cloning of primates until now.[4] They then placed 21 of these ova into surrogate mother monkeys, resulting in six pregnancies, two of which produced living animals.[2] The monkeys were named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, a reference to Zhonghua (Chinese: ò, a Chinese name for China).[1] Although the success rate was still low, the methods could be improved to increase survival rate in the future.[4] By comparison, the Scotland-based team that created Dolly the sheep in 1996 required 277 attempts and produced only one lamb.[9]\\r\\nThe scientists also attempted to clone macaques using nuclei from adult donors, which is much more difficult. They implanted 42 surrogates, resulting in 22 pregnancies, but there were still only two infant macaques, and they died soon after birth.[2]\\r\\nAccording to Muming Poo, the principal significance of this event is that it could be used to create genetically identical monkeys for use in animal experiments. Crab-eating macaques are already an established model organism for studies of atherosclerosis,[10] though Poo chose to emphasize neuroscience, naming Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease when he appeared on the radio news program All Things Considered in January 2018.[11]\\r\\nThe birth of the two cloned primates also raised concerns from bioethicists. Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University questioned whether this meant that human cloning would be next. Poo told All Things Considered that \\"Technically speaking one can clone human[s]?... But we're not going to do it. There's absolutely no plan to do anything on humans.\\"[11]","input":"Where were zhong zhong and hua hua born?"},{"output":"July 4, 1817","context":"The Erie Canal is a canal in New York that is part of the eastÿwest, cross-state route of the New York State Canal System (formerly known as the New York State Barge Canal). Originally, it ran 363 miles (584?km) from Albany, on the Hudson River, to Buffalo, at Lake Erie. It was built to create a navigable water route from New York City and the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. When completed in 1825, it was the second longest canal in the world (after the Grand Canal in China) and greatly affected the development and economy of New York, New York City, and the United States.[2]\\r\\nFirst proposed in the 1780s, then re-proposed in 1807, a survey was authorized, funded, and executed in 1808. Proponents of the project gradually wore down opponents; its construction began in 1817. The canal has 35 numbered locks, plus the Federal Black Rock Lock,[1] and an elevation differential of about 565 feet (172?m). It opened on October 26, 1825.[3]\\r\\nIn a time when bulk goods were limited to pack animals (a 250 pounds (113?kg) maximum[4]), and there were no railways, water was the most cost-effective way to ship bulk goods.\\r\\nThe canal, denigrated by its political opponents as \\"Clinton's Folly\\"[5] or \\"Clinton's Big Ditch\\",[6][7] was the first transportation system between the eastern seaboard and the western interior of the United States that did not require portage.\\r\\nIt was faster than carts pulled by draft animals and cut transport costs by about 95%.[8] The canal gave New York City's port an incomparable advantage over all other U.S. port cities and ushered in the state's 19th century political and cultural ascendancy.[2] The canal fostered a population surge in western New York and opened regions farther west to settlement. It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. The canal's peak year was 1855, when 33,000 commercial shipments took place. In 1918, the western part of the canal was enlarged to become part of the New York State Barge Canal, which ran parallel to the eastern half of the Erie Canal, and extended to the Hudson River. In 2000, the United States Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor[9] to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of civil engineering and construction in North America.[9] Mainly used by recreational watercraft since the retirement of the last large commercial ship, the Day Peckinpaugh in 1994, the canal saw a recovery in commercial traffic in 2008.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the first days of the expansion of the British colonies from the coast of North America into the heartland of the continent, a recurring problem was that of transportation between the coastal ports and the interior. This was not unique to the Americas, and the problem still exists in those parts of the world where muscle power provides a primary means of transportation within a region. An equally ancient solution was implemented in many culturesthings in the water weighed far less and took less effort to move since friction became negligible. Close to the seacoast, rivers often provided adequate waterways, but the Appalachian Mountains, 400 miles (640?km) inland, running over 1,500 miles (2,400?km) long as a barrier range with just five places where mule trains or wagon roads could be routed,[11] presented a great challenge. Passengers and freight had to travel overland, a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads. In 1800, it typically took 2-1/2 weeks to travel overland from New York to Cleveland, Ohio (460 miles (740?km)); 4 weeks to Detroit (612 miles (985?km)).[12]\\r\\nThe principal exportable product of the Ohio Valley was grain, which was a high-volume, low-priced commodity, bolstered by supplies from the coast. Frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far-away population centers. This was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales, and later the Whiskey Rebellion. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap, reliable route to the West would enjoy economic success, and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly.[13] In time, projects were devised in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and relatively deep into the coastal states.\\r\\nThe successes of the Canal du Midi in France (1681), Bridgewater Canal in Britain (1769), and Eiderkanal in Denmark (1784) spurred on what was called in Britain \\"canal mania\\". The idea of a canal to tie the East Coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as 1724: New York provincial official Cadwallader Colden made a passing reference (in a report on fur trading) to improving the natural waterways of western New York.\\r\\nGouverneur Morris and Elkanah Watson were early proponents of a canal along the Mohawk River. Their efforts led to the creation of the \\"Western and Northern Inland Lock Navigation Companies\\" in 1792, which took the first steps to improve navigation on the Mohawk and construct a canal between the Mohawk and Lake Ontario,[14] but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient. Christopher Colles (who was familiar with the Bridgewater Canal) surveyed the Mohawk Valley, and made a presentation to the New York state legislature in 1784, proposing a shorter canal from Lake Ontario. The proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented.\\r\\nJesse Hawley had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western New York plains (then largely unsettled) for sale on the Eastern seaboard. However, he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast. While in Canandaigua debtors' prison, Hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the 90-mile (140?km)-long Mohawk River valley with support from Joseph Ellicott (agent for the Holland Land Company in Batavia). Ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state. He later became the first canal commissioner.\\r\\nThe Mohawk River (a tributary of the Hudson) rises near Lake Ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the Catskill range of the Appalachian Mountains, separating them from the geologically distinct Adirondacks to the north. The Mohawk and Hudson valleys form the only cut across the Appalachians north of Alabama, allowing an almost complete water route from New York City in the south to Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in the west. Along its course and from these lakes, other Great Lakes, and to a lesser degree, related rivers, a large part of the continent's interior (and many settlements) would be made well connected to the Eastern seaboard.\\r\\nThe problem was that the land rises about 600 feet (180?m) from the Hudson to Lake Erie. Locks at the time could handle up to 12 feet (3.7?m) of lift, so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts, fifty locks would be required along the 360-mile (580?km) canal. Such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology; in 1800, the expense was barely imaginable. President Thomas Jefferson called it \\"a little short of madness\\" and rejected it; however, Hawley interested New York Governor DeWitt Clinton in the project. There was much opposition, and the project was ridiculed as \\"Clinton's folly\\" and \\"Clinton's ditch.\\" In 1817, though, Clinton received approval from the legislature for $7?million for construction.[3]\\r\\nThe original canal was 363 miles (584?km) long, from Albany on the Hudson to Buffalo on Lake Erie. The channel was cut 40 feet (12?m) wide and 4 feet (1.2?m) deep, with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath.[3]\\r\\nIts construction, through limestone and mountains, proved a daunting task. In 1823 construction reached the Niagara Escarpment, necessitating the building of five locks along a 3-mile (4.8?km) corridor to carry the canal over the escarpment. To move earth, animals pulled a \\"slip scraper\\" (similar to a bulldozer). The sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay, and the bottom was also lined with clay. The stonework required hundreds of German masons, who later built many of New York's buildings. All labor on the canal depended upon human (and animal) power or the force of water. Engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water; one aqueduct was 950 feet (290?m) long to span 800 feet (240?m) of river. As the canal progressed, the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force.\\r\\nCanal boats up to 3.5 feet (1.1?m) in draft were pulled by horses and mules on the towpath. The canal had one towpath, generally on the north side. When canal boats met, the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal. The other boat steered toward the berm (or heelpath) side of the canal. The driver (or \\"hoggee\\", pronounced HO-gee) of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath, while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team. His towline would be unhitched from the horses, go slack, fall into the water and sink to the bottom, while his boat decelerated on with its remaining momentum. The privileged boat's team would step over the other boat's towline, with their horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping. Once clear, the other boat's team would continue on its way.\\r\\nPulled by teams of horses, canal boats still moved slowly, but methodically, shrinking time and distance. Efficiently, the nonstop smooth method of transportation cut the travel time between Albany and Buffalo nearly in half, moving by day and by night. Venturing west, men and women boarded packets to visit relatives, or solely for a relaxing excursion. Emigrants took passage on freight boats, camping on deck, or on top of crates. Packet boats, serving passengers exclusively, reached speeds of up to five miles an hour, and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped, bumpy stages.[15]:54\\r\\nPacket boats, measuring up to seventy-eight feet in length and fourteen and a half feet across, made ingenious use of space, in order to accommodate up to forty passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime.[15]:59 The best examples, furnished with carpeted floors, stuffed chairs, and mahogany tables stocked with current newspapers and books, served as sitting rooms during the days. At mealtimes, crews transformed the cabin into dining rooms. Drawing a curtain across the width of the room divided the cabin into ladies' and gentlemen's sleeping quarters in the evening hours. Pull-down tiered beds folded from the walls, and additional cots could be hung from hooks in the ceiling. Some captains hired musicians and held dances.[15]:59 The canal had brought civilization into the wilderness.\\r\\nThe men who planned and oversaw construction were novices as surveyors and as engineers. There were no civil engineers in the United States.[16] James Geddes and Benjamin Wright, who laid out the route, were judges whose experience in surveying was in settling boundary disputes. Geddes had only used a surveying instrument for a few hours before his work on the Canal.[16] Canvass White was a 27-year-old amateur engineer who persuaded Clinton to let him go to Britain at his own expense to study the canal system there. Nathan Roberts was a mathematics teacher and land speculator. Yet these men \\"carried the Erie Canal up the Niagara escarpment at Lockport, maneuvered it onto a towering embankment to cross over Irondequoit Creek, spanned the Genesee River on an awesome aqueduct, and carved a route for it out of the solid rock between Little Falls and Schenectadyand all of those venturesome designs worked precisely as planned\\". (Bernstein, p.?381)\\r\\nConstruction began July 4, 1817, at Rome, New York. The first 15 miles (24?km), from Rome to Utica, opened in 1819. At that rate, the canal would not be finished for 30 years. The main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil, which took longer than expected, but the builders devised ways to solve these problems. To fell a tree, they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down. They pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller. A pair of huge wheels were mounted loose on an axle. A large wheel, barely smaller than the others, was fixed to the center of the axle. A chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump. A rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen. The mechanical advantage (torque) obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil. Soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule-pulled carts. Using a scraper and a plow, a three-man team with oxen, horses, and mules could build a mile in a year.[17]\\r\\nThe remaining problem was finding labor; increased immigration helped fill the need. Many of the laborers working on the canal were Irish, who had recently come to the United States as a group of about 5,000 from Ireland, most of whom were Roman Catholic, a religion that raised much suspicion in early America due to its hierarchic structure, and many laborers on the canal suffered violent assault as the result of misjudgment and xenophobia.[15]:52\\r\\nConstruction continued at an increased rate as new workers arrived. When the canal reached Montezuma Marsh (at the outlet of Cayuga Lake west of Syracuse), it was rumored over 1,000 workers died of \\"swamp fever\\" (malaria), and construction was temporarily stopped.[18] However, recent research has revealed the death toll was likely much lower, as no contemporary reports mention significant worker mortality, and mass graves from the period have never been found in the area.[19] Work continued on the downhill side towards the Hudson, and when the marsh froze in winter, the crews worked to complete the section across the swamps.\\r\\nThe middle section from Utica to Salina (Syracuse) was completed in 1820, and traffic on that section started up immediately. Expansion to the east and west proceeded, and the whole eastern section, 250 miles (400?km) from Brockport to Albany, opened on September 10, 1823 to great fanfare.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Champlain Canal, a separate but interconnected 64-mile (103?km) north-south route from Watervliet on the Hudson to Lake Champlain, opened on the same date.\\r\\nIn 1824, before the canal was completed, a detailed Pocket Guide for the Tourist and Traveler, Along the Line of the Canals, and the Interior Commerce of the State of New York, was published for the benefit of travelers and land speculators.\\r\\nAfter Montezuma Marsh, the next difficulties were crossing Irondequoit Creek and the Genesee River near Rochester. The first ultimately required building the 1,320-foot (400?m) long \\"Great Embankment,\\" which carried the canal at a height of 76 feet (23?m) above the level of the creek, which was carried through a 245-foot (75?m) culvert underneath.[20] The river was crossed on a stone aqueduct 802 feet (244?m) long and 17 feet (5.2?m) wide, with 11 arches.[21]\\r\\nAfter the Genesee, the next obstacle was crossing the Niagara Escarpment, an 80-foot (24?m) wall of hard dolomitic limestone, to rise to the level of Lake Erie. The route followed the channel of a creek that had cut a ravine steeply down the escarpment, with two sets of five locks in a series, soon giving rise to the community of Lockport. The 12-foot (3.7?m) lift-locks had a total lift of 60 feet (18?m), exiting into a deeply cut channel. The final leg had to be cut 30 feet (9.1?m) through another limestone layer, the Onondaga ridge. Much of that section was blasted with black powder, and the inexperience of the crews often led to accidents, and sometimes rocks falling on nearby homes.[citation needed]\\r\\nTwo villages competed to be the terminus: Black Rock, on the Niagara River, and Buffalo, at the eastern tip of Lake Erie. Buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen Buffalo Creek to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth. Buffalo won over Black Rock, and grew into a large city, eventually encompassing its former competitor.\\r\\nThe entire canal was officially completed on October 26, 1825. The event was marked by a statewide \\"Grand Celebration,\\" culminating in successive cannon shots along the length of the canal and the Hudson, a 90-minute cannonade from Buffalo to New York City. A flotilla of boats, led by Governor Dewitt Clinton aboard the Seneca Chief, sailed from Buffalo to New York City in ten days. Clinton then ceremonially poured Lake Erie water into New York Harbor to mark the \\"Wedding of the Waters\\". On its return trip, the Seneca Chief brought a keg of Atlantic Ocean water back to Buffalo to be poured into Lake Erie by Buffalo's Judge Samuel Wilkeson, who would later become mayor.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of $7,143,000.[22] (Equivalent to $140 billion today.[23]) It was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped New York City become a financial capital.[3]\\r\\nThe canal began on the west side of the Hudson River at Albany, and ran north to Watervliet, where the Champlain Canal branched off. At Cohoes, it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the Hudson River and then turned west along the south shore of the Mohawk River, crossing to the north side at Crescent and again to the south at Rexford. The canal continued west near the south shore of the Mohawk River all the way to Rome, where the Mohawk turns north.[3]\\r\\nAt Rome, the canal continued west parallel to Wood Creek, which flows westward into Oneida Lake, and turned southwest and west cross-country to avoid the lake. From Canastota west, it ran roughly along the north (lower) edge of the Onondaga Escarpment, passing through Syracuse, Onondaga Lake, and Rochester. Before reaching Rochester, the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of Irondequoit Creek. At Lockport the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the Niagara Escarpment, using the ravine of Eighteen Mile Creek.[3]\\r\\nThe canal continued south-southwest to Pendleton, where it turned west and southwest, mainly using the channel of Tonawanda Creek. From the Tonawanda south toward Buffalo, it ran just east of the Niagara River, where it reached its \\"Western Terminus\\" at Little Buffalo Creek (later it became the Commercial Slip), which discharged into the Buffalo River just above its confluence with Lake Erie.[3] With Buffalo's re-excavation of the Commercial Slip, completed in 2008, the Canal's original terminus is now re-watered and again accessible by boats. With several miles of the Canal inland of this location still lying under 20th-century fill and urban construction, the effective western navigable terminus of the Erie Canal is found at Tonawanda.\\r\\nThe Erie made use of the favorable conditions of New York's unique topography, which provided that area with the only break in the Appalachians south of the Saint Lawrence River. The Hudson is tidal to Troy, and Albany is west of the Appalachians. It allowed for eastÿwest navigation from the coast to the Great Lakes within US?territory.[24] The canal system thus gave New York a competitive advantage, helped New York City develop as an international trade center, and allowed Buffalo to grow from just 200?settlers in 1820 to more than 18,000 people by 1840. The port of New York became essentially the Atlantic home port for all of the Midwestbecause of this vital connection and others to follow, such as the railroads, New York would become known as the \\"Empire State\\" or \\"the great Empire State\\".[3]\\r\\nProblems developed but were quickly solved. Leaks developed along the entire length of the canal, but these were sealed using cement that hardened underwater (hydraulic cement). Erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to 4?mph (6?km/h).\\r\\nThe original design planned for an annual tonnage of 1.5?million tons (1.36 million metric tons), but this was exceeded immediately. An ambitious program to improve the canal began in 1834. During this massive series of construction projects, known as the First Enlargement, the canal was widened from 40 feet (12?m) to 70 feet (21?m) and deepened from 4 feet (1.2?m) to 7 feet (2.1?m). Locks were widened and/or rebuilt in new locations, and many new navigable aqueducts were constructed. The canal was straightened and slightly re-routed in some stretches, resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original 1825 canal. The First Enlargement was completed in 1862, with further minor enlargements in later decades.\\r\\nToday, the reconfiguration of the canal created during the First Enlargement is commonly referred to as the \\"Improved Erie Canal\\" or the \\"Old Erie Canal\\", to distinguish it from the canal's modern-day course. Existing remains of the 1825 canal abandoned during the Enlargement are sometimes referred to today as \\"Clinton's Ditch\\" (which was also the popular nickname for the entire Erie Canal project during its original 1817ÿ1825 construction).\\r\\nAdditional feeder canals soon extended the Erie Canal into a system. These included the Cayuga-Seneca Canal south to the Finger Lakes, the Oswego Canal from Three Rivers north to Lake Ontario at Oswego, and the Champlain Canal from Troy north to Lake Champlain. From 1833 to 1877, the short Crooked Lake Canal connected Keuka Lake and Seneca Lake. The Chemung Canal connected the south end of Seneca Lake to Elmira in 1833, and was an important route for Pennsylvania coal and timber into the canal system. The Chenango Canal in 1836 connected the Erie Canal at Utica to Binghamton and caused a business boom in the Chenango River valley. The Chenango and Chemung canals linked the Erie with the Susquehanna River system. The Black River Canal connected the Black River to the Erie Canal at Rome and remained in operation until the 1920s. The Genesee Valley Canal was run along the Genesee River to connect with the Allegheny River at Olean, but the Allegheny section, which would have connected to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, was never built. The Genesee Valley Canal was later abandoned and became the route of the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad.\\r\\nIn 1903 the New York State legislature authorized construction of the New York State Barge Canal as the \\"Improvement of the Erie, the Oswego, the Champlain, and the Cayuga and Seneca Canals\\".[25]:14 In 1905, construction of the Barge Canal began, which was completed in 1918, at a cost of $96.7 million.[25]:557 Freight traffic reached a total of 5.2 million short tons (4.7 million metric tons) by 1951, before declining in the face of combined rail and truck competition.\\r\\nAs the canal brought travelers to New York City, it took business away from other ports such as Philadelphia and Baltimore. Those cities and their states started projects to compete with the Erie Canal. In Pennsylvania, the Main Line of Public Works was a combined canal and railroad running west from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh on the Ohio River, opened in 1834. In Maryland, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ran west to Wheeling, West Virginia, also on the Ohio River, and was completed in 1853.\\r\\nOther competition was more direct. The Mohawk and Hudson Railroad opened in 1837, providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between Albany and Schenectady. Other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to Buffalo, and in 1842 a continuous line (which later became the New York Central Railroad and its Auburn Road in 1853) was open the whole way to Buffalo. As the railroad served the same general route as the canal, but provided for faster travel, passengers soon switched to it. However, as late as 1852, the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in New York State combined; it continued to compete well with the railroads through 1902, when tolls were abolished.\\r\\nThe New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway was completed in 1884, as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the New York Central Railroad. However, it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the New York Central.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the Midwest and the Northeast, bringing much lower food costs to Eastern cities and allowing the East to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the Midwest. The canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of New York City, Buffalo, and New York State. Its impact went much further, increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to Midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the West.[26][27]\\r\\nThe Erie Canal was an immediate success. Tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state's construction debt in its first year of official operation.[15]:52 By 1828, import duties collected at the New York Customs House supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in Washington except the interest on the national debt.[28] Additionally, New York state's initial loan for the original canal had been paid by 1837.[15]:52 Although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats, passengers also traveled on the canal's packet boats. In 1825 more than forty thousand passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel.[15]:52 The canal's steady flow of tourists, businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors. Evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region and the canal served as the last leg of the underground railroad ferrying runaway slaves to Buffalo near the CanadaÿUS border.[15]:53 Aspiring merchants found that tourists proved to double as reliable customers. Vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books, watches and fruit while less scrupulous \\"confidence men\\" sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills.[15]:53 Tourists were carried along the \\"northern tour\\", which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination Niagara Falls, just north of Buffalo.\\r\\nConsisting of a massive stone aqueduct which carried boats over incredible cascades, Little Falls was one of the most popular stops for American and foreign touristsas depicted in Scene 4 of William Dunlap's play A Trip to Niagara, where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could see a combination of artificial and natural sites.[15]:55 Canal travel was, for many, an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature. The play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some seeing movement on the canal as tedious.\\r\\nNew ethnic Irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion, as Irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force. Earth extracted from the canal was transported to the New York city area and used as landfill in New York and New Jersey.[citation needed] A plaque honoring the canal's construction is located in Battery Park in southern Manhattan.\\r\\nBecause so many immigrants traveled on the canal, many genealogists have sought copies of canal passenger lists. Apart from the years 1827ÿ1829, canal boat operators were not required to record or report passenger names to the government, which, in this case, was the state of New York. Those passenger lists that were recorded survive today in the New York State Archives, and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available.\\r\\nThe Canal also helped bind the still-new nation closer to Britain and Europe. British repeal of the Corn Law resulted in a huge increase in exports of Midwestern wheat to Britain. Trade between the United States and Canada also increased as a result of the Corn Law and a reciprocity (free-trade) agreement signed in 1854; much of this trade flowed along the Erie.\\r\\nIts success also prompted imitation: a rash of canal-building followed. Also, the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible. This led to an increased public esteem for practical education. Chicago, among other Great Lakes cities, recognized the commercial importance of the canal to its economy, and two West Loop streets are named \\"Canal\\" and \\"Clinton\\" (for canal proponent DeWitt Clinton).\\r\\nConcern that erosion caused by logging in the Adirondacks could silt up the canal contributed to the creation of another New York National Historic Landmark, the Adirondack Park, in 1885.\\r\\nMany notable authors wrote about the canal, including Herman Melville, Frances Trollope, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Mark Twain, Samuel Hopkins Adams and the Marquis de?Lafayette, and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal. The popular song \\"Low Bridge\\" by Thomas S. Allen was written in 1905 to memorialize the canal's early heyday, when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines.\\r\\nThe New York State Legislature debated closing the locks of the Erie Canal on Sundays, when they convened in 1858. However, George Jeremiah and Dwight Bacheller, two of the bill's opponents, argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the Erie Canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state. The canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature, an artificial river where there had been none. The canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads. Jeremiah and Bacheller argued, successfully, that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on Sunday, it was so with the canal.[15]:172\\r\\nIn 1918, the Canal was replaced by the larger New York State Barge Canal. This new canal replaced much of the original route, leaving many abandoned sections (most notably between Syracuse and Rome). New digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to canalize rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid, such as the Mohawk, Seneca, and Clyde rivers, and Oneida Lake. In sections that did not consist of canalized rivers (particularly between Rochester and Buffalo), the original Erie Canal channel was enlarged to 120 feet (37?m) wide and 12 feet (3.7?m) deep. The expansion allowed barges up to 2,000 short tons (1,800?t) to use the Canal. This expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal, and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping.\\r\\nThe new alignment began on the Hudson River at the border between Cohoes and Waterford, where it ran northwest with five locks (the so-called \\"Waterford Flight\\"), running into the Mohawk River east of Crescent. The Waterford Flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world.[29][3]:19[30]:267\\r\\nWhile the old Canal ran next to the Mohawk all the way to Rome, the new canal ran through the river, which was straightened or widened where necessary.[3]:13 At Ilion, the new canal left the river for good, but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to Rome. From Rome, the new route continued almost due west, merging with Fish Creek just east of its entry into Oneida Lake.\\r\\nFrom Oneida Lake, the new canal ran west along the Oneida River, with cutoffs to shorten the route. At Three Rivers the Oneida River turns northwest, and was deepened for the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario. The new Erie Canal turned south there along the Seneca River, which turns west near Syracuse and continues west to a point in the Montezuma Marsh (430011N 764352W? / ?43.00296N 76.73115W? / 43.00296; -76.73115). There the Cayuga and Seneca Canal continued south with the Seneca River, and the new Erie Canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment, in some places running along the Clyde River, and in some places replacing the old canal. At Pittsford, southeast of Rochester, the canal turned west to run around the south side of Rochester, rather than through downtown. The canal crosses the Genesee River at the Genesee Valley Park (430717N 773833W? / ?43.1215N 77.6425W? / 43.1215; -77.6425), then rejoins the old path near North Gates.\\r\\nFrom there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal, running west to Lockport. This reach of 64.2?miles from Henrietta to Lockport is called \\"the 60?mile level\\" since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet over the entire segment. Diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal's level. It runs southwest to Tonawanda, where the new alignment discharges into the Niagara River, which is navigable upstream to the New York Barge Canal's Black Rock Lock and thence to the Canal's original \\"Western Terminus\\" at Buffalo's Inner Harbor.\\r\\nThe growth of railroads and highways across the state, and the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the 20th century.\\r\\nIn 1992, the New York State Barge Canal was renamed the New York State Canal System (including the Erie, Cayuga-Seneca, Oswego, and Champlain canals) and placed under the newly created New York State Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority. The canal system is operated using money generated by Thruway tolls.\\r\\nSince the 1990s, the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic, although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it.\\r\\nToday, the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor covers 524 miles (843?km) of navigable water from Lake Champlain to the Capital Region and west to Buffalo. The area has a population of 2.7?million: about 75% of Central and Western New York's population lives within 25 miles (40?km) of the Erie Canal.\\r\\nThe Erie Canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from May through November each year. During winter, water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance. The Champlain Canal, Lake Champlain, and the Chambly Canal, and Richelieu River in Canada form the Lakes to Locks Passage, making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern Canada to the Erie Canal. In 2006 recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors.\\r\\nTravel on the canal's middle section (particularly in the Mohawk Valley) was severely hampered by flooding in late June and early July 2006. Flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least $15 million.\\r\\nThere were some 42 commercial shipments on the canal in 2008, compared to 15 such shipments in 2007 and more than 33,000 shipments in 1855, the canal's peak year. The new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel. Canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo 514 miles (827?km) on one gallon of diesel fuel, while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo 202 miles (325?km) and a truck 59 miles (95?km). Canal barges can carry loads up to 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons), and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment.[10] Today, the system is served by several commercial towing companies.[31] In 2012, the New York State Canal System (which consists of the Erie Canal and a few smaller canals) was used to ship 42,000 tons of cargo.[32]\\r\\nAside from transportation, the canal's waters are still utilized for other purposes such as irrigation for farmland, hydroelectricity, research, industry, and even drinking by numerous businesses, farms, factories and communities alongside its banks. Users of the canal system have an estimated total economic impact of $6.2 billion annually.[32]\\r\\nSections of the old Erie Canal not used after 1918 are owned by New York State, or have been ceded to or purchased by counties or municipalities. Many stretches of the old canal have been filled in to create roads such as Erie Boulevard in Syracuse and Schenectady, and Broad Street and the Rochester Subway in Rochester. A 36?mile (58?km) stretch of the old canal from the town of DeWitt, New York, east of Syracuse, to just outside Rome, New York, is preserved as the Old Erie Canal State Historic Park. In 1960 the Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site, a section of the canal in Montgomery County, was one of the first sites recognized as a National Historic Landmark.[33]\\r\\nSome municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks, or have plans to do so. Camillus Erie Canal Park preserves a 7-mile (11?km) stretch and has restored Nine Mile Creek Aqueduct, built in 1841 as part of the First Enlargement of the canal.[34] In some communities, the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris. Proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown Rochester or Syracuse as a tourist attraction. In Syracuse, the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown's Clinton Square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure, now dry.[citation needed] Buffalo's Commercial Slip is the restored and re-watered segment of the canal which formed its \\"Western Terminus\\".\\r\\nThe Erie Canal is a destination for tourists from all over the world, and has inspired guidebooks dedicated to exploration of the waterway.[30][35] An Erie Canal Cruise company, based in Herkimer, operates from mid-May until mid-October with daily cruises. The cruise goes through the history of the canal and also takes passengers through Lock 18.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 2004, the administration of New York Governor George Pataki was criticized when officials of New York State Canal Corporation attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the Old Erie Canal to a single developer for $30,000, far less than the land was worth on the open market. After an investigation by the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper, the Pataki administration nullified the deal.[citation needed]\\r\\nRecords of the planning, design, construction, and administration of the Erie Canal are vast and can be found in the New York State Archives. Except for two years (1827ÿ1829), the State of New York did not require canal boat operators to maintain or submit passenger lists.[36]\\r\\nParks and museums related to the old Erie Canal include (listed from East to West):\\r\\nThe following list of locks is provided for the current canal, from east to west. There are a total of 36 (35 numbered) locks on the Erie Canal.\\r\\nAll locks on the New York State Canal System are single-chamber; the dimensions are 328 feet (100 m) long and 45 feet (13.7 m) wide with a minimum 12-foot (3.7 m) depth of water over the miter sills at the upstream gates upon lift. They can accommodate a vessel up to 300 feet (91 m) long and 43.5 feet (13.3 m) wide.[38][39][40] Overall sidewall height will vary by lock, ranging between 28 feet (8.5 m) and 61 feet (18.6 m) depending on the lift and navigable stages. Lock E17 at Little Falls has the tallest sidewall height at 80 feet (24.4 m).[41]\\r\\nDistance is based on position markers from an interactive canal map provided online by the New York State Canal Corporation and may not exactly match specifications on signs posted along the canal. Mean surface elevations are comprised from a combination of older canal profiles and history books as well as specifications on signs posted along the canal.[38][42][43] The margin of error should normally be within 6 inches (15.2?cm).\\r\\nThe Waterford Flight series of locks (comprising Locks E2 through E6) is one of the steepest in the world, lifting boats 169 feet (52?m) in less than 2 miles (3.2?km).[3]:19[29][30]:267\\r\\nAll surface elevations are approximate.\\r\\n(upstream/west)\\r\\n(downstream/east)\\r\\n(upstream/west)\\r\\n* Denotes Federal managed locks.\\r\\nThere is roughly a 2-foot (0.6 m) natural rise between locks E33 and E34 as well as a 1.5-foot (0.5 m) natural rise between Lock E35 and the Niagara River.[40]\\r\\nOneida Lake lies between locks E22 and E23, and has a mean surface elevation of 370 feet (112.8 m). Lake Erie has a mean surface elevation of 571 feet (174.1 m).","input":"When did the erie canal started being built?"},{"output":"late 18th and early 19th-century","context":"Neoclassical architecture is an architectural style produced by the neoclassical movement that began in the mid-18th century. In its purest form, it is a style principally derived from the architecture of classical antiquity, the Vitruvian principles, and the work of the Italian architect Andrea Palladio.[1]\\r\\nIn form, neoclassical architecture emphasizes the wall rather than chiaroscuro and maintains separate identities to each of its parts. The style is manifested both in its details as a reaction against the Rococo style of naturalistic ornament, and in its architectural formulae as an outgrowth of some classicising features of the Late Baroque architectural tradition. Neoclassical architecture is still designed today, but may be labelled New Classical Architecture for contemporary buildings.\\r\\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, the style is usually referred to as Classicism (German: Klassizismus), while the newer revival styles of the 19th century until today are called neoclassical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectually, neoclassicism was symptomatic of a desire to return to the perceived \\"purity\\" of the arts of Rome, to the more vague perception (\\"ideal\\") of Ancient Greek arts and, to a lesser extent, 16th-century Renaissance Classicism, which was also a source for academic Late Baroque architecture.\\r\\nMany early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of tienne-Louis Boulle and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boulle and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boulle's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \\"architecture parlante\\".\\r\\nA return to more classical architectural forms as a reaction to the Rococo style can be detected in some European architecture of the earlier 18th century, most vividly represented in the Palladian architecture of Georgian Britain and Ireland.\\r\\nThe baroque style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: Vitruvius Britannicus (Colen Campbell 1715), Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1715), De Re Aedificatoria (1726) and The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs (1727). The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. Palladian architecture became well established in 18th-century Britain.\\r\\nAt the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic \\"architect earl\\", Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed Chiswick House. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism. In 1734 William Kent and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with Holkham Hall in Norfolk. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance.\\r\\nThis classicising vein was also detectable, to a lesser degree, in the Late Baroque architecture in Paris, such as in Perrault's east range of the Louvre. This shift was even visible in Rome at the redesigned fa?ade for S. Giovanni in Laterano.\\r\\nBy the mid 18th century, the movement broadened to incorporate a greater range of Classical influences, including those from Ancient Greece. The shift to neoclassical architecture is conventionally dated to the 1750s. It first gained influence in England and France; in England, Sir William Hamilton's excavations at Pompeii and other sites, the influence of the Grand Tour and the work of William Chambers and Robert Adam, was pivotal in this regard. In France, the movement was propelled by a generation of French art students trained in Rome, and was influenced by the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann. The style was also adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia.\\r\\nInternational neoclassical architecture was exemplified in Karl Friedrich Schinkel's buildings, especially the Old Museum in Berlin, Sir John Soane's Bank of England in London and the newly built White House and Capitol in Washington, D.C. of the nascent American Republic. The style was international.\\r\\nA second neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the Napoleonic Empire. In France, the first phase of neoclassicism was expressed in the \\"Louis XVI style\\", and the second in the styles called \\"Directoire\\" or Empire. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.[according to whom?]\\r\\nIn the decorative arts, neoclassicism is exemplified in French furniture of the Empire style; the English furniture of Chippendale, George Hepplewhite and Robert Adam, Wedgwood's bas reliefs and \\"black basaltes\\" vases, and the Biedermeier furniture of Austria. The Scottish architect Charles Cameron created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born Catherine II the Great in St. Petersburg.[2]\\r\\nIndoors, neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of Le Antichit di Ercolano (The Antiquities of Herculaneum). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicising interiors of the Baroque, or the most \\"Roman\\" rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appearance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts.\\r\\nThe new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low frieze-like relief or painted in monotones en cama?eu (\\"like cameos\\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or bucrania or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \\"Pompeiian red\\" or pale tints, or stone colours. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the Go?t grec (\\"Greek style\\"), not a court style; when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \\"Louis XVI\\" style to court.\\r\\nHowever, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \\"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\\".[3]\\r\\nA new phase in neoclassical design was inaugurated by Robert and James Adam, who travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they published a book entitled The Works in Architecture in installments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the Adam repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the rococo and baroque styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. The Works in Architecture illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams.\\r\\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism, the Greek Revival. There was little to no direct knowledge of Greek civilization before the middle of the 18th century in Western Europe, when an expedition funded by the Society of Dilettanti in 1751 and led by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett began serious archaeological enquiry. Stuart was commissioned after his return from Greece by George Lyttelton to produce the first Greek building in England, the garden temple at Hagley Hall (1758ÿ59).[4] A number of British architects in the second half of the century took up the expressive challenge of the Doric from their aristocratic patrons, including Joseph Bonomi and John Soane, but it was to remain the private enthusiasm of connoisseurs up to the first decade of the 19th century.\\r\\nSeen in its wider social context, Greek Revival architecture sounded a new note of sobriety and restraint in public buildings in Britain around 1800 as an assertion of nationalism attendant on the Act of Union, the Napoleonic Wars, and the clamour for political reform. It was to be William Wilkins's winning design for the public competition for Downing College, Cambridge that announced the Greek style was to be the dominant idiom in architecture. Wilkins and Robert Smirke went on to build some of the most important buildings of the era, including the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden (1808ÿ09), the General Post Office (1824ÿ1829) and the British Museum (1823ÿ1848), Wilkins University College London (1826ÿ1830) and the National Gallery (1832ÿ1838). In Scotland, Thomas Hamilton (1784ÿ1858), in collaboration with the artists Andrew Wilson (1780ÿ1848) and Hugh William Williams (1773ÿ1829) created monuments and buildings of international significance; the Burns Monument at Alloway (1818) and the (Royal) High School in Edinburgh (1823ÿ1829).\\r\\nAt the same time the Empire style in France was a more grandiose wave of neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon I in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the Napoleonstil in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour \\"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\\".[5]\\r\\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in academic art through the 19th century and beyonda constant antithesis to Romanticism or Gothic revivalsalthough from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.[who?] The centres of several European cities, notably St Petersburg and Munich, came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\\r\\nHigh neoclassicism was an international movement. Though neoclassical architecture employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture, it tended to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels. Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated rather than interpenetrating, autonomous and complete in themselves.\\r\\nNeoclassicism also influenced city planning; the ancient Romans had used a consolidated scheme for city planning for both defence and civil convenience, however, the roots of this scheme go back to even older civilizations. At its most basic, the grid system of streets, a central forum with city services, two main slightly wider boulevards, and the occasional diagonal street were characteristic of the very logical and orderly Roman design. Ancient fa?ades and building layouts were oriented to these city design patterns and they tended to work in proportion with the importance of public buildings.\\r\\nMany of these urban planning patterns found their way into the first modern planned cities of the 18th century. Exceptional examples include Karlsruhe and Washington, D.C. Not all planned cities and planned neighbourhoods are designed on neoclassical principles, however. Opposing models may be found in Modernist designs exemplified by Braslia, the Garden city movement, levittowns, and new urbanism.\\r\\nFrom the middle of the 18th century, exploration and publication changed the course of British architecture towards a purer vision of the Ancient Greco-Roman ideal. James 'Athenian' Stuart's work The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece was very influential in this regard, as were Robert Wood's Palmyra and Baalbec. A combination of simple forms and high levels of enrichment was adopted by the majority of contemporary British architects and designers. The revolution begun by Stuart was soon to be eclipsed by the work of the Adam Brothers, James Wyatt, Sir William Chambers, George Dance, James Gandon and provincially based architects such as John Carr and Thomas Harrison of Chester.\\r\\nIn the early 20th century, the writings of Albert Richardson were responsible for a re-awakening of interest in pure neoclassical design. Vincent Harris (compare Harris's colonnaded and domed interior of Manchester Central Reference Library to the colonnaded and domed interior by John Carr and R R Duke), Bradshaw Gass & Hope and Percy Thomas were among those who designed public buildings in the neoclassical style in the interwar period. In the British Raj in India, Sir Edwin Lutyens' monumental city planning for New Delhi marked the sunset of neoclassicism. In Scotland and the north of England, where the Gothic Revival was less strong, architects continued to develop the neoclassical style of William Henry Playfair. The works of Cuthbert Brodrick and Alexander Thomson show that by the end of the 19th century the results could be powerful and eccentric.\\r\\nThe first phase of neoclassicism in France is expressed in the Louis Quinze style of architect Ange-Jacques Gabriel (Petit Trianon, 1762ÿ68); the second phase, in the styles called Directoire and \\"Empire\\", might be characterized by Jean Chalgrin's severe astylar Arc de Triomphe (designed in 1806). In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \\"Go?t grec\\" (\\"Greek style\\") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1774 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the Louis XVI style to court.\\r\\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to neoclassicism that is called the Greek Revival. Although several European cities  notably St Petersburg, Athens, Berlin and Munich  were transformed into veritable museums of Greek revival architecture, the Greek revival in France was never popular with either the State or the public.\\r\\nWhat little there was, started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773ÿ80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785ÿ89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France.\\r\\nAfter the establishment of the Kingdom of Greece in 1832, the architecture of Greece was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, Otto I, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan. The Old Royal Palace was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, Theophil von Hansen and Ernst Ziller took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings. Theophil von Hansen designed his first building, the National Observatory of Athens and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called \\"Athens Classical Trilogy\\", namely the Academy of Athens (1859) and the National Library of Greece (1888), the third building of the trilogy being the National and Capodistrian University of Athens (1843), which was designed by his brother Christian Hansen. Also he designed the Zappeion Hall (1888). Ernst Ziller also designed many private mansions in the center of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such the mansion of Heinrich Schliemann, Iliou Melathron (1880). The city of Nauplio is also an important example of Neoclassical Architecture along with the island of Poros.\\r\\nThe earliest examples of neoclassical architecture in Hungary may be found in Vc. In this town the triumphal arch and the neoclassical fa?ade of the baroque Cathedral were designed by the French architect Isidor Marcellus Amandus Ganneval (Isidore Canevale) in the 1760s. Also the work of a French architect Charles Moreau is the garden fa?ade of the Esterhzy Palace (1797ÿ1805) in Kismarton (today Eisenstadt in Austria). The two principal architect of Neoclassicism in Hungary was Mihly Pollack and J܇zsef Hild. Pollack's major work is the Hungarian National Museum (1837ÿ1844). Hild is famous for his designs for the Cathedral of Eger and Esztergom. The Reformed Great Church of Debrecen is an outstanding example of the many Protestant churches that were built in the first half of the 19th century. This was the time of the first iron structures in Hungarian architecture, the most important of which is the Chain Bridge (Budapest) by William Tierney Clark.\\r\\nNeoclassical architecture was introduced in Malta in the late 18th century, during the final years of Hospitaller rule. Early examples include the Bibliotheca (1786),[6] the De Rohan Arch (1798)[7] and the Hompesch Gate (1801).[8] However, neoclassical architecture only became popular in Malta following the establishment of British rule in the early 19th century. In 1814, a neoclassical portico decorated with the British coat of arms was added to the Main Guard building so as to serve as a symbol of British Malta. Other 19th century neoclassical buildings include the Monument to Sir Alexander Ball (1810), RNH Bighi (1832), St Paul's Pro-Cathedral (1844), the Rotunda of Mosta (1860) and the now-destroyed Royal Opera House (1866).[9]\\r\\nNeoclassicism gave way to other architectural styles by the late 19th century. Few buildings were built in the neoclassical style during the 20th century, such as the Domvs Romana museum (1922),[10] and the Courts of Justice building in Valletta (1965ÿ71).[11]\\r\\nThe center of Polish Neoclassicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king Stanis?aw August Poniatowski. Vilnius University was another important center of the Neoclassical architecture in Europe, led by notable professors of architecture Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevicius and Karol Podczaszyski. The style was expressed in the shape of main public buildings, such as the University's Observatory, Vilnius Cathedral and the town hall.\\r\\nThe best-known architects and artists, who worked in PolishÿLithuanian Commonwealth were Dominik Merlini, Jan Chrystian Kamsetzer, Szymon Bogumi? Zug, Jakub Kubicki, Antonio Corazzi, Efraim Szreger, Chrystian Piotr Aigner and Bertel Thorvaldsen.\\r\\nIn the Russian Empire at the end of the 19th century, neoclassical architecture was equal to Saint Petersburg architecture because this style was specific for a huge number of buildings in the city.\\r\\nIn the Soviet Union (1917ÿ1991), neoclassical architecture was very popular among the political elite, as it effectively expressed state power and a vast array of neoclassical building was erected all over the country.\\r\\nSoviet neoclassical architecture was exported to other socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, as a gift from the Soviet Union. Examples of this include the Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw, Poland and the Shanghai International Convention Centre in Shanghai, China.\\r\\nSpanish Neoclassicism was exemplified by the work of Juan de Villanueva, who adapted Burke's theories of beauty and the sublime to the requirements of Spanish climate and history. He built the Prado Museum, that combined three functions  an academy, an auditorium and a museum  in one building with three separate entrances.\\r\\nThis was part of the ambitious program of Charles III, who intended to make Madrid the Capital of the Arts and Sciences. Very close to the museum, Villanueva built the Astronomical Observatory. He also designed several summer houses for the kings in El Escorial and Aranjuez and reconstructed the Major Square of Madrid, among other important works. Villanuevas pupils expanded the Neoclassical style in Spain.\\r\\nNeoclassical architecture was the preferred style by the leaders of the National Socialist movement in the Third Reich, especially admired by Adolf Hitler himself. Hitler commissioned his favourite architect, Albert Speer, to plan a re-design of Berlin as a city comprising imposing neoclassical structures, which would be renamed as Welthauptstadt Germania, the centrepiece of Hitler's Thousand Year Reich.\\r\\nThese plans never came to fruition due to the eventual downfall of Nazi Germany and the suicide of its leader.[12]\\r\\nIn the new republic, Robert Adam's neoclassical manner was adapted for the local late 18th and early 19th-century style, called \\"Federal architecture\\". One of the pioneers of this style was English-born Benjamin Henry Latrobe, who is often noted as one of the first formally trained America's professional architects and the father of American architecture. The Baltimore Basilica, the first Roman Catholic cathedral in the United States, is considered by many experts to be Latrobe's masterpiece.\\r\\nThe widespread use of neoclassicism in American architecture, as well as by French revolutionary regimes, and the general tenor of rationalism associated with the movement, all created a link between neoclassicism and republicanism and radicalism in much of Europe. The Gothic Revival can be seen as an attempt to present a monarchist and conservative alternative to neoclassicism.\\r\\nIn later 19th-century American architecture, neoclassicism was one expression of the American Renaissance movement, ca 1880ÿ1917. Its last manifestation was in Beaux-Arts architecture (1885ÿ1920), and its very last, large public projects in the United States include the Lincoln Memorial (1922), the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. (1937), and the American Museum of Natural History's Roosevelt Memorial (1936).\\r\\nToday, there is a small revival of Classical Architecture as evidenced by the groups such as The Institute of Classical Architecture and Classical America.[13] The School of Architecture at the University of Notre Dame, currently teaches a fully Classical curriculum.[14]\\r\\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), neoclassicism has seen somewhat of a resurgence. This rebirth can be traced to the movement of New Urbanism and postmodern architecture's embrace of classical elements as ironic, especially in light of the dominance of Modernism. While some continued to work with classicism as ironic, some architects such as Thomas Gordon Smith, began to consider classicism seriously. While some schools had interest in classical architecture, such as the University of Virginia, no school was purely dedicated to classical architecture. In the early 1990s a program in classical architecture was started by Smith and Duncan Stroik at the University of Notre Dame that continues successfully.[15] Programs at the University of Miami, Andrews University, Judson University and The Prince's Foundation for Building Community have trained a number of new classical architects since this resurgence. Today one can find numerous buildings embracing neoclassical style, since a generation of architects trained in this discipline shapes urban planning.\\r\\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism/Revivalism, Traditionalism or simply neoclassical architecture like the historical style.[16] For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term Traditional Architecture (or vernacular) is mostly used. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize.[17]\\r\\nIn the United States various contemporary public buildings are built in neoclassical style, with the 2006 Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville being an example.\\r\\nIn Britain a number of architects are active in the neoclassical style. Two new university Libraries, Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and ADAM Architecture's Sackler Library illustrate that the approach taken can range from the traditional, in the former case, to the unconventional, in the latter case. Recently, Prince Charles came under controversy for promoting a classically designed development on the land of the former Chelsea Barracks in London. Writing to the Qatari Royal family (who were funding the development through the property development company Qatari Diar) he condemned the accepted modernist plans, instead advocating a classical approach. His appeal was met with success and the plans were withdrawn. A new design by architecture firm Dixon Jones is currently being drafted.[18]","input":"When was neo classical architecture brought to america?"},{"output":"the 1994/95 season","context":"First-class\\r\\nOne-day\\r\\nThe Queensland cricket team or the Queensland Bulls, is the Brisbane-based Queensland representative cricket side in Australia's domestic cricket tournaments:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first European settlement in Queensland was a penal colony established at Redcliffe in 1824, which moved to Brisbane the following year. Free settlers first arrived in 1842.\\r\\nThe earliest evidence of cricket being played in Queensland is in 1857, two years prior to separation from New South Wales and statehood. A match between Brisbane and Ipswich was held in 1859 while in 1860 a Toowoomba team played Dalby. By 1862 there were also teams in Warwick, Maryborough, Gayndah, Gympie, Rockhampton and the Lockyer Valley.[1]\\r\\nQueensland's first inter-colonial (i.e. representative) match was in 1864 when their XXII was beaten by a New South Wales XI.[2] In 1875, Queensland recorded their first victory when their XVIII beat the NSW XI. That victory was a catalyst for the formation of the Queensland Cricket Association in 1876.[1] Queensland was finally granted first-class status in 1892/93, winning its inaugural first-class match against NSW in that season by 14 runs.[3] Queensland rarely played more than two inter-colonial matches per season from 1892/93, with generally one match (and often both) against New South Wales. The tyranny of distance and non-professional status of the players severely limited opportunities for more first-class competition during this period.\\r\\nThe Sheffield Shield competition commenced in 1892/93 but Queensland's initial applications for admission were refused.[2] Despite their minimal first-class exposure, Queensland still produced four Australian Test players prior to their Sheffield Shield debut, though none played more than six Tests. The first was the colourful Arthur Coningham who played his only Test in 1895. Remarkably, he took a wicket with his very first delivery[4] (it was also the first ball of the Test). He also scored Queensland's initial first-class century, 151 against NSW.[5]\\r\\n1910/11 was a very successful season as Queensland recorded three first-class wins for the first time, beating NSW home and away and Victoria in Melbourne in their only three games of the summer.[6]\\r\\nQueensland was finally admitted to the Sheffield Shield in 1926/27 and had a successful debut year, defeating NSW in their first ever Shield match and also eventual winners SA in their only meeting. Like most new teams the side struggled to maintain that level of performance and finished last in the (then) four-team competition 15 times in its first 19 seasons. However the decision to include Queensland quickly paid off with the emergence of regular Test players such as Bill Brown, Don Tallon, Percy Hornibrook and Ron Oxenham. Brisbane hosted its first Test match in 1928/29 when Australia met England at the Exhibition Ground.\\r\\nBy the early 1950s Queensland had a very competitive side and was regularly finishing in the top three of the (now) five team Shield following Western Australia's admission in 1946/47. In 1956/57 they finished an agonising one point behind winners NSW.[7] More Australian players were produced, including Ron Archer, Wally Grout, Ken 'Slasher' Mackay and Peter Burge. Another highlight of this period was the dramatic Tied Test between Australia and the West Indies at the Gabba in 1960/61.\\r\\nThis period was undoubtedly Queensland's worst era, finishing last eight times in nine Shield seasons. Rock bottom was reached in 1967/68 when the side failed to win a single game. The QCA decided to recruit high-profile interstate players to revive the team's fortunes. Greg Chappell was vice-captain of South Australia under brother Ian and was lured north for the 1973/74 season with the promise of the Queensland captaincy. Emerging pace bowler Jeff Thomson followed the next year.\\r\\nThe addition of Chappell and Thomson to a side containing players such as Sam Trimble, Martin Kent, Tony Dell and Geoff Dymock had an immediate impact. Queensland gained four seconds and a third over the next five seasons, as well as winning the domestic one day cup in 1975/76, Queensland's first piece of silverware.\\r\\nThe Queensland teams of the 1980s were even stronger, featuring many outstanding cricketers, both \\"home-grown\\" like Craig McDermott, Carl Rackemann and Ian Healy and others attracted from interstate or overseas such as Vivian Richards, Allan Border, Kepler Wessels and Ian Botham. Queensland were runners up five times in seven seasons[8] in the 1980s (including a heartbreaking one wicket loss to NSW in 1984/85), and won the one-day trophy three more times in this period, but that first Shield win was still elusive.\\r\\nThe 68-year wait finally came to an end in the 1994/95 season when Stuart Law led Queensland to their inaugural Sheffield Shield win after finishing last the previous year.\\r\\nSince their breakthrough win, Queensland has enjoyed a golden era winning the competition a further six times (including three consecutive seasons from 1999/2000 to 2001/02) and also finishing as runners-up six times. Their most recent title, a victory over the Tasmanian Tigers in 2011ÿ12 saw the Bulls win by 7 wickets in one of the most closely contested finals of recent times. Since a final was introduced to the Sheffield Shield competition in the 1982/83 cricket season the Queensland Bulls have contested 18 out of 30 finals. Since Tasmania were admitted in 1977/78, the Bulls have finished in sixth (i.e. last) just twice.\\r\\nThe primary club colour of Queensland Bulls is Maroon, which represents the state colour of Queensland. The secondary club colour is Gold, with additional contrasting colour of white.\\r\\nThe \\"Bulls\\" mascot and nickname were adopted at the commencement of the 1993/94 season.\\r\\nThe side plays most of its home games at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, generally referred to as \\"the Gabba\\", a contraction of the suburb name of Woolloongabba in which it is located. Matches are occasionally played at Allan Border Field in Albion, Brisbane and Cazaly's Stadium in Cairns. 28 first-class games and two Tests were played at the Exhibition Ground between 1893 and 1931.\\r\\nPlayers with international caps are listed in bold.\\r\\nSource(s): Cricinfo, Queensland Bulls\\r\\nQueensland has produced more than 50 players who have represented Australia in Test matches,[9] while a number of Test players from other countries have played for the team.

The name refers to the Dakota branch of the Sioux tribes which occupied the area at the time. Most of Dakota Territory was formerly part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhen Minnesota became a state in 1858, the leftover area between the Missouri River and Minnesota's western boundary fell unorganized. When the Yankton Treaty was signed later that year, ceding much of what had been Sioux Indian land to the U.S. Government, early settlers formed an unofficial provisional government and unsuccessfully lobbied for United States territory status.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree years later President-elect Abraham Lincoln's cousin-in-law, J.B.S. Todd, personally lobbied for territory status and the U.S. Congress formally created Dakota Territory. It became an organized territory on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, Dakota Territory included much of present-day Montana and Wyoming as well as all of present-day North Dakota and South Dakota and a small portion of present-day Nebraska.[citation needed]\\r\\nA small patch of land known as \\"Lost Dakota\\" existed as a remote exclave of Dakota Territory until it became part of Gallatin County, Montana Territory, in 1873.[1]\\r\\nDakota Territory was not directly involved in the American Civil War but did raise some troops to defend the settlements following the Dakota War of 1862 which triggered hostilities with the Sioux tribes of Dakota Territory. The Department of the Northwest sent expeditions into Dakota Territory in 1863, 1864 and 1865. It also established forts in Dakota Territory to protect the frontier settlements of the Territory, Iowa and Minnesota and the traffic along the Missouri River.\\r\\nFollowing the Civil War, hostilities continued with the Sioux until the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. By 1868, creation of new territories reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of the Dakotas. Territorial counties were defined in 1872, including Bottineau County, Cass County and others.\\r\\nDuring the existence of the organized territory, the population first increased very slowly and then very rapidly with the \\"Dakota Boom\\" from 1870 to 1880.[2] Because the Sioux were considered very hostile and a threat to early settlers, the white population grew slowly. Gradually, the settlers' population grew and the Sioux were not considered as severe a threat.[3]\\r\\nThe population increase can largely be attributed to the growth of the Northern Pacific Railroad. Settlers who came to the Dakota Territory were from other western territories as well as many from northern and western Europe. These included large numbers of Norwegians, Germans, Swedes, and Canadians.[4]\\r\\nCommerce was originally organized around the fur trade. Furs were carried by steamboat along the rivers to the settlements. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills in 1874 and attracted more settlers, setting off the last Sioux War. The population surge increased the demand for meat spurring expanded cattle ranching on the territory's vast open ranges. With the advent of the railroad agriculture intensified: wheat became the territory's main cash crop. Economic hardship hit the territory in the 1880s due to lower wheat prices and a drought.[5]\\r\\nThe territorial capital was Yankton from 1861 until 1883, when it was moved to Bismarck. The Dakota Territory was divided into the states of North Dakota and South Dakota on November 2, 1889. The admission of two states, as opposed to one, was done for a number of reasons. The two population centers in the territory were in the northeast and southeast corners of the territory, several hundred miles away from each other. On a national level, there was pressure from the Republican Party to admit two states to add to their political power in the Senate.[6]:100ÿ101\\r\\n Admission of new western states was a party political battleground with each party looking at how the proposed new states were likely to vote. At the beginning of 1888, the Democrats under president Grover Cleveland proposed that the four territories of Montana, New Mexico, Dakota and Washington should be admitted together. The first two were expected to vote Democratic and the latter two were expected to vote Republican so this was seen as a compromise acceptable to both parties. However, the Republicans won majorities in Congress and the Senate later that year. To head off the possibility that Congress might only admit Republican territories to statehood, the Democrats agreed to a less favorable deal in which Dakota was divided in two and New Mexico was left out altogether. Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1889 and the territories could become states in nine months time after that. However, incoming Republican president Benjamin Harrison had a problem with South Dakota; most of the territory was Sioux reservation land and the state would not be viable unless much of this land became available to settlers.[6]:100ÿ102\\r\\nThere had been previous attempts to open up the territory, but these had foundered because the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) required that 75% of Sioux adult males on the reservation had to agree to any treaty change. Most recently, a commission headed by Richard Henry Pratt in 1888 had completely failed to get the necessary signatures in the face of opposition from Sioux leaders and even government worker Elaine Goodale, later Superintendent of Indian Education for the Dakotas. The government believed that the Dawes Act (1887), which attempted to move the Indians from hunting to farming, in theory meant that they needed less land (but in reality was an economic disaster for them) and that at least half was available for sale. Congress approved an offer of $1.25 per acre for reservation land (a figure they had previously rejected as outrageously high) and $25,000 to induce the Indians to sign.[6]:pp. 97ÿ99, 102\\r\\nA new commission was appointed in April 1889 that included veteran Indian fighter general George Crook. Crook pulled out all the stops to get the Indians to sign, using a number of underhand tactics. He threatened them that if they did not sign, the land would be taken anyway and they would get nothing. This would not have been seen as an idle threat; the treaty had been ignored in the past when the Black Hills were taken from the Sioux. Crook ignored leaders like Sitting Bull and Red Cloud who opposed the sale and kept them out of the negotiations, preferring instead to deal with moderate leaders like American Horse. American Horse, however, claimed immediately afterwards that he had been tricked into signing. Crook made many personal promises (such as on reservation rations) which he had no authority to make, or ability to keep. He claimed afterwards that he had only agreed to report the concerns back to Washington. Crook lied about how many signatures he already had, giving the impression that the signature he was currently asking for would make no difference. He said that those who did not sign would not get a share of the money for the land. Crook even allowed white men who had married Sioux to sign, a dubious action given that the blood quantum laws only counted full-blood Indians as members of the tribe. By August 6, 1889, Crook had the requisite number of signatures, half the reservation land was sold, and the remainder divided among six smaller reservations.[6]:pp. 102ÿ105\\r\\nNorth Dakota and South Dakota became states simultaneously on November 2, 1889. President Harrison had the papers shuffled to obscure which one was signed first and the order went unrecorded.[7]\\r\\nDakota Territory was the setting for the syndicated western television series, Man Without a Gun, starring Rex Reason as newspaper editor Adam McLean and Mort Mills as Marshal Frank Tillman.

Like all other state constitutions, it is supreme over Virginia's laws and acts of government, though it may be superseded by the United States Constitution and U.S. federal law as per the Supremacy Clause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original Virginia Constitution of 1776 was enacted in conjunction with the Declaration of Independence by the first thirteen states of the United States of America. Virginia was an early state to adopt its own Constitution on June 29, 1776, and the document was widely influential both in the United States and abroad.[1]  In addition to frequent amendments, there have been six major subsequent revisions of the constitution (by Conventions for the constitutions of 1830, 1851, 1864, 1870, 1902, and by commission for 1971 amendments). These new constitutions have been part of, and in reaction to, periods of major regional or social upheaval in Virginia. For instance, the 1902 constitution included provisions to disfranchise African Americans, who in 1900 made up nearly 36% of the state's population.[2] They did not regain suffrage until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe preparation of the first Virginia Constitution began in early 1776, in the midst of the early events of the American Revolution. Among those who drafted the 1776 Constitution were George Mason and James Madison. Thomas Jefferson was Virginia's representative to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia at the time, and his drafts of the Virginia constitution arrived too late to be incorporated into the final document.[3]  James Madison's work on the Virginia Constitution helped him develop the ideas and skills that he would later use as one of the main architects of the United States Constitution.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1776 Constitution declared the dissolution of the rule of Great Britain over Virginia and accused England's King George III of establishing a \\"detestable and insupportable tyranny\\". It also established separation of governmental powers, with the creation of the bicameral Virginia General Assembly as the legislative body of the state and the Governor of Virginia as the \\"chief magistrate\\" or executive. The accompanying Virginia Declaration of Rights, written primarily by Mason, focuses on guarantees of basic human rights and freedoms and the fundamental purpose of government. It, in turn, served as a model for a number of other historic documents, including the United States Bill of Rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritically, the 1776 Constitution limited the right to vote primarily to property owners and men of wealth. This effectively concentrated power in the hands of the landowners and aristocracy of Southeastern Virginia.[1]  Dissatisfaction with this power structure would come to dominate Virginia's constitutional debate for almost a century.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1820s, Virginia was one of only two states that limited voting to landowners. In addition, because representation was by county rather than population, the residents of increasingly populous Western Virginia (the area that would become West Virginia in 1863) had grown discontented at their limited representation in the legislature.[5] Pressure increased until a constitutional convention was convened in 1829ÿ1830. This convention became largely a contest between eastern Virginia planters of the slaveholding elite and the less affluent yeomen farmers of Western Virginia.  Issues of representation and suffrage dominated the debate.[6] Delegates to the convention included such prominent Virginians as James Madison, James Monroe, John Tyler, and John Marshall.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe convention ultimately compromised by loosening suffrage requirements. It also reduced the number of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters in the western part of the state ended up voting against it.[8] Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the 1840 census, the majority of the white residents of the state lived in western Virginia, but they were underrepresented in the legislature because of the continued property requirement for voting; not all held sufficient property to vote. This compounded their  dissatisfaction with the apportionment scheme adopted in 1830, which was based on counties rather than population, thus giving disproportionate power to the fewer, but propertied whites who lived in the eastern part of the state and kept a grip on the legislature. As the state legislature also elected the governor and the United States senators, Western Virginians felt they had little influence on state leadership.  Their attempts to win electoral reform in the Virginia legislature were defeated each time. Some began to openly discuss the abolition of slavery or secession from the state.[9]  Ultimately, the eastern planters could not continue to ignore their discontent, and a new constitutional convention was called to resolve the continuing tensions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most significant change adopted in the 1851 Constitution was elimination of the property requirement for voting, resulting in extension of the suffrage to all white males of voting age. The 1851 Constitution established popular election for the governor, the newly created office of lieutenant governor, and all Virginia judges, rather than the election of the top two state officers by the legislature, or political appointment for judges. Because of these changes, the 1851 Virginia Constitution became known as the \\"Reform Constitution\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in 1861, the Virginia legislature voted for secession in the events leading up to the American Civil War, all of the western and several of the northern counties dissented  They set up a separate government with Francis H. Pierpont as governor. During the Civil War, this separate or \\"restored\\" government approved the creation of West Virginia as a separate state (which was admitted to the Union in 1863) and in 1864 it approved a new Constitution.[11] The constitution was the product of a divided state and government; it was the first since the original 1776 Constitution to be adopted by the legislature without a popular vote.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1864 Constitution abolished slavery in Virginia, disfranchised men who had served in the Confederate government, recognized the creation of the State of West Virginia, and adjusted the number and terms of office of the members of the Virginia Assembly.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foreword to the current Virginia Constitution does not include the 1864 Constitution in its list of previous constitutions.  It notes that the 1864 Constitution was drafted under wartime conditions and was of uncertain legal status.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the end of the Civil War, Virginia came briefly under military rule during Reconstruction, with the district commanded by John M. Schofield. Pursuant to federal Reconstruction legislation, Schofield called for a new constitutional convention to meet in Richmond from December 1867 to April 1868. In protest of freedmen's suffrage, many of Virginia's conservative whites refused to participate in voting for delegates.[14] As a result, Republicans led by Judge John Curtiss Underwood dominated the convention. Opponents called the result the \\"Underwood Constitution\\"[15] or the \\"Negro Constitution\\", as it gave freedmen suffrage.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant provisions included expanding the suffrage to all male citizens over the age of 21, which included freedmen; establishing a state public school system for the first time, with mandatory funding and attendance; and providing for judges to be elected by the General Assembly rather than by popular vote.[16] Controversy over clauses that continued the temporary disfranchisement of former Confederate government members delayed the adoption of the Constitution. An eventual compromise provided for separate voting on the disfranchisement clauses and the rest of the Constitution; the former failed to win approval.[12]  The remainder of the Underwood Constitution was ratified by a popular vote of 210,585 to 9,136, and went into effect in 1870.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late nineteenth century, white Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South. They passed Jim Crow laws establishing racial segregation in public facilities and restricting the lives of blacks.  Beginning with Mississippi in 1890, legislatures began to ratify new constitutions, amendments or electoral laws that disfranchised African-American voters, devising means such as poll taxes, literacy tests and residential requirements that passed Supreme Court review but worked against poor blacks and many poor whites. By the turn of the 20th century, six Southern states had essentially eliminated the black vote, and pressure mounted among whites in Virginia to do the same, ostensibly as a way to stop electoral fraud and corruption.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1901 constitutional convention met in this climate.  Members were focused on restricting black voting rights without violating the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or disfranchising poor whites.[18] Led by the future Senator Carter Glass, the convention created requirements that all prospective voters had to pay poll taxes or pass a literacy test administered by white registrars. An exemption was granted, in a kind of grandfather clause, for military veterans and sons of veterans, who were virtually all white. The changes effectively disfranchised black voters, though many illiterate whites were also unable to meet the new requirements. In 1900 blacks made up nearly 36 percent of the population.[2] In succeeding elections, the Virginia electorate was reduced by nearly half as a result of the changes.[19] When adjusted for the Nineteenth Amendment, voter turnout would not return to 1900 levels until 1952 within a statewide population almost twice the size. The small electorate was key to maintaining the dominant Democratic Organization in power for sixty years.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther significant provisions of the 1902 Constitution imposed racial segregation in public schools (which already existed on a de facto basis) and abolished the county court system. The Constitution provided for the creation of the State Corporation Commission to regulate the growing power of the railroads.[21]  Because of concern over African-American opposition, the convention did not honor its pledge to have the proposed constitution put to popular vote.[22]  Like the 1864 Constitution by the Loyalist government during the Civil War, the legislature adopted the 1902 Constitution without ratification by the electorate. It was in effect far longer than any previous Virginia constitution.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the Civil Rights Movement challenging the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution ÿ the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission on Constitutional Revision presented its report and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, and continued to work with them to draft a final consensus version.[25] The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 1971, additional amendments have been passed by the General Assembly and approved by the voter to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution, rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congressional statute. The voting age has been reduced to eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governors veto, and the right of the people to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed.[26] In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to unions between one man and one woman.[27] That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current Constitution of Virginia consists of twelve Articles:[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle I contains the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, including the right to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in 17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, a Victims' Rights Amendment was added to the Virginia Bill of Rights as 8-A. In Nobrega v. Commonwealth, the only case so far to interpret this amendment, the Virginia Supreme Court used the Victimss Rights Amendment to support its ruling that an alleged rape victim could not be compelled to submit to a psychiatric evaluation.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 7, 2006, Virginia voters ratified an amendment, previously approved by the General Assembly, prohibiting same-sex marriage, to be added to the Bill of Rights.[30]  This amendment also prohibits the recognition of any \\"union, partnership, or other legal status\\" between unmarried people that intends to approximate marriage or which confers the \\"rights, benefits, obligations, qualities, or effects of marriage.\\" The Virginia Attorney General issued an opinion stating that the amendment does not change the legal status of documents such as contracts, wills, or Advanced Medical Directives between unmarried people.[31]  The amendment was declared to be in violation the United States Constitution by a U.S. District Court Judge on February 13, 2014.[32]  (In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the failure to provide for same-sex marriage by any U.S. state had the effect of violating the rights of homosexuals to equal protection of law required under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second Article of the Constitution sets out the procedures and mechanisms for voting, elections and holding office. Pursuant to Section 1, any Virginia resident over age 18 may vote in state elections; the voting age was reduced from 21 by a 1972 amendment to the federal constitution.[33]  However,  1 denies the vote to people who have been determined to be mentally incompetent or anyone convicted of a felony. Disfranchising convicted felons has been found to be consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution.[34] The General Assembly, pursuant to 4, is given wide power to regulate the time place and manner of all elections.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nSection Five establishes that the only qualifications to hold office in Virginia are that a person must have been a Virginia resident for at least one year and eligible to vote. Any statute or rule requiring other qualifications is constitutionally invalid under this section.[36] But, the General Assembly can impose local residency requirements for election to local governmental bodies or for election to the Assembly in representation of particular districts.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle III has one section, confirming the principle of separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government. Unlike the U.S. federal Constitution, the Virginia Constitution explicitly provides that no branch may exercise powers that properly belong to the others.[37] Separation between the branches of government is also listed as a right of the people in 5 of Article I.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle IV establishes the basic structure and authority of the Virginia legislature. The legislative power of the state is vested in the Virginia General Assembly, which consists of the Virginia Senate and the Virginia House of Delegates. 17 of Article IV gives the legislature the power to impeach members of the executive and judicial branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original 14 of Article IV forbade the incorporation of churches, though the Virginia Commission on Constitutional Revision, in its 1969 report, had recognized that the prohibition was probably invalid. The federal district court for the Western District of Virginia ruled in April 2002 that this provision of the Virginia Constitution was in fact unconstitutional, because it violates the federal constitutional right to the free exercise of religion.[38] The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate under state law when other groups can incorporate.[39] An amendment striking the ban on church incorporation was approved by Virginia voters in November 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fifth Article similarly defines the structure and powers of the executive branch. The Governor of Virginia is invested as the chief executive, though 1 of Article V, provides that the governor may not run for successive terms. The offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general are established as supporting elected constitutional positions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constitutional powers of the governor include the ability to sign legislation, veto bills (which veto may then be overridden by a two-thirds majority of both houses of the assembly), and issue pardons.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle VI vests judicial power in the Supreme Court of Virginia, along with the subordinate courts created by the General Assembly. Judges are appointed by a majority vote in the General Assembly to terms of 12 years for Supreme Court Justices and 8 years for other judges. The Supreme Court, pursuant to 5, has the authority to make rules governing the practice of law and procedures in the courts of the commonwealth (see rules), and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is established as the administrative head of the Virginia judicial system.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle VII of the Constitution sets up the basic framework for the structure and function of local government in Virginia. Local government may be established at the town (population over 1000), city (population over 5000), county or regional government level. Article VII gives the General Assembly the power to create general laws for the organization and governing of these political subdivisions, except that regional governments cannot be created without the consent of the majority of the voters who vote on the issue in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4 establishes the constitutional offices of treasurer, sheriff, Commonwealth's Attorney, clerk of court and Commissioner of the Revenue to be elected within each city and county in Virginia.\\r\\n\\r\\nA compulsory and free primary and secondary public education for every Virginia child is the focus of Article VIII. The General Assembly is empowered to determine the funding for the educational system and apportion the cost between state and local government. A state Board of Education is established to create school divisions and effectuate the overall educational policies. Supervision of the individual schools is delegated to local school boards, provided for in 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary purpose of Article IX is to create the Virginia State Corporation Commission, which is charged with administering the laws that regulate corporations. The State Corporation Commission also issues charters for Virginia corporations and licenses to do business for foreign (non-Virginia) corporations. Section 5 of Article IX prohibits such foreign corporations from doing anything in Virginia that a Virginia corporation could not do.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle X establishes the basic structure for taxation of personal property in Virginia. Pursuant to this Article, all non-exempt real and personal property is subject to taxation at its fair market value. Section 6 sets out a lengthy list of exempt property, which includes church property, cemeteries, and non-profit school property.\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant additions to Article X include 7, a budget amendment, which became effective in 1986, and 7-A, which establishes the \\"Lottery Proceeds Fund\\", requiring that all proceeds from the lottery be set aside for educational purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\nArticle XI states that it is the general policy of the Commonwealth to preserve, protect and conserve the states natural and historic resources. The General Assembly is permitted to further these policies by entering into public-private partnerships or partnerships with federal agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2001 amendment added 4, which establishes hunting and fishing as constitutional rights of Virginians, though the legislature may enact appropriate regulations and restrictions on these rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last Article creates the mechanism for future changes to the Constitution. Any amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by a majority in each of the two legislative houses. The proposed amendment must then be held over for consideration by the succeeding elected legislature, where it must again be passed by a majority in each house. The amendment then goes on the general ballot and becomes enacted into the Constitution if approved by a majority of the voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, a two-thirds majority of both Virginia houses may call for the creation of a constitutional convention. Any revisions or amendments proposed by the constitutional convention are presented to the citizens of Virginia and become law upon approval by a majority of voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a perennial discussion over Virginias unique Constitutional status restricting its governor to one consecutive term, and its distinctive method of selecting both trial and appellate judges by state legislature, shared only with South Carolina.[40]","input":"What three offices made up virginia's representative government?"},{"output":"some thirty pilgrims","context":"The Canterbury Tales (Middle English: Tales of Caunterbury[2]) is a collection of 24 stories that runs to over 17,000 lines written in Middle English by Geoffrey Chaucer between 1387ÿ1400.[3] In 1386, Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and, three years later, Clerk of the King's work in 1389.[4] It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text, The Canterbury Tales. The tales (mostly written in verse, although some are in prose) are presented as part of a story-telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return.\\r\\nAfter a long list of works written earlier in his career, including Troilus and Criseyde, House of Fame, and Parliament of Fowls, The Canterbury Tales is near-unanimously seen as Chaucer's magnum opus. He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time, and particularly of the Church. Chaucer's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English. Although the characters are fictional, they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time. Often, such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century. For example, although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest, it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual. Structurally, the collection resembles The Decameron, which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to Italy in 1372.\\r\\nIt has been suggested that the greatest contribution of The Canterbury Tales to English literature was the popularisation of the English vernacular in mainstream literature, as opposed to French, Italian or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer's time, and several of Chaucer's contemporariesJohn Gower, William Langland, the Pearl Poet, and Julian of Norwichalso wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference.\\r\\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems, the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility.\\r\\nThe Canterbury Tales is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer's life. In the General Prologue,[5] some thirty pilgrims are introduced. According to the Prologue, Chaucer's intention was to write two stories from the perspective of each pilgrim on the way to and from their ultimate destination, St. Thomas Becket's shrine (making for a total of four stories per pilgrim). Although perhaps incomplete, The Canterbury Tales is revered as one of the most important works in English literature. It is also open to a wide range of interpretations.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question of whether The Canterbury Tales is a finished work has not been answered to date. There are 84 manuscripts and four incunable editions of the work, dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods, more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of The Prick of Conscience. This is taken as evidence of the Tales' popularity during the century after Chaucer's death.[7] Fifty-five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete, while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set.[8] The Tales vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript; many of the minor variations are due to copyists' errors, while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed. Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure.\\r\\nEven the oldest surviving manuscripts of the Tales are not Chaucer's originals. The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D (called \\"Hengwrt\\"), written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer's death. The most beautiful, on the other hand, is the Ellesmere Manuscript, a manuscript whose order and many editors have followed even down to the present day.[9][10] The first version of The Canterbury Tales to be published in print was William Caxton's 1476 edition. Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist, including one held by the British Library and one held by the Folger Shakespeare Library.\\r\\nIn 2004, Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the scrivener who worked for Chaucer as an Adam Pinkhurst. Mooney, then a professor at the University of Maine and a visiting fellow at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, said she could match Pinkhurst's signature, on an oath he signed, to his handwriting on a copy of The Canterbury Tales that might have been transcribed from Chaucer's working copy.[11]\\r\\nIn the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the Tales exists, there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed.[12][13]\\r\\nTextual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales. Some scholarly editions divide the Tales into ten \\"Fragments\\". The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation, usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character. However, between Fragments, the connection is less obvious. Consequently, there are several possible orders; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments (ultimately based on the Ellesmere order).[12] Victorians frequently used the nine \\"Groups\\", which was the order used by Walter William Skeat whose edition Chaucer: Complete Works was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century, but this order is now seldom followed.[12]\\r\\nAn alternative ordering (seen in an early manuscript containing The Canterbury Tales, the early-fifteenth century Harley MS. 7334) places Fragment VIII before VI. Fragments I and II almost always follow each other, just as VI and VII, IX and X do in the oldest manuscripts. Fragments IV and V, by contrast, vary in location from manuscript to manuscript.\\r\\nChaucer wrote in late Middle English, which has clear differences from Modern English. From philological research, we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer. Chaucer pronounced -e at the end of words, so that care was [?ka?r?], not /?k??r/ as in Modern English. Other silent letters were also pronounced, so that the word knight was [kni?t], with both the k and the gh pronounced, not /?na?t/. In some cases, vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English, because the Great Vowel Shift had not yet happened. For instance, the long e in wepyng \\"weeping\\" was pronounced as [e?], as in modern German or Italian, not as /i?/. Below is an IPA transcription of the opening lines of The Merchant's Prologue:\\r\\nAlthough no manuscript exists in Chaucer's own hand, two were copied around the time of his death by Adam Pinkhurst, a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before, giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the Tales.[16] Because the final -e sound was lost soon after Chaucer's time, scribes did not accurately copy it, and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it.[17] It has now been established, however, that -e was an important part of Chaucer's grammar, and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative.[18]\\r\\nNo other work prior to Chaucer's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage. It is obvious, however, that Chaucer borrowed portions, sometimes very large portions, of his stories from earlier stories, and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived. Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time, and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years. In 14th-century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group. The winner received a crown and, as with the winner of The Canterbury Tales, a free dinner. It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen \\"master of ceremonies\\" to guide them and organise the journey.[19] Harold Bloom suggests that the structure is mostly original, but inspired by the \\"pilgrim\\" figures of Dante and Virgil in The Divine Comedy.[20] New research suggests that the General Prologue, in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim, is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey's surviving 1381 poll-tax account of Southwark's inhabitants.[21]\\r\\nThe Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio contains more parallels to The Canterbury Tales than any other work. Like the Tales, it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken (to flee from the Black Death). It ends with an apology by Boccaccio, much like Chaucer's Retraction to the Tales. A quarter of the tales in The Canterbury Tales parallel a tale in the Decameron, although most of them have closer parallels in other stories. Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand, surmising instead that he must have merely read the Decameron at some point,[22] while a new study claims he had a copy of the Decameron and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection.[23] Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars, but a few sources are used frequently over several tales. They include poetry by Ovid, the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time (the exact one is difficult to determine), and the works of Petrarch and Dante. Chaucer was the first author to utilise the work of these last two, both Italians. Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy appears in several tales, as the works of John Gower do. Gower was a known friend to Chaucer. A full list is impossible to outline in little space, but Chaucer also, lastly, seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings, such as John Bromyard's Summa praedicantium, a preacher's handbook, and Jerome's Adversus Jovinianum.[24] Many scholars say there is a good possibility Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio.[25][26][27][incomplete short citation][28][incomplete short citation][29]\\r\\nThe Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or frame tale, a common and already long established genre of its period. Chaucer's Tales differs from most other story \\"collections\\" in this genre chiefly in its intense variation. Most story collections focused on a theme, usually a religious one. Even in the Decameron, storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day. The idea of a pilgrimage to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented, though \\"the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one\\".[30] Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety, and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms.[31]\\r\\nWhile the structure of the Tales is largely linear, with one story following another, it is also much more than that. In the General Prologue, Chaucer describes not the tales to be told, but the people who will tell them, making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral. This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his. Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class, with the Monk following the Knight. However, the Miller's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present. General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales, which are responded to by other characters in their own tales, sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed.[32]\\r\\nLastly, Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip, to the time passing as the pilgrims travel, or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury. His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told, and not on the pilgrimage itself.[33]\\r\\nThe variety of Chaucer's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms, linguistic styles, and rhetorical devices. Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity, dividing literature (as Virgil suggests) into high, middle, and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary. Another popular method of division came from St. Augustine, who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter (a Virgilian concern). Augustine divided literature into \\"majestic persuades\\", \\"temperate pleases\\", and \\"subdued teaches\\". Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker, subject, audience, purpose, manner, and occasion. Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles, showing favouritism to none.[34] He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience, but the other pilgrims within the story as well, creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities. Thus Chaucer's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover.[35]\\r\\nWith this, Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers, focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning. However, even the lowest characters, such as the Miller, show surprising rhetorical ability, although their subject matter is more lowbrow. Vocabulary also plays an important part, as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a \\"lady\\", while the lower classes use the word \\"wenche\\", with no exceptions. At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes. The word \\"pitee\\", for example, is a noble concept to the upper classes, while in the Merchant's Tale it refers to sexual intercourse. Again, however, tales such as the Nun's Priest's Tale show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group, while the Knight's Tale is at times extremely simple.[36]\\r\\nChaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales, with the exception of Sir Thopas and his prose tales. It is a decasyllable line, probably borrowed from French and Italian forms, with riding rhyme and, occasionally, a caesura in the middle of a line. His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of iambic pentameter. He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem, and four of the tales (the Man of Law's, Clerk's, Prioress', and Second Nun's) use rhyme royal.[37]\\r\\nThe Canterbury Tales was written during a turbulent time in English history. The Catholic Church was in the midst of the Western Schism and, though it was still the only Christian authority in Europe, was the subject of heavy controversy. Lollardy, an early English religious movement led by John Wycliffe, is mentioned in the Tales, which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners (sellers of indulgences, which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the Sacrament of Confession) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England. The Canterbury Tales is among the first English literary works to mention paper, a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England. Political clashes, such as the 1381 Peasants' Revolt and clashes ending in the deposing of King Richard II, further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the Tales' writing. Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to Kent to get away from events in London.[38]\\r\\nWhile some readers look to interpret the characters of The Canterbury Tales as historical figures, other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms. After analysis of Chaucer's diction and historical context, his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime. Within a number of his descriptions, his comments can appear complimentary in nature, but through clever language, the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim's actions. It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons. Instead, it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work. With an understanding of medieval society, one can detect subtle satire at work.[39]\\r\\nThe Tales reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer's England. After the Black Death, many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church. Some turned to lollardy, while others chose less extreme paths, starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy, false church relics or abuse of indulgences.[40] Several characters in the Tales are religious figures, and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious (although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions), making religion a significant theme of the work.[41]\\r\\nTwo characters, the Pardoner and the Summoner, whose roles apply the Church's secular power, are both portrayed as deeply corrupt, greedy, and abusive. Pardoners in Chaucer's day were those people from whom one bought Church \\"indulgences\\" for forgiveness of sins, who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain. Chaucer's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares.[42] Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties. Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests. Chaucer's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court, and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner.[43] In The Friar's Tale, one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil, not God.[44]\\r\\nChurchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk, the Prioress, the Nun's Priest, and the Second Nun. Monastic orders, which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world, had by Chaucer's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters. Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money, while peasants worked in their employ.[45] The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be: her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church. The Monk and the Prioress, on the other hand, while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner, fall far short of the ideal for their orders. Both are expensively dressed, show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth.[46] The Prioress's Tale is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy, a blood libel against Jews that became a part of English literary tradition.[47] The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century.[48]\\r\\nPilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society. The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem,[49] but within England Canterbury was a popular destination. Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints, believing that such relics held miraculous powers. Saint Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, had been murdered in Canterbury Cathedral by knights of Henry II during a disagreement between Church and Crown. Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death, and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination.[50] The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians' striving for heaven, despite weaknesses, disagreement, and diversity of opinion.[51]\\r\\nThe upper class or nobility, represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire, was in Chaucer's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness. Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King's Court and Christian in their actions.[52] Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them, but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability.[53] Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action, its conflicting values often degenerated into violence. Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments, which at times ended in the death of the loser. The Knight's Tale shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise. To win her, both are willing to fight to the death. Chivalry was in Chaucer's day on the decline, and it is possible that The Knight's Tale was intended to show its flaws, although this is disputed.[54] Chaucer himself had fought in the Hundred Years' War under Edward III, who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign.[55] Two tales, Sir Topas and The Tale of Melibee are told by Chaucer himself, who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story. Both tales seem to focus on the ill-effects of chivalrythe first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence.[56]\\r\\nThe Tales constantly reflect the conflict between classes. For example, the division of the three estates: the characters are all divided into three distinct classes, the classes being \\"those who pray\\" (the clergy), \\"those who fight\\" (the nobility), and \\"those who work\\" (the commoners and peasantry).[57] Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes, and some \\"quit\\" (reply to or retaliate against) other tales. Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale, as he represents the highest social class in the group. But when he is followed by the Miller, who represents a lower class, it sets the stage for the Tales to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules. Helen Cooper, as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer, call this opposition \\"the ordered and the grotesque, Lent and Carnival, officially approved culture and its riotous, and high-spirited underside.\\"[58] Several works of the time contained the same opposition.[58]\\r\\nChaucer's characters each express differentsometimes vastly differentviews of reality, creating an atmosphere of testing, empathy, and relativism.[34] As Helen Cooper says, \\"Different genres give different readings of the world: the fabliau scarcely notices the operations of God, the saint's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality, tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality, romances privilege human emotion.\\" The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the Tales as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality.[59]\\r\\nThe concept of liminality figures prominently within The Canterbury Tales.[34] A liminal space, which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual, is the transitional or transformational space between a real (secure, known, limited) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility.[60] The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience, because it centers on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process. Thus, the structure of The Canterbury Tales itself is liminal; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury, but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage. Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in The Canterbury Tales,\\r\\n\\"Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space, a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales. In this unruly place, the rules of tale telling are established, themselves to be both disordered and broken; here the tales of game and earnest, solas and sentence, will be set and interrupted. Here the sacred and profane adventure begins, but does not end. Here, the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection. The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space, through liminal rural space, to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces. The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion, and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit, in yet another kind of emotional space.\\"[61]\\r\\nLiminality is also evident in the individual tales. An obvious instance of this is the Friars Tale in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell, an entirely different one.[62] The Franklins Tale is a Breton Lai tale, which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal, but also the relation between the present and the imagined past.[63]\\r\\nIt is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to English literature was in popularising the literary use of the vernacular English, rather than French or Latin. English had, however, been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer's life, and several of Chaucer's contemporariesJohn Gower, William Langland, and the Pearl Poetalso wrote major literary works in English. It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it.[citation needed] It is interesting to note that, although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms, which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions (such as The Floure and the Leafe, which was translated by John Dryden), modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the Court of Chancery in the decades during and after his lifetime.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems (the Book of the Duchess is believed to have been written for John of Gaunt on the occasion of his wife's death in 1368), the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult to determine. Chaucer was a courtier, leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for the nobility. He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by Eustache Deschamps and by his contemporary John Gower. It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud, which is probable as this was a common activity at the time. However, it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well, since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer, rather than the speaker, of the work. Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult, since the audience is part of the story. This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader.[64]\\r\\nChaucer's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole. Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends, but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death. However, the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day. The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work. More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except The Prick of Conscience, causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status. Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts, however, is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as John Lydgate's religious and historical literature.[65]\\r\\nJohn Lydgate and Thomas Occleve were among the first critics of Chaucer's Tales, praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically. This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century. Glosses included in The Canterbury Tales manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with \\"sentence\\" and rhetoric, the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry. The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight's, as it was full of both.[66]\\r\\nThe incompleteness of the Tales led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete. Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales, showing that even early on, such additions were being created. These emendations included various expansions of the Cook's Tale, which Chaucer never finished, The Plowman's Tale, The Tale of Gamelyn, the Siege of Thebes, and the Tale of Beryn.[67]\\r\\nThe Tale of Beryn, written by an anonymous author in the 15th century, is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described. While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town, the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid, but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey. As the pilgrims turn back home, the Merchant restarts the storytelling with Tale of Beryn. In this tale, a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there. He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge. The tale comes from the French tale Brinus and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales, although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by John Urry.[68]\\r\\nJohn Lydgate wrote The Siege of Thebes in about 1420. Like the Tale of Beryn, it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury. Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer's trip and heard the stories. He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the Knight's Tale. John Lydgate's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the Tales. It was first printed as early as 1561 by John Stow, and several editions for centuries after followed suit.[69]\\r\\nThere are actually two versions of The Plowman's Tale, both of which are influenced by the story Piers Plowman, a work written during Chaucer's lifetime. Chaucer describes a Plowman in the General Prologue of his tales, but never gives him his own tale. One tale, written by Thomas Occleve, describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment. Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption, with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to John Wycliffe's ideas.[70]\\r\\nThe Tale of Gamelyn was included in an early manuscript version of the tales, Harley 7334, which is notorious for being one of the lower-quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration. It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale, although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman. Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370.[71]\\r\\nMany literary works (both fiction and non-fiction alike) have used a similar frame narrative to The Canterbury Tales as an homage. Science-fiction writer Dan Simmons wrote his Hugo Award winning novel Hyperion based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins used The Canterbury Tales as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about evolution titled The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution. His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor, each telling a tale about evolution.\\r\\nHenry Dudeney's book The Canterbury Puzzles contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer's tales.\\r\\nHistorical-mystery novelist P.C. Doherty wrote a series of novels based on The Canterbury Tales, making use of both the story frame and Chaucer's characters.\\r\\nCanadian author Angie Abdou translates The Canterbury Tales to a cross section of people, all snow-sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds, converging on a remote back-country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel The Canterbury Trail.\\r\\nThe Two Noble Kinsmen, by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, a retelling of \\"The Knight's Tale\\", was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634. In 1961, Erik Chisholm completed his opera, The Canterbury Tales. The opera is in three acts: The Wyf of Baths Tale, The Pardoners Tale and The Nuns Priests Tale. Nevill Coghill's modern English version formed the basis of a musical version that was first staged in 1964.\\r\\nA Canterbury Tale, a 1944 film jointly written and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer's tales. The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the General Prologue. The scene then makes a now-famous transition to the time of World War II. From that point on, the film follows a group of strangers, each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption, who are making their way to Canterbury together. The film's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, bells pealing and Chaucer's words again resounding. A Canterbury Tale is recognised as one of the Powell-Pressburger team's most poetic and artful films. It was produced as wartime propaganda, using Chaucer's poetry, referring to the famous pilgrimage, and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for. In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer's time and the vibrant history of England.[72]\\r\\nPier Paolo Pasolini's 1972 film The Canterbury Tales features several of the tales, some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished. The Cook's Tale, for instance, which is incomplete in the original version, is expanded into a full story, and the Friar's Tale extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell. The film includes these two tales as well as the Miller's Tale, the Summoner's Tale, the Wife of Bath's Tale, and the Merchant's Tale.[73]\\r\\nOn April 26, 1986, American radio personality Garrison Keillor opened \\"The News from Lake Wobegon\\" portion of the first live TV broadcast of his A Prairie Home Companion radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue. He commented, \\"Although those words were written more than 600 years ago, they still describe spring.\\"\\r\\nTelevision adaptations include Alan Plater's 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2: Trinity Tales. In 2003, BBC again featured modern re-tellings of selected tales.[74]\\r\\nThe Knight\\r\\nThe Squire\\r\\nThe Reeve\\r\\nThe Miller\\r\\nThe Cook\\r\\nThe Wife of Bath\\r\\nThe Franklin\\r\\nThe Shipman\\r\\nThe Manciple\\r\\nThe Merchant\\r\\nThe Clerk of Oxford\\r\\nThe Sergeant of Law\\r\\nThe Physician\\r\\nThe Parson\\r\\nThe Monk\\r\\nThe Prioress\\r\\nThe Second Nun\\r\\nThe Nun's Priest\\r\\nThe Friar\\r\\nThe Summoner\\r\\nThe Pardoner\\r\\nThe Canon Yeoman\\r\\nGeoffrey Chaucer","input":"How many characters are in the prologue of canterbury tales?"},{"output":"18 May 1974","context":"Smiling Buddha[a] (MEA designation: Pokhran-I) was the assigned code name of India's first successful nuclear bomb test on 18 May 1974.[1] The bomb was detonated on the army base, Pokhran Test Range (PTR), in Rajasthan by the Indian Army under the supervision of several key Indian generals.[2]\\r\\nPokhran-I was also the first confirmed nuclear weapons test by a nation outside the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[3] Officially, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) claimed this test was a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", but it was an accelerated nuclear programme.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia started its own nuclear programme in 1944 when Homi J. Bhabha founded the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.[4] Physicist Raja Ramanna played an essential role in nuclear weapons technology research; he expanded and supervised scientific research on nuclear weapons and was the first directing officer of the small team of scientists that supervised and carried out the test.[4]\\r\\nAfter Indian independence from the British Empire, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru authorised the development of a nuclear programme headed by Homi Bhabha. The Atomic Energy Act of 1948 focused on peaceful development.[4] India was heavily involved in the development of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but ultimately opted not to sign it.[5]\\r\\nWe must develop this atomic energy quite apart from war ÿ indeed I think we must develop it for the purpose of using it for peaceful purposes. ... Of course, if we are compelled as a nation to use it for other purposes, possibly no pious sentiments of any of us will stop the nation from using it that way.\\r\\nIn 1954, Bhabha steered the nuclear programme in the direction of weapons design and production. Two important infrastructure projects were commissioned. The first established Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai (Bombay). The other created a governmental secretariat, Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), of which Bhabha was the first secretary. From 1954 to 1959, the nuclear programme grew swiftly. By 1958, the DAE had one-third of the defence budget for research purposes.[4] In 1954, India reached a verbal understanding with Canada and the United States under the Atoms for Peace programme; Canada and the United States ultimately agreed to provide and establish the CIRUS research reactor also at Trombay. The acquisition of CIRUS was a watershed event in nuclear proliferation with the understanding between India and the United States that the reactor would be used for peaceful purposes only.[4] CIRUS was an ideal facility to develop a plutonium device, and therefore Nehru refused to accept nuclear fuel from Canada and started the programme to develop an indigenous nuclear fuel cycle.[4]\\r\\nIn July 1958, Nehru authorised \\"Project Phoenix\\" to build a reprocessing plant with a capacity of 20 tons of fuel a year ÿ a size to match the production capacity of CIRUS[clarification needed].[4] The plant used the PUREX process and was designed by the American firm Vitro International.[4] Construction of the plutonium plant began at Trombay on 27 March 1961, and it was commissioned in mid-1964.[4]\\r\\nThe nuclear programme continued to mature, and by 1960, Nehru made the critical decision to move the programme into production.[4] At about the same time, Nehru held discussions with the American firm Westinghouse Electric to construct India's first nuclear power plant in Tarapur, Maharashtra.[4] Kenneth Nichols, a US Army engineer, recalls from a meeting[6] with Nehru, \\"it was that time when Nehru turned to Bhabha and asked Bhabha for the timeline of the development of a nuclear weapon\\". Bhabha estimated he would need about a year to accomplish the task.[4]\\r\\nBy 1962, the nuclear programme was still developing, but at a slow rate. Nehru was distracted by the Sino-Indian War, during which India lost territory to China.[4] Nehru turned to the Soviet Union for help, but the Soviet Union was preoccupied with the Cuban Missile Crisis.[4] The Soviet Politburo turned down Nehru's request for arms and continued backing the Chinese.[4] India concluded that the Soviet Union was an unreliable ally, and this conclusion strengthened India's determination to create a nuclear deterrent.[4] Design work began in 1965 under Bhabha and proceeded under Raja Ramanna who took over the programme after the former's death.[4]\\r\\nBhabha was now aggressively lobbying for nuclear weapons and made several speeches on Indian radio.[7] In 1964, Bhabha told the Indian public via Indian radio that \\"such nuclear weapons are remarkably cheap\\" and supported his arguments by referring to the economical cost of American nuclear testing programme (Plowshare).[7] Bhabha stated to the politicians that a 10 kt device would cost around $350,000, and $600,000 for a 2 mt.[7] From this, he estimated that \\"a stockpile\\" of around 50 atomic bombs would cost under $21 million and a stockpile of 50 two-megaton hydrogen bombs would cost around $31.5 million.\\"[7] Bhabha did not realise, however, that the U.S. Plowshare cost-figures were produced by a vast industrial complex costing tens of billions of dollars, which had already manufactured nuclear weapons numbering in the tens of thousands.[7] The delivery systems for nuclear weapons typically cost several times as much as the weapons themselves.[7]\\r\\nThe nuclear programme was partially slowed down when Lal Bahadur Shastri became the prime minister.[8] In 1965, Shastri faced another war with Pakistan. Shastri appointed physicist Vikram Sarabhai as the head of the nuclear programme but because of his Gandhian beliefs Sarabhai directed the programme toward peaceful purposes rather than military development.[8]\\r\\nIn 1967, Indira Gandhi became the prime minister and work on the nuclear programme resumed with renewed vigour.[4] Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer, played a significant role in the development of weapon-grade plutonium while Ramanna designed and manufactured the whole nuclear device.[8] The first nuclear bomb project did not employ more than 75 scientists because of its sensitivity.[8] The nuclear weapons programme was now directed towards the production of plutonium rather than uranium.[9]\\r\\nIn 1968ÿ69, P. K. Iyengar visited the Soviet Union with three colleagues and toured the nuclear research facilities at Dubna, Russia.[9] During his visit, Iyengar was impressed by the plutonium-fueled pulsed fast reactor.[9] Upon his return to India, Iyengar set about developing plutonium reactors approved by the Indian political leadership in January 1969.[9] The secret plutonium plant was known as Purnima,[10] and construction began in March 1969. The plant's leadership included Iyengar, Ramanna, Homi Sethna, and Sarabhai. Sarabhai's presence indicates that, with or without formal approval, the work on nuclear weapons at Trombay had been commenced.[9]\\r\\nIndia continued to harbour ambivalent feelings about nuclear weapons, and accorded low priority to their production until the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. In December 1971, Richard Nixon sent a carrier battle group led by the USS?Enterprise?(CVN-65) into the Bay of Bengal in an attempt to intimidate India. The Soviet Union responded by sending a submarine armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok to trail the US task force. The Soviet response demonstrated the deterrent value and significance of nuclear weapons and ballistic missile submarines to Indira Gandhi.[11] India gained the military and political initiative over Pakistan after acceding to the treaty that divided Pakistan into two different political entities.[9]\\r\\nOn 7 September 1972, near the peak of her post-war popularity, Indira Gandhi authorised the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) to manufacture a nuclear device and prepare it for a test.[5] Although the Indian Army was not fully involved in the nuclear testing, the army's highest command was kept fully informed of the test preparations.[9] The preparations were carried out under the watchful eyes of the Indian political leadership, with civilian scientists assisting the Indian Army.[2]\\r\\nThe device was formally called the \\"Peaceful Nuclear Explosive\\", but it was usually referred to as the Smiling Buddha.[2] The device was detonated on 18 May 1974, Buddha Jayanti (a festival day in India marking the birth of Gautama Buddha).[12] Indira Gandhi maintained tight control of all aspects of the preparations of the Smiling Buddha test, which was conducted in extreme secrecy; besides Gandhi, only advisers Parmeshwar Haksar and Durga Dhar were kept informed.[2] Scholar Raj Chengappa asserts the Indian Defence Minister Jagjivan Ram was not provided with any knowledge of this test and came to learn of it only after it was conducted.[13] Swaran Singh, the Minister of External Affairs, was given 48 hours advance notice.[14] The Indira Gandhi administration employed no more than 75 civilian scientists while General G. G. Bewoor, Indian army chief, and the commander of Indian Western Command were the only military commanders kept informed.[2]\\r\\nThe head of this entire nuclear bomb project was the director of the BARC, Raja Ramanna. In later years, his role in the nuclear programme would be more deeply integrated as he remained head of the nuclear programme most of his life. The designer and creator of the bomb was P. K. Iyengar, who was the second in command of this project. Iyengar's work was further assisted by the chief metallurgist, R. Chidambaram, and by Nagapattinam Sambasiva Venkatesan of the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, who developed and manufactured the high explosive implosion system. The explosive materials and the detonation system were developed by Waman Dattatreya Patwardhan of the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory.\\r\\nThe overall project was supervised by chemical engineer Homi Sethna, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. Chidambaram, who would later coordinate work on the Pokhran-II tests, began work on the equation of state of plutonium in late 1967 or early 1968. To preserve secrecy, the project employed no more than 75 scientists and engineers from 1967ÿ74.[5][15] It is theorised that Abdul Kalam also arrived at the test site as the representative of the DRDO, although he had no role whatsoever in the development of the nuclear bomb or even in the nuclear programme.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe device was of the implosion-type design and had a close resemblance to the American nuclear bomb called the Fat Man.[2] The implosion system was assembled at the Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) of the DRDO in Chandigarh.[2] The detonation system was developed at the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) of the DRDO in Pune, Maharashtra State.[2] The 6?kg of plutonium came from the CIRUS reactor at BARC.[2] The neutron initiator was of the poloniumÿberyllium type and code-named Flower. The complete nuclear bomb was engineered and finally assembled by Indian engineers at Trombay before transportation to the test site.[2]\\r\\nThe fully assembled device had a hexagonal cross section, 1.25 metres in diameter, and weighed 1400?kg.[2] The device was mounted on a hexagonal metal tripod, and was transported to the shaft on rails which the army kept covered with sand.[2] The device was detonated when Dastidar pushed the firing button at 8.05 a.m.; it was in a shaft 107 m under the army Pokhran test range in the Thar Desert (or Great Indian Desert), Rajasthan.[2] Coordinates of the crater are 270542N 714511E? / ?27.095N 71.753E? / 27.095; 71.753Coordinates: 270542N 714511E? / ?27.095N 71.753E? / 27.095; 71.753.\\r\\nThe nuclear yield of this test still remains controversial, with unclear data provided by Indian sources, although Indian politicians have given the country's press a range from 2?kt to 20?kt.[2] The official yield was initially set at 12?kt; post-Operation Shakti claims have raised it to 13?kt.[2] Independent seismic data from outside and analysis of the crater features indicate a lower figure.[2] Analysts usually estimate the yield at 4 to 6?kt, using conventional seismic magnitude-to-yield conversion formulas. In recent years, both Homi Sethna and P. K. Iyengar have conceded the official yield to be an exaggeration.[2]\\r\\nIyengar has variously stated that the yield was 8ÿ10?kt, that the device was designed to yield 10?kt, and that the yield was 8?kt \\"exactly as predicted\\". Although seismic scaling laws lead to an estimated yield range between 3.2 kt and 21 kt,[16] an analysis of hard rock cratering effects suggests a narrow range of around 8?kt for the yield,[2] which is within the uncertainties of the seismic yield estimate.[16]\\r\\nIndian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had already gained much popularity and publicity after her successful military campaign against Pakistan in the 1971 war.[17] The test caused an immediate revival of Indira Gandhi's popularity, which had flagged considerably from its high after the 1971 war. The overall popularity and image of the Congress Party was enhanced and the Congress Party was well received in the Indian Parliament.[17] In 1975, Homi Sethna, a chemical engineer and the chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission (AECI), Raja Ramanna of BARC, and Basanti Nagchaudhuri of DRDO, all were honoured with the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award.[17] Five other project members received the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian award.[17] India consistently maintained that this was a peaceful nuclear bomb test and that it had no intentions of militarising its nuclear programme. However, according to independent monitors, this test was part of an accelerated Indian nuclear programme.[1] In 1997 Raja Ramanna, speaking to the Press Trust of India, maintained:\\r\\nThe Pokhran test was a bomb, I can tell you now.... An explosion is an explosion, a gun is a gun, whether you shoot at someone or shoot at the ground.... I just want to make clear that the test was not all that peaceful.\\r\\nWhile India continued to state that the test was for peaceful purposes, it encountered opposition from many quarters. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was formed in reaction to the Indian tests to check international nuclear proliferation.[18] The NSG decided in 1992 to require full-scope IAEA safeguards for any new nuclear export deals,[19] which effectively ruled out nuclear exports to India, but in 2008 it waived this restriction on nuclear trade with India as part of the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement.[20]\\r\\nPakistan did not view the test as a \\"peaceful nuclear explosion\\", and cancelled talks scheduled for 10 June on normalisation of relations.[5] Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto vowed in June 1974 that he would never succumb to \\"nuclear blackmail\\" or accept \\"Indian hegemony or domination over the subcontinent\\".[21] The chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, Munir Ahmed Khan, said that the test would force Pakistan to test its own nuclear bomb.[22] Pakistan's leading nuclear physicist, Pervez Hoodbhoy, stated in 2011 that he believed the test \\"pushed [Pakistan] further into the nuclear arena\\".[23]\\r\\nThe plutonium used in the test was created in the CIRUS reactor supplied by Canada and using heavy water supplied by the United States. Both countries reacted negatively, especially in light of then ongoing negotiations on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the economic aid both countries had provided to India.[5][24] Canada concluded that the test violated a 1971 understanding between the two states, and froze nuclear energy assistance for the two heavy water reactors then under construction.[5] The United States concluded that the test did not violate any agreement and proceeded with a June 1974 shipment of enriched uranium for the Tarapur reactor.[5]\\r\\nFrance sent a congratulatory telegram to India but later withdrew it.[25]\\r\\nDespite many proposals, India did not carry out further nuclear tests until 1998. After the 1998 general elections, Operation Shakti (also known as Pokhran-II) was carried out at the Pokhran test site, using devices designed and built over the preceding two decades.[5][26]","input":"When did india conduct it's first nuclear test at pokhran?"},{"output":"February 2011","context":"Next Generation Identification (NGI) is a project of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.[3]\\r\\nNatural gas is a fossil fuel used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. It is also used as fuel for vehicles and as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals. Fossil fuel based natural gas is a non-renewable resource.[3]\\r\\nNatural gas is found in deep underground rock formations or associated with other hydrocarbon reservoirs in coal beds and as methane clathrates. Petroleum is another resource and fossil fuel found in close proximity to and with natural gas. Most natural gas was created over time by two mechanisms: biogenic and thermogenic. Biogenic gas is created by methanogenic organisms in marshes, bogs, landfills, and shallow sediments. Deeper in the earth, at greater temperature and pressure, thermogenic gas is created from buried organic material.[4][5]\\r\\nIn petroleum production gas is often burnt as flare gas. The World Bank estimates that over 150 cubic kilometers of natural gas are flared or vented annually.[6] Before natural gas can be used as a fuel, most, but not all, must be processed to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include: ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen.\\r\\nNatural gas is often informally referred to simply as \\"gas\\", especially when compared to other energy sources such as oil or coal. However, it is not to be confused with gasoline, especially in North America, where the term gasoline is often shortened in colloquial usage to gas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural gas was discovered accidentally in ancient China, as it resulted from the drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt.[7] Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE[8]). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to extract the salt,[9] in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan.[10] The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825.[11] By 2009, 66 000?km3 (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000?km3 of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas.[12] Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400?km3 of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2ÿ3% could result in currently recoverable reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.[12]\\r\\nIn the 19th century, natural gas was usually obtained as a by-product of producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If there was not a market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user.\\r\\nIn the 19th century and early 20th century, unwanted gas was usually burned off at oil fields. Today, unwanted gas (or stranded gas without a market) associated with oil extraction often is returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to repressurize the formation, which can enhance extraction rates from other wells. In regions with a high natural gas demand (such as the US), pipelines are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an end consumer.\\r\\nIn addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including FischerÿTropsch (FÿT), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. FÿT produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process.[13] In 2011, Royal Dutch Shell's 140,000 barrel (16 dam3) per day FÿT plant went into operation in Qatar.\\r\\nNatural gas can be \\"associated\\" (found in oil fields), or \\"non-associated\\" (isolated in natural gas fields), and is also found in coal beds (as coalbed methane).[14] It sometimes contains a significant amount of ethane, propane, butane, and pentaneheavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the methane being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock. Non-hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium (rarely), and hydrogen sulfide must also be removed before the natural gas can be transported.[15]\\r\\nNatural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas (whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet) or associated gas. The natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging resource types: sour gas, tight gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane.\\r\\nThere is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves. Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US CIA (47 600?km3),[16] the US Energy Information Administration (47 800?km3),[17] and OPEC (48 700?km3).[18] However, BP credits Russia with only 32 900?km3,[19] which would place it in second place, slightly behind Iran (33 100 to 33 800?km3, depending on the source). With Gazprom, Russia is frequently the world's largest natural gas extractor. Major proven resources (in cubic kilometers) are world 187 300 (2013), Iran 33 600 (2013), Russia 32 900 (2013), Qatar 25 100 (2013), Turkmenistan 17 500 (2013) and the United States 8500 (2013).\\r\\nIt is estimated that there are about 900 000?km3 of \\"unconventional\\" gas such as shale gas, of which 180 000?km3 may be recoverable.[20] In turn, many studies from MIT, Black & Veatch and the DOE predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future.[21]\\r\\nThe world's largest gas field is the offshore South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field, shared between Iran and Qatar. It is estimated to have 51 000 cubic kilometers of natural gas and 50 billion barrels (6?km3) of natural gas condensates.\\r\\nBecause natural gas is not a pure product, as the reservoir pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizingan effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.\\r\\nShale gas is natural gas produced from shale. Because shale has matrix permeability too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities, shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow. Early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed; almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by hydraulic fracturing. Since 2000, shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the United States and Canada.[22] Following the success in the United States, shale gas exploration is beginning in countries such as Poland, China, and South Africa.[23][24][25] Because of this increase in shale production, the United States is now the number one natural gas producer in the world[26]\\r\\nTown gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of coal. It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\\r\\nMost town \\"gashouses\\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The coal tar (or asphalt) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\\r\\nMethanogenic archaea are responsible for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, biogas, and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these are referred to as biogas (or natural biogas). Sources of biogas include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure[27] by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. Biogas can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\\r\\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3 per cent CO2, and a few parts per million H\\r\\n2S, because CO2 and H\\r\\n2S corrode the pipelines.[28] The presence of CO2 will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.[clarification needed] Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site. If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, siloxanes can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet emission standards, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.\\r\\nBiogas, and especially landfill gas, are already used in some areas, but their use could be greatly expanded. Experimental systems were being proposed[when?] for use in parts of Hertfordshire, UK, and Lyon in France.[citation needed] Using materials that would otherwise generate no income, or even cost money to get rid of, improves the profitability and energy balance of biogas production. Gas generated in sewage treatment plants is commonly used to generate electricity. For example, the Hyperion sewage plant in Los Angeles burns 8?million cubic feet (230,000?m3) of gas per day to generate power[29] New York City utilizes gas to run equipment in the sewage plants, to generate electricity, and in boilers.[30] Using sewage gas to make electricity is not limited to large cities. The city of Bakersfield, California, uses cogeneration at its sewer plants.[31] California has 242 sewage wastewater treatment plants, 74 of which have installed anaerobic digesters. The total biopower generation from the 74 plants is about 66 MW.[32]\\r\\nHuge quantities of natural gas (primarily methane) exist in the form of hydrates under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience permafrost, such as those in Siberia. Hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form.\\r\\nIn 2010, the cost of extracting natural gas from crystallized natural gas was estimated to be as much as twice the cost of extracting natural gas from conventional sources, and even higher from offshore deposits.[34]\\r\\nIn 2013, Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) announced that they had recovered commercially relevant quantities of natural gas from methane hydrate.[35]\\r\\nThe image below is a schematic block flow diagram of a typical natural gas processing plant. It shows the various unit processes used to convert raw natural gas into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets.\\r\\nThe block flow diagram also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur, byproduct ethane, and natural gas liquids (NGL) propane, butanes and natural gasoline (denoted as pentanes +).[36][37][38][39][40]\\r\\nNatural gas production in the US reached a peak in 1973, and went over a second lower peak in 2001, but recently has peaked again and is continuing to rise.[41] [42]\\r\\nNatural gas is primarily used in the northern hemisphere. North America and Europe are major consumers.\\r\\nNatural gas flowing in the distribution lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050?BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.\\r\\nOften mid-stream and well head gases require removal of many of the various hydrocarbon species contained within the natural gas. Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate the natural gas engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050?BTU per cubic foot to operate at the natural gas engines rotational name plate specifications.\\r\\nSeveral methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use at the natural gas engine. A few technologies are as follows:\\r\\nNatural gas is a major source of electricity generation through the use of cogeneration, gas turbines and steam turbines. Natural gas is also well suited for a combined use in association with renewable energy sources such as wind or solar[44] and for alimenting peak-load power stations functioning in tandem with hydroelectric plants. Most grid peaking power plants and some off-grid engine-generators use natural gas. Particularly high efficiencies can be achieved through combining gas turbines with a steam turbine in combined cycle mode. Natural gas burns more cleanly than other hydrocarbon fuels, such as oil and coal, and produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy released. For transportation, burning natural gas produces about 30 percent less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum. For an equivalent amount of heat, burning natural gas produces about 45 percent less carbon dioxide than burning coal for power.[45] The US Energy Information Administration reports the following emissions in million metric tons of carbon dioxide in the world for 2012:[46]\\r\\nCoal-fired electric power generation emits around 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour generated, which is almost double the carbon dioxide released by a natural gas-fired electric plant per megawatt hour generated.[47] Because of this higher carbon efficiency of natural gas generation, as the fuel mix in the United States has changed to reduce coal and increase natural gas generation, carbon dioxide emissions have unexpectedly fallen. Those measured in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest of any recorded for the first quarter of any year since 1992.[48]\\r\\nCombined cycle power generation using natural gas is currently the cleanest available source of power using hydrocarbon fuels, and this technology is widely and increasingly used as natural gas can be obtained at increasingly reasonable costs. Fuel cell technology may eventually provide cleaner options for converting natural gas into electricity, but as yet it is not price-competitive. Locally produced electricity and heat using natural gas powered Combined Heat and Power plant (CHP or Cogeneration plant) is considered energy efficient and a rapid way to cut carbon emissions.[49]\\r\\nNatural gas generated power has increased from 740 TW in 1973 to 5140 TW in 2014, generating 22% of the worlds total electricity. Approximately half as much as generated with coal.[50] Efforts around the world to reduce the use of coal has led some regions to switch to natural gas.\\r\\nNatural gas dispensed in a residential setting can generate temperatures in excess of 1100?C (2000?F) making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel.[51] In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes, where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens, gas-heated clothes dryers, heating/cooling, and central heating. Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers, furnaces, and water heaters. Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas. Boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 inches of water (6\\" to 7\\" WC), which is about 0.25 psig. The pressures in the supply lines under the streets vary, either utilization pressure (UP, the aforementioned 6\\" to 7\\" WC) or elevated pressure (EP), which may be anywhere from 1 psig to 120 psig. Systems using EP have a regulator at the service entrance to step down the pressure to UP.\\r\\nIn the US Compressed natural gas (CNG) is used in rural homes without connections to piped-in public utility services, or with portable grills.[citation needed] Natural gas is also supplied by independent natural gas suppliers through Natural Gas Choice programs throughout the United States. However, as CNG costs more than LPG, LPG (propane) is the dominant source of rural gas.\\r\\nCNG is a cleaner and also cheaper alternative to other automobile fuels such as gasoline (petrol) and diesel. By the end of 2012 there were 17.25 million natural gas vehicless worldwide, led by Iran (3.3 million), Pakistan (3.1 million), Argentina (2.18 million), Brazil (1.73 million), India (1.5 million), and China (1.5 million).[52] The energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines, but lower compared with modern diesel engines. Gasoline/petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines, resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas (10%ÿ15%). CNG-specific engines, however, use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel's higher octane number of 120ÿ130.[53] [54]\\r\\nBesides use in road vehicles, CNG can also be used in aircraft. Compressed natural gas has been used in some aircraft like the Aviat Aircraft Husky 200 CNG[55][56][57] and the Chromarat VX-1 KittyHawk[58]\\r\\nLNG is also being used in aircraft. Russian aircraft manufacturer Tupolev for instance is running a development program to produce LNG- and hydrogen-powered aircraft.[59] The program has been running since the mid-1970s, and seeks to develop LNG and hydrogen variants of the Tu-204 and Tu-334 passenger aircraft, and also the Tu-330 cargo aircraft. It claims that at current market prices, an LNG-powered aircraft would cost 5,000 roubles (~ US$218/ S112) less to operate per ton, roughly equivalent to 60 per cent, with considerable reductions to carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions.\\r\\nThe advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency, in effect replacing an intercooler. Alternatively, it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust.\\r\\nNatural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia, via the Haber process, for use in fertilizer production.\\r\\nNatural gas can be used to produce hydrogen, with one common method being the hydrogen reformer. Hydrogen has many applications: it is a primary feedstock for the chemical industry, a hydrogenating agent, an important commodity for oil refineries, and the fuel source in hydrogen vehicles.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural gas is also used in the manufacture of fabrics, glass, steel, plastics, paint, and other products.[60][61]\\r\\nBecause of its low density, it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle. Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans, since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed, as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up. Many existing pipelines in America are close to reaching their capacity, prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages. The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated, causing significant price differences across countries. In Western Europe, the gas pipeline network is already dense.[62] New pipelines are planned or under construction in Eastern Europe and between gas fields in Russia, Near East and Northern Africa and Western Europe. See also List of natural gas pipelines.\\r\\nWhenever gas is bought or sold at custody transfer points, rules and agreements are made regarding the gas quality. These may include the maximum allowable concentration of CO2, H2S and H2O. Usually sales quality gas that has been treated to remove contamination is traded on a \\"dry gas\\" basis and is required to be commercially free from objectionable odours, materials, and dust or other solid or liquid matter, waxes, gums and gum forming constituents, which might damage or adversely affect operation of equipment downstream of the custody transfer point.\\r\\nLNG carriers transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) across oceans, while tank trucks can carry liquefied or compressed natural gas (CNG) over shorter distances. Sea transport using CNG carrier ships that are now under development may be competitive with LNG transport in specific conditions.\\r\\nGas is turned into liquid at a liquefaction plant, and is returned to gas form at regasification plant at the terminal. Shipborne regasification equipment is also used. LNG is the preferred form for long distance, high volume transportation of natural gas, whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to 4,000?km (2,485?mi) over land and approximately half that distance offshore.\\r\\nCNG is transported at high pressure, typically above 200 bars. Compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefaction/regasification plants. Natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end-users, or to distribution points such as pipelines.\\r\\nIn the past, the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold, and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring. Flaring is now illegal in many countries.[63] Additionally, higher demand in the last 20ÿ30 years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable. As a further option, the gas is now sometimes re-injected into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding. Conservation, re-injection, or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets (pipelines), and regulatory restrictions.\\r\\nNatural gas can be indirectly exported through the absorption in other physical output. A recent study suggests that the expansion of shale gas production in the US has caused prices to drop relative to other countries. This has caused a boom in energy intensive manufacturing sector exports, whereby the average dollar unit of US manufacturing exports has almost tripled its energy content between 1996 and 2012.[64]\\r\\nA \\"master gas system\\" was invented in Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s, ending any necessity for flaring. Satellite observation, however, shows that flaring[65] and venting[66] are still practiced in some gas-extracting countries.\\r\\nNatural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for desalination. Similarly, some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity.\\r\\nNatural gas is often stored underground inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells, salt domes, or in tanks as liquefied natural gas. The gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up. Storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands, but such storage may not always be practicable.\\r\\nWith 15 countries accounting for 84 per cent of the worldwide extraction, access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics, and countries vie for control of pipelines.[67] In the first decade of the 21st century, Gazprom, the state-owned energy company in Russia, engaged in disputes with Ukraine and Belarus over the price of natural gas, which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of Europe could be cut off for political reasons.[68] The United States is preparing to export natural gas.[69]\\r\\nFloating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped because due to environmental or economic factors it is nonviable to develop them via a land-based LNG operation. FLNG technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages:\\r\\nMany gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG). There are currently projects underway to construct five FLNG facilities. Petronas is close to completion on their FLNG-1[72] at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering and are underway[73] on their FLNG-2 project at Samsung Heavy Industries. Shell Prelude is due to start production 2017 and the Browse LNG project has completed FEED with final investment decisions expected in mid-2016.[74]\\r\\nNatural gas is mainly composed of methane. After release to the atmosphere it is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals ({OH) formed in the troposphere or stratosphere, giving the overall chemical reaction CH4 + 2O2L CO2 + 2H2O.[75][76] While the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide,[77] with a half-life of about 7 years, it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere, so that a given quantity of methane has 84 times the global-warming potential of carbon dioxide over a 20-year period and 28 times over a 100-year period. Natural gas is thus a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide due to the greater global-warming potential of methane.[78] But because when it is burned, it produces more water than carbon dioxide by mole, in contrast to coal which produces mainly carbon dioxide, it produces only about half the carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour that coal does. Current estimates by the EPA place global emissions of methane at 85?billion cubic metres (3.0G10^12?cu?ft) annually,[77] or 3.2 per cent of global production.[79] Direct emissions of methane represented 14.3 per cent by volume of all global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2004.[80]\\r\\nDuring extraction, storage, transportation, and distribution, natural gas is known to leak into the atmosphere, particularly during the extraction process. A Cornell University study in 2011 demonstrated that the leak rate of methane may be high enough to jeopardize its global warming advantage over coal.[81] This study was criticized later for its over-estimation of methane leakage values.[82] Preliminary results of some air sampling from airplanes done by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated higher-than-estimated methane releases by gas wells in some areas,[83] but the overall results showed methane emissions in line with previous EPA estimates[84]\\r\\nNatural gas extraction also releases an isotope of radon, ranging in activity from 5 to 200,000 becquerels per cubic meter of gas.[85]\\r\\nNatural gas is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel. It produces about 29% and 44% less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than oil and coal respectively,[45] and potentially fewer pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels.[86] However, in absolute terms, it comprises a substantial percentage of human carbon emissions, and this contribution is projected to grow. According to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, in 2004, natural gas produced about 5.3 billion tons a year of CO2 emissions, while coal and oil produced 10.6 and 10.2 billion tons respectively. According to an updated version of the Special Report on Emissions Scenario by 2030, natural gas would be the source of 11 billion tons a year, with coal and oil now 8.4 and 17.2 billion respectively because demand is increasing 1.9 percent a year.\\r\\nNatural gas produces far lower amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides than other fossil fuels.[87] The other pollutants due to natural gas combustion are listed below[86][88] in pounds per billion BTU:\\r\\nSome gas fields yield sour gas containing hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This untreated gas is toxic. Amine gas treating, an industrial scale process which removes acidic gaseous components, is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas.[89]\\r\\nExtraction of natural gas (or oil) leads to decrease in pressure in the reservoir. Such decrease in pressure in turn may result in subsidence, sinking of the ground above. Subsidence may affect ecosystems, waterways, sewer and water supply systems, foundations, and so on.[90]\\r\\nReleasing natural gas from subsurface porous rock formations may be accomplished by a process called hydraulic fracturing or \\"fracking\\". It's estimated that hydraulic fracturing will eventually account for nearly 70% of natural gas development in North America.[91] Since the first commercial hydraulic fracturing operation in 1949, approximately one million wells have been hydraulically fractured in the United States.[92] The production of natural gas from hydraulically fractured wells has utilized the technological developments of directional and horizontal drilling, which improved access to natural gas in tight rock formations.[93] Strong growth in the production of unconventional gas from hydraulically fractured wells occurred between 2000-2012.[94]\\r\\nIn hydraulic fracturing, well operators force water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or \\"fracks\\" the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the \\"frack,\\" oil or gas is extracted and nearly 30 percent to 70 percent of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.[95]\\r\\nThe volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique. In the United States, the average volume of water used per hydraulic fracture has been reported as nearly 7,375 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells prior to 1953, nearly 197,000 gallons for vertical oil and gas wells between 2000-2010, and nearly 3 million gallons for horizontal gas wells between 2000-2010.[96]\\r\\nDetermining which fracking technique is appropriate for well productivity depends largely on the properties of the reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas. If the rock is characterized by low-permeability  which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas.[97] Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas, involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally.[98] In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required.[99][100] The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.[101][102][103][104][105]\\r\\nThe US EPA has acknowledged that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, have been used as gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF).[106] Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF, the water, chemicals, and frack fluid that return to the well's surface, called flowback or produced water, may contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, natural salts, and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations.[107] Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they're mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle.[108]\\r\\nIn order to assist in detecting leaks, an odorizer is added to the otherwise colorless and almost odorless gas used by consumers. The odor has been compared to the smell of rotten eggs, due to the added tert-Butylthiol (t-butyl mercaptan). Sometimes a related compound, thiophane, may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry. This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.[109]\\r\\nExplosions caused by natural gas leaks occur a few times each year. Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure. Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing. In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries. Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process. The gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough. However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\\r\\nNatural gas heating systems may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).[110]\\r\\nQuantities of natural gas are measured in normal cubic meters (corresponding to 0?C at 101.325 kPa) or in standard cubic feet (corresponding to 60?F (16?C) and 14.73 psia). The gross heat of combustion of 1?m3 of commercial quality natural gas is around 39?MJ (10.8?kWh), but this can vary by several percent. This comes to about 49?MJ (13.5?kWh) for 1?kg of natural gas (assuming a density of 0.8?kg m?3, an approximate value).[citation needed]\\r\\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1,000 cubic feet (28?m3) ($10/MMBTU).[111] The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12ÿ$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3).[112] Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000?MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU. Thus, if the price of gas is $10 per million BTUs on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\\r\\nGas prices for end users vary greatly across the EU.[113] A single European energy market, one of the key objectives of the EU, should level the prices of gas in all EU member states. Moreover, it would help to resolve supply and global warming issues,[114] as well as strengthen relations with other Mediterranean countries and foster investments in the region.[115]\\r\\nIn US units, one standard cubic foot 1 cubic foot (28?L) of natural gas produces around 1,028 British thermal units (1,085?kJ). The actual heating value when the water formed does not condense is the net heat of combustion and can be as much as 10% less.[116]\\r\\nIn the United States, retail sales are often in units of therms (th); 1 therm = 100,000?BTU. Gas meters measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms (Dth), or in thousand decatherms (MDth), or in million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas. Gas sales to domestic consumers may be in units of 100 standard cubic feet (scf). The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one RCE.\\r\\nCanada uses metric measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule, cubic metre (m3) or thousand cubic metres (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic metre). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m3 or ft3), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\\r\\nA gigajoule (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250?lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or 1000?cu ft of gas, or 28?m3 of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from 37 to 43 MJ per m3 depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\\r\\nIn the rest of the world, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) are traded in metric tons or MMBTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic metres, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes (1,000?kg). The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships, as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\\r\\nIn the Russian Federation, Gazprom sold approximately 250 billion cubic metres of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 the Group produced 487.4 billion cubic meters of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with 161.5 billion cubic meters of gas in 2013.\\r\\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a \\"supergiant\\" gas field in the Mediterranean Sea covering about 40 square miles. It was also reported that the gas field could hold a potential 30 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. ENI said that it is about the energy equivalent of 5.5 billion barrels of oil. The field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.[117]\\r\\nResearch conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC)[when?] suggests that large US and Canadian pension funds and Asian and MENA area SWF investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, a trend started in 2005 by the formation of Scotia Gas Networks in the UK by OMERS and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.[citation needed]\\r\\nAnother way to store natural gas is adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The best condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The used pressure can be up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) for having more storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC). Three main types of activated carbons for ANG are: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), activated carbon monolith.[118]\\r\\nGeneral:","input":"What types of gasses make up natural gas?"},{"output":"on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively","context":"","input":"When did the atomic bomb drop on hiroshima and nagasaki?"},{"output":"Indian flag carrier airline Air India","context":"Air India Express is an Indian low-cost carrier headquartered in Kochi.

They are the 179th and 180th episodes of the show and the 23rd and 24th episodes of the ninth season. It aired on NBC May 14, 1998 to an audience of 76 million viewers. Its initial running time was 1 hour and 15 minutes.[1]\\r\\nThe fake working title for this show was \\"A Tough Nut to Crack\\" to throw off outsiders about the contents of the episode.[2] For the first and final time since season seven, Jerry performs a stand-up comedy routine. Larry David, co-creator of the series, returned to write the script for this episode.\\r\\nThe episode garnered strongly divided responses upon airing, and continues to polarize critics and audiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nJerry and George have finally struck a deal with NBC to produce their pilot Jerry as a series, upon receiving a call from Elizabeth Clark calling from the office of NBC President James Kimbrough (Peter Riegert). Jerry and George will be leaving New York City for California to begin work. Jerry is given use of NBC's private jet by NBC executives Jay Crespi and Stu Chermak as a courtesy and he, George, Elaine, and Kramer decide to go to Paris for \\"one last hurrah\\". Elaine tries to get hold of her friend Jill. First, she can't get any reception with her cell phone on the street. Then, Jerry interrupts her with news of the pilot pickup and Elaine hangs up on Jill to take the call. Jerry then scolds her for trying to rush the call before they all leave for Paris, and for thinking about calling from the plane. On the plane that is piloted by Captain Mattox and his co-pilot Kurt Adams, George and Elaine argue over the quality of the plane and what Elaine considers an \\"effeminate\\" way in which George sits in the jet, while Kramer is still trying to get water out of his ears from a trip to the beach he made earlier in the day.\\r\\nKramer's desperation to get the water out of his ears causes him to jump up and down on the plane and, as a result, he stumbles and falls into the cockpit, which causes the pilots to lose control. While the plane is nosediving, the four prepare for death. George, momentarily feeling the need to confess, reveals he cheated in \\"The Contest,\\" and Elaine begins to tell Jerry that she always loved him; but the plane steadies itself and they make a safe emergency landing in the fictional small town of Latham, Massachusetts.\\r\\nWhile waiting for the airplane to be repaired, they witness an overweight man named Howie (John Pinette) getting carjacked at gunpoint by a criminal (Jerry Thomas Johnson). Instead of helping him, they crack jokes about his size while Kramer films it all on his camcorder, then proceed to walk away. The victim notices this and tells the reporting officer Matt Vogel (Scott Jaeck), who arrests them on a duty to rescue violation that requires bystanders to help out in such a situation.\\r\\nBecause this is the first case implementing this law, they are advised by the deputy to call a lawyer to represent them. Jerry and his friends do not have any choice but to call on Jackie Chiles to represent them for the upcoming trial. District Attorney Hoyt (James Rebhorn) hears that Jackie Chiles will be representing Jerry and his friends and tells the prosecutor that he will find out everything about them.\\r\\nJerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are in their cell having their meal while awaiting the trial when Jerry's beeper goes off stating that their airplane is ready. Geraldo Rivera and Jane Wells cover the news about the trial of Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer. The people associated with the main characters are packing for the trial and heading to Latham, Massachusetts. Jerry's parents Morty and Helen, George's parents Frank and Estelle, Newman, Jerry's Uncle Leo, Jacopo \\"J.\\" Peterman, David Puddy, Mickey Abbot, Kenny Bania, Susan Ross' parents, Rabbi Glickman, Keith Hernandez, and George Steinbrenner are among those shown making their way to Latham, Massachusetts. In addition to these people, many others from New York like Kramer's mother Babs Kramer and Matt Wilhelm have made the trip to watch the trial in the courtroom. A lengthy trial ensues presided over by Judge Arthur Vandelay (Stanley Anderson). George considers this to be a good sign as Arthur Vandelay was one of the many fake names he used for himself and phony companies he claimed to have worked for.\\r\\nDistrict Attorney Hoyt starts his opening statement that the defendants have ignored their Good Samaritan Law and mocked the victim of a mugging. He also states that the defendants must pay for this crime. Jackie Chiles starts his opening statement that this trial is a waste of the taxpayer's money, the defendants are innocent from bystanding, and that the real criminal is still out there.\\r\\nDistrict Attorney Hoyt starts to ask a lot of witnesses in hopes to make Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer pay for breaking the duty to rescue law.\\r\\nAs the jury goes over the evidence, Geraldo Rivera and Jane Wells recap to those watching their show about what was heard during the trial. Jane Wells even stated that the testimonies went into the night until Judge Vandelay has decided that he has heard enough. It was also mentioned that the closing arguments have occurred and that the jury has been deliberating for four and a half hours. Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer hope that Jackie Chiles would get them acquitted. Estelle enters Judge Vandelay's office in order to get him to reduce the punishment for her son if he is found guilty by doing something for him. Judge Vandelay asks \\"What do you mean?\\" and Estelle responds \\"You know.\\"\\r\\nEveryone else is seen killing time awaiting for the jury to be done:\\r\\nThe jury re-enters the courtroom. When Kramer claims that a woman on the jury is smiling at them, Jerry tells him that she's smiling at them because they might go to prison. Everyone rises when Judge Vandelay enters the courtroom. When it comes to the verdict, the forewoman of the jury (Myra Turley) states that the jury finds Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer guilty of criminal indifference. Mr. and Mrs. Ross and the testifiers are pleased with the verdict, Estelle faints, and Newman has a brief choking moment from laughing while eating food. Judge Vandelay breaks up the commotion by threatening to clear the courtroom if they didn't stop.\\r\\nHe then says to the four \\"I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of you to spend a year removed from society.\\" Judge Vandalay adjourns the court and takes his leave from the courtroom as George angrily quotes to Kramer \\"You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane!\\" As everyone starts to leave, Elaine tells David not to wait for her to which he indifferently says \\"Alright.\\" Frank tries to wake up Estelle from her fainting so that they can beat the traffic as Uncle Leo comforts Babs in the background. Before leaving with Sidra, Jackie Chiles tells the four that he may have lost the case, but he did get satisfied with Sidra while commenting \\"And by the way: they're real, and they're spectacular!\\"\\r\\nIn the final scene before the credits, the four main characters sit in their holding cell awaiting their prison transport. Kramer is finally able to get the water out of his ears after days of trying. Elaine decides that she's going to use her one phone call from prison to call Jill, saying that the prison call is the \\"king of calls\\". Jerry begins a conversation about George's shirt buttons, using lines from the first episode.[3] George then wonders if they've had that conversation before, which Jerry acknowledges.\\r\\nDuring the credits at the Latham County Prison, Jerry is wearing a Latham County orange jumpsuit and performing a stand-up routine of prison-related jokes to an audience of fellow prisoners (including Kramer and George; Elaine is not seen as she is in the women's section of the prison). No one is laughing except for the studio audience and Kramer. As Jerry is then escorted off the stage by a prison guard (Jon Hayman) for talking back at a heckler, he says to his mostly hateful audience, \\"Hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria!\\" as the audience jeers, and Kramer gives him a standing ovation.\\r\\nThe top price for a 30-second commercial during the U.S. broadcast was approximately $1 million, marking the first time ever on American television history that a regular primetime television series (as well as a non-sport broadcast) had commanded at least $1-million advertising rate (previously attained only by Super Bowl general telecasts).[4]\\r\\nIn its original American broadcast, 76.3 million U.S. television viewers tuned into \\"The Finale\\", becoming the fourth most watched overall series finale in the U.S. after M*A*S*H, Cheers and The Fugitive.[5] When this episode originally aired on NBC, TV Land paid tribute by not programming any shows opposite it, instead just showing a still shot of a closed office door with a pair of handwritten notes that said \\"We're TV Fans so... we're watching the last episode of Seinfeld. Will return at 10pm et, 7pm pt.\\"[6]\\r\\nAlthough the finale of Seinfeld enjoyed a huge audience during the May 1998 telecast, it received polarized reviews and was criticized by many for portraying the main characters as people with no respect for society, and for mocking the audience who tuned in to watch them every week. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker seemed to echo this sentiment in declaring the episode \\"off-key and bloated...Ultimately, Seinfeld and David's kiss-off to their fans was a loud, hearty, 'So long, suckers!'\\"[7] Others valued it for the large number of cameo appearances from past episodes, as well as the perceived in-joke of the four characters being convicted and imprisoned on the charge that they did nothing, a play on the \\"show about nothing\\" mantra.\\r\\nThe night before \\"The Finale\\" aired, competing ABC television show Dharma & Greg aired the episode \\"Much Ado During Nothing\\". Their story centered around their title characters trying to win back a duck lawn ornament from Dharma's friend Jane by doing the most daring sexual act in public.

Their plan centers on them \\"doing the deed\\" while the final episode is airing, saying that \\"...everybody in the country is going to be watching the last episode of Seinfeld.\\"\\r\\nAlthough Larry David has stated he has no regrets about how the show ended,[8] a 2010 Time article noted that the Seinfeld reunion during the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm \\"was viewed by many as his attempt at a do-over.\\"[8] This was also referenced by Jerry in the seventh-season finale of Curb Your Enthusiasm, saying \\"We already screwed up one finale\\" with David responding \\"we didn't screw up a finale, that was a good finale!\\" Having said that, during a Seinfeld roundtable reunion discussion, Larry admitted to understanding the disappointment and said if he were to redo it he would have kept the plot of the finale less of a secret, which only heightened expectations.\\r\\nIn 2011, the finale was ranked No. 7 on the TV Guide Network special, TV's Most Unforgettable Finales.[9]\\r\\nIn the final Top Ten List of the Late Show with David Letterman, Julia Louis-Dreyfus jokingly criticized the episode by thanking Letterman for letting her take part in \\"another hugely disappointing series finale\\", much to the faux chagrin of Jerry Seinfeld who was also there.[10]\\r\\nThis version had cut several parts from the original episode (US) or rearranged some parts:\\r\\nThe scenes that were cut are now available on DVD.","input":"When did the last episode of seinfeld air?"},{"output":"AD 622","context":"The Islamic, Muslim, or Hijri calendar (Arabic: ??????? ???????? at-taqwؐm al-hijrؐ) is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 months in a year of 354 or 355 days. It is used (often alongside the Gregorian calendar) to date events in many Muslim countries. It is also used by Muslims to determine the proper days of Islamic holidays and rituals, such as the annual period of fasting and the proper time for the pilgrimage to Mecca.\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar employs the Hijri era whose epoch was retrospectively established as the Islamic New Year of AD?622. During that year, Muhammad and his followers migrated from Mecca to Yathrib (now Medina) and established the first Muslim community (ummah), an event commemorated as the Hijra. In the West, dates in this era are usually denoted AH (Latin: Anno Hegirae, \\"in the year of the Hijra\\") in parallel with the Christian (AD) and Jewish eras (AM). In Muslim countries, it is also sometimes denoted as H[1] from its Arabic form ( ???? ????????, abbreviated ??). In English, years prior to the Hijra are reckoned as BH (\\"Before the Hijra\\").[2]\\r\\nThe current Islamic year is 1439?AH. In the Gregorian calendar, 1439?AH runs from approximately 21 September 2017 to 10 September 2018.[3][needs update]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor Central Arabia, especially Mecca, there is a lack of epigraphical evidence but details are found in the writings of Muslim authors of the Abbasid era. Inscriptions of the ancient South Arabian calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the lunisolar system. Both al-Biruni and al-Mas'udi suggest that the Ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.[4]\\r\\nThe Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of Tihamah, Hejaz, and Najd distinguished between two types of months, permitted (?all) and forbidden (?arm) months. The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the pilgrimage season, Dhu al-Qadah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram. Information about the forbidden months is also found in the writings of Procopius, where he describes an armistice with the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir which happened in the summer of 541 AD. However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The Qur'an links the four forbidden months with Nasؐ, a word that literally means \\"postponement\\".[4] According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of Kinanah,[5] by a man known as the al-Qalammas of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. qalmisa).[6]\\r\\nDifferent interpretations of the concept of Nasؐ have been proposed.[7] Some scholars, both Muslim[8][9] and Western,[4][5] maintain that the pre-Islamic calendar used in Central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, Nasؐ is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like Ibn Hisham, Ibn Manzur, and the corpus of Qur'anic exegesis.[10]\\r\\nThis is corroborated by an early Sabaic inscription, where a religious ritual was \\"postponed\\" (ns'w) due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ns' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of Nasؐ.[4] Thus the Encyclopaedia of Islam concludes \\"The Arabic system of [Nasؐ] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\\"[11]\\r\\nOthers concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the Hijra it was transformed into a lunisolar calendar containing an intercalary month added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi, and later by al-Biruni,[6][12] al-Mas'udi, and some Western scholars.[13] This interpretation considers Nasؐ to be a synonym to the Arabic word for \\"intercalation\\" (kabؐsa). The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.[5][6][12] The Jewish Nasi was the official who decided when to intercalate the Jewish calendar.[14] Some sources say that the Arabs followed the Jewish practice and intercalated seven months over nineteen years, or else that they intercalated nine months over 24 years; there is, however, no consensus among scholars on this issue.[15]\\r\\nIn the tenth year of the Hijra, as documented in the Qur'an (Sura At-Tawba (9):36ÿ37), Muslims believe God revealed the \\"prohibition of the Nasؐ\\".\\r\\nThe number of the months, with God, is twelve in the Book of God, the day that He created the heavens and the earth; four of them are sacred. That is the right religion. So wrong not each other during them. And fight the unbelievers totally even as they fight you totally and know that God is with the godfearing. Know that intercalation (nasi) is an addition to disbelief. Those who disbelieve are led to error thereby, making it lawful in one year and forbidden in another in order to adjust the number of (the months) made sacred by God and make the sacred ones permissible. The evil of their course appears pleasing to them. But God gives no guidance to those who disbelieve.\\r\\nThe prohibition of Nasؐ would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nasؐ' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the farewell sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday 6 March, AD 632) on Mount Arafat during the farewell pilgrimage to Mecca.[citation needed]\\r\\nCertainly the Nasi is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error. One year they authorise the Nasi, another year they forbid it. They observe the divine precept with respect to the number of the sacred months, but in fact they profane that which God has declared to be inviolable, and sanctify that which God has declared to be profane. Assuredly time, in its revolution, has returned to such as it was at the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the eyes of God the number of the months is twelve. Among these twelve months four are sacred, namely, Rajab, which stands alone, and three others which are consecutive.\\r\\nThe three successive sacred (forbidden) months mentioned by Prophet Muhammad (months in which battles are forbidden) are Dhu al-Qadah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram, months 11, 12, and 1. The single forbidden month is Rajab, month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.[citation needed]\\r\\nFour of the twelve Hijri months are considered sacred: Rajab (7), and the three consecutive months of Dh al-Qadah (11), Dhu al-?ijjah (12) and Mu?arram (1).[19] As the lunar calendar lags behind the solar calendar by about ten days every gregorian year, months of the Islamic calendar fall in different parts of the Gregorian calendar each year. The cycle repeats every 33 lunar years.[citation needed]\\r\\nEach month of the Islamic calendar commences on the birth of the new lunar cycle. Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the crescent (hilal) marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Dawoodi Bohra Muslims and Shia Ismaili Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29.\\r\\nIn Arabic, the \\"first day\\" of the week corresponds with Sunday of the planetary week. The Islamic weekdays, like those in the Hebrew and Bah' calendars, begin at sunset. The Christian liturgical day, kept in monasteries, begins with vespers (see vesper), which is evening, in line with the other Abrahamic traditions. Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight. Muslims gather for worship at a mosque at noon on \\"gathering day\\" (Yawm al-Jumah, yawm ??? meaning \\"day\\") which corresponds with Friday.\\r\\nThus \\"gathering day\\" is often regarded as the weekly day of rest. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., Egypt, Saudi Arabia) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., Iran) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest. A few others (e.g., Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco, Nigeria) have adopted the Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, Abraha, governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian Kingdom of Aksum (Ethiopia), attempted to destroy the Kaaba with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the Year of the Elephant, during which Muhammad was born (sura al-Fil). Most equate this to the year AD 570, but a minority use AD 571.\\r\\nThe first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to Ab Ray?n al-Bؐrnؐ:[21]\\r\\nIn AD 638 (17 AH), Abu Musa Ashaari, one of the officials of the Caliph Umar in Basrah, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should include the date of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). Uthman ibn Affan then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I.[1] Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijra calendar.\\r\\nThe first day of the first month of the Islamic calendar (1 Muharram 1 AH) was set to the first new moon after the day the Prophet moved from Quba' to Medina (originally 26 Rabi' I on the pre-Islamic calendar[22]) i.e., Friday, 16 July AD 622, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the Julian calendar.[23][24] The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July. This Julian date (16 July) was determined by medieval Muslim astronomers by projecting back in time their own tabular Islamic calendar, which had alternating 30- and 29-day months in each lunar year plus eleven leap days every 30 years. For example, al-Biruni mentioned this Julian date in the year AD 1000.[25] Although not used by either medieval Muslim astronomers or modern scholars to determine the Islamic epoch, the thin crescent moon would have also first become visible (assuming clouds did not obscure it) shortly after the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July, 1.5 days after the associated dark moon (astronomical new moon) on the morning of 14 July.[26]\\r\\nThough Cook and Crone in Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World cite a coin from 17 AH, the first surviving attested use of a Hijri calendar date alongside a date in another calendar (Coptic) is on a papyrus from Egypt in 22 AH, PERF 558.\\r\\nDue to the fact that the Islamic calendar relies on certain variable methods of observation which are used to determine its month-start-dates, the start-dates of its months sometimes vary slightly from the month-start-dates of the astronomical lunar calendar, which are based directly on astronomical calculations. Still, the Islamic calendar seldom varies by more than three days from the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, and roughly approximates it. Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the solar year in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.\\r\\nIn the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long. In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly \\"conjunction\\", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years.[27] The technical details of the adjustment are described in Tabular Islamic calendar.\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.[28] Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually in no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries. Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synch with one another.\\r\\nThis traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.[29] Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its \\"age\\" since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.\\r\\nA number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, Malaysia, Indonesia, and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do. In some instances, what a country says it does is impossible.[30][31]\\r\\nDue to the somewhat variable nature of the Islamic calendar, in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar is used primarily for religious purposes, while the Solar-based Gregorian calendar is still used primarily for matters of commerce and agriculture.\\r\\nIf the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today. But, there are divergent views on whether it is licit to do so.[32]\\r\\nA majority of theologians oppose the use of calculations (beyond the constraint that each month must be not less than 29 nor more than 30 days) on the grounds that the latter would not conform with Muhammad's recommendation to observe the new moon of Ramadan and Shawal in order to determine the beginning of these months.[33][34][35]\\r\\nHowever, some jurists see no contradiction between Muhammad's teachings and the use of calculations to determine the beginnings of lunar months.[36] They consider that Muhammad's recommendation was adapted to the culture of the times, and should not be confused with the acts of worship.[37][38][39]\\r\\nThus the jurists Ahmad Muhammad Shakir and Yusuf al-Qaradawi both endorsed the use of calculations to determine the beginning of all months of the Islamic calendar, in 1939 and 2004 respectively.[40][41] So did the Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) in 2006[42][43] and the European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) in 2007.[44][45]\\r\\nThe major Muslim associations of France also announced in 2012 that they would henceforth use a calendar based on astronomical calculations, taking into account the criteria of the possibility of crescent sighting in any place on Earth.[46] But, shortly after the official adoption of this rule by the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) in 2013, the new leadership of the association decided, on the eve of Ramadan 2013, to follow the Saudi announcement rather than to apply the rule just adopted. This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.\\r\\nFatimid Dawoodi Bohra follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of Fatimid imams.\\r\\nTurkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance (currently up to 1444 AH/2022 CE) by the Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet ??leri Ba?kanl???). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: \\"The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5 above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8 from the Sun.\\" In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of Ankara at sunset.[47]\\r\\nSaudi Arabia uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99) several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.\\r\\nThe country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.[48][49]\\r\\nBefore AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in Riyadh was at least 12 hours, then the day ending at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.\\r\\nFor AH 1420ÿ22, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).\\r\\nSince the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.\\r\\nIn 2007, the Islamic Society of North America, the Fiqh Council of North America and the European Council for Fatwa and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the Umm al-Qura calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims' calendars throughout the world.[50][51]\\r\\nSince 1 October 2016, as a cost-cutting measure, Saudi Arabia no longer uses the Islamic calendar for paying the monthly salaries of government employees but the Gregorian calendar.[52][53]\\r\\nThe Solar Hijri calendar is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the Hijra or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in AD 622.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 leap years of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 years. It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.\\r\\nMicrosoft uses the \\"Kuwaiti algorithm\\", a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,[54] to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from Kuwait, however it matches a known tabular calendar.\\r\\nImportant dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:\\r\\nDays considered important predominantly for Shia Muslims:\\r\\nDays considered important for Sunni Muslims (especially in India & parts of Asia):\\r\\nConversions may be made by using the Tabular Islamic calendar, or, for greatest accuracy (one day in 15,186 years), via the Jewish calendar. Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored. The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.\\r\\nThis table may be extended since every nineteen years the Muslim month number increases by seven. When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH. From AD412 to AD632 inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so. AD622 corresponds to BH1 and AH1. For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) ÿ year AD).\\r\\nAn example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year AD?20875?\\r\\nWe first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in AD20874. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098ÿ106)=992G19 years apart. The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore 992G7=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve ÿ 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y ÿ 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in AD20874 corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH20874. The worked example in Conversion between Jewish and civil dates, shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, AD20875 (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.\\r\\nA reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH20875 is wholly contained within the year AD20875, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.\\r\\nAn Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years). More are listed here:\\r\\nBecause a hijri or Islamic lunar year is between 10 and 12 days shorter than a civil year, it begins 10ÿ12 days earlier in the civil year following the civil year in which the previous hijri year began. Once every 33 or 34 hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.\\r\\nThe Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the Egyptian calendar was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the Iranian calendar and the 1789 Ottoman calendar (a modified Julian calendar) were also used for agriculture in their countries.[citation needed] In the Levant and Iraq the Aramaic names of the Babylonian calendar are still used for all secular matters.[citation needed] In Morocco, the Berber calendar (another Julian calendar) is still used by farmers in the countryside.[citation needed] These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.[citation needed] The Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar.[55] In Indonesia, the Javanese calendar, created by Sultan Agung in 1633, combines elements of the Islamic and pre-Islamic Saka calendars.[citation needed]\\r\\nBritish author Nicholas Hagger writes that after seizing control of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi \\"declared\\" on 1 December 1978 \\"that the Muslim calendar should start with the death of the prophet Mohammed in 632 rather than the hijra (Mohammed's 'emigration' from Mecca to Medina) in 622\\". This put the country ten solar years behind the standard Muslim calendar.[56] However, according to the 2006 Encyclopedia of the Developing World, \\"More confusing still is Qaddafi's unique Libyan calendar, which counts the years from the Prophet's birth, or sometimes from his death. The months July and August, named after Julius and Augustus Caesar, are now Nasser and Hannibal respectively.\\"[57] Reflecting on a 2001 visit to the country, American reporter Neil MacFarquhar observed, \\"Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was. The year of my visit was officially 1369. But just two years earlier Libyans had been living through 1429. No one could quite name for me the day the count changed, especially since both remained in play.?... Event organizers threw up their hands and put the Western year in parentheses somewhere in their announcements.\\"[58]","input":"What year is considered the beginning of islam?"},{"output":"about 9 days after ovulation, ranging between 6 and 12 days","context":"In humans, implantation is the stage of pregnancy at which the already fertilized egg adheres to the wall of the uterus. At this stage of prenatal development, the conceptus is a blastocyst. It is by this adhesion that the fetus receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother to be able to grow.\\r\\nIn humans, implantation of a fertilized ovum is most likely to occur about 9 days after ovulation, ranging between 6 and 12 days.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reception-ready phase of the endometrium of the uterus is usually termed the \\"implantation window\\" and lasts about 4 days. The implantation window follows around 6 days after the peak in luteinizing hormone levels. With some disparity between sources, it has been stated to occur from 7 days after ovulation until 9 days after ovulation,[2] or days 6-10 postovulation.[3] On average, it occurs during the 20th to the 23rd day after the last menstrual period.[4]\\r\\nThe implantation window is characterized by changes to the endometrium cells, which aid in the absorption of the uterine fluid. These changes are collectively known as the plasma membrane transformation and bring the blastocyst nearer to the endometrium and immobilize it. During this stage the blastocyst can still be eliminated by being flushed out of the uterus. Scientists have hypothesized that the hormones cause a swelling that fills the flattened out uterine cavity just prior to this stage, which may also help press the blastocyst against the endometrium.[5] The implantation window may also be initiated by other preparations in the endometrium of the uterus, both structurally and in the composition of its secretions.\\r\\nTo enable implantation, the uterus goes through changes in order to be able to receive the conceptus.\\r\\nThe endometrium increases thickness, becomes vascularized and its glands grow to be tortuous and boosted in their secretions. These changes reach their maximum about 7 days after ovulation.\\r\\nFurthermore, the surface of the endometrium produces a kind of rounded cells, which cover the whole area toward the uterine cavity. This happens about 9 to 10 days after ovulation.[6] These cells are called decidual cells, which emphasises that the whole layer of them is shed off in every menstruation if no pregnancy occurs, just as leaves of deciduous trees. The uterine glands, on the other hand, decrease in activity and degenerate already 8 to 9 days[6] after ovulation in absence of pregnancy.\\r\\nThe decidual cells originate from the stromal cells that are always present in the endometrium. However, the decidual cells make up a new layer, the decidua. The rest of the endometrium, in addition, expresses differences between the luminal and the basal sides. The luminal cells form the zona compacta of the endometrium, in contrast to the basalolateral zona spongiosa, which consists of the rather spongy stromal cells.[6]\\r\\nDecidualization succeeds predecidualization if pregnancy occurs. This is an expansion of it, further developing the uterine glands, the zona compacta and the epithelium of decidual cells lining it. The decidual cells become filled with lipids and glycogen and take the polyhedral shape characteristic for decidual cells.\\r\\nIt is likely that the blastocyst itself makes the main contribution to this additional growing and sustaining of the decidua. An indication of this is that decidualization occurs at a higher degree in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles.[6] Furthermore, similar changes are observed when giving stimuli mimicking the natural invasion of the embryo.[6]\\r\\nThe decidua can be organized into separate sections, although they have the same composition.\\r\\nAfter implantation the decidua remains, at least through the first trimester.[6] However, its most prominent time is during the early stages of pregnancy, during implantation. Its function as a surrounding tissue is replaced by the definitive placenta. However, some elements of the decidualization remain throughout pregnancy.[6]\\r\\nThe compacta and spongiosa layers are still observable beneath the decidua in pregnancy. The glands of the spongiosa layer continue to secrete during the first trimester, when they degenerate. However, before that disappearance, some glands secrete unequally much. This phenomenon of hypersecretion is called the Arias-Stella phenomenon,[6] after the pathologist Javier Arias-Stella.\\r\\nPinopodes are small, finger-like protrusions from the endometrium. They appear between day 19 and day 21[6] of gestational age. This corresponds to a fertilization age of approximately 5 to 7 days, which corresponds well with the time of implantation. They only persist for 2 to 3 days.[6] The development of them is enhanced by progesterone but inhibited by estrogens.\\r\\nPinopodes endocytose uterine fluid and macromolecules in it. By doing so, the volume of the uterus decreases, taking the walls closer to the embryoblast floating in it. Thus, the period of active pinocytes might also limit the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nPinopodes continue to absorb fluid, and removes most of it during the early stages of implantation.\\r\\nsecreted by the endometrial glands[6]\\r\\nalpha-2-globulin (alpha-2-PEG)\\r\\n(PAPP-A)\\r\\nNot only the lining of the uterus transforms, but in addition, the secretion from its epithelial glands changes. This change is induced by increased levels of progesterone from the corpus luteum. The target of the secretions is the embryoblast, and has several functions on it.\\r\\nThe embryoblast spends approximately 72 hours[6] in the uterine cavity before implanting. In that time, it cannot receive nourishment directly from the blood of the mother, and must rely on secreted nutrients into the uterine cavity, e.g. iron[6] and fat-soluble vitamins.[6]\\r\\nIn addition to nourishment, the endometrium secretes several steroid-dependent proteins,[6] important for growth and implantation. Cholesterol[6] and steroids[6] are also secreted. Implantation is further facilitated by synthesis of matrix substances, adhesion molecules and surface receptors for the matrix substances. When the sperm nucleus and the egg nucleus have fused together, they form a zygote\\r\\nImplantation is initiated when the blastocyst comes into contact with the uterine wall.\\r\\nTo be able to perform implantation, the blastocyst first needs to get rid of its zona pellucida. This process can be called \\"hatching\\".\\r\\nLytic factors in the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the blastocyst itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions.[6] A substance probably involved is plasmin. Plasminogen, the plasmin precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active plasmin. This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects in vitro by plasmin.[6] Furthermore, plasmin inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.[6]\\r\\nThe very first, albeit loose, connection between the blastocyst and the endometrium is called the apposition.[6]\\r\\nOn the endometrium, the apposition is usually made where there is a small crypt in it, perhaps because it increases the area of contact with the rather spherical blastocyst.\\r\\nOn the blastocyst, on the other hand, it occurs at a location where there has been enough lysis of the zona pellucida to have created a rupture to enable direct contact between the underlying trophoblast and the decidua of the endometrium.[6] However, ultimately, the inner cell mass, inside the trophoblast layer, is aligned closest to the decidua. Nevertheless, the apposition on the blastocyst is not dependent on if it is on the same side of the blastocyst as the inner cell mass. Rather, the inner cell mass rotates inside the trophoblast to align to the apposition.[6] In short, the entire surface of the blastocyst has a potential to form the apposition to the decidua.\\r\\nThe identity of the molecules on the trophoblast and the endometrial epithelia that mediate the initial interaction between the two remain unidentified. However, a number of research groups have proposed that MUC1, a member of the Mucin family of glycosylated proteins, is involved.[7] MUC1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed at the apical surface of endometrial epithelial cells during the window of implantation in humans and has been shown to be differentially expressed between fertile and infertile subjects during this time.[7] MUC1 displays carbohydrate moieties on its extracellular domain that are ligands of L-selectin, a protein expressed on the surface of trophoblast cells.[8] An in vitro model of implantation developed by Genbacev et al., gave evidence to support the hypothesis that L-selectin mediates apposition of the blastocyst to the uterine epithelium by interacting with its ligands.[9]\\r\\nAdhesion is a much stronger attachment to the endometrium than the loose apposition.\\r\\nThe trophoblasts adhere by penetrating the endometrium, with protrusions of trophoblast cells.\\r\\nThere is massive communication between the blastocyst and the endometrium at this stage. The blastocyst signals to the endometrium to adapt further to its presence, e.g. by changes in the cytoskeleton of decidual cells. This, in turn, dislodges the decidual cells from their connection to the underlying basal lamina, which enables the blastocyst to perform the succeeding invasion.[6]\\r\\nThis communication is conveyed by receptor-ligand-interactions, both integrin-matrix and proteoglycan ones.\\r\\nAnother ligand-receptor system involved in adhesion is proteoglycan receptors, found on the surface of the decidua of the uterus. Their counterparts, the proteoglycans, are found around the trophoblast cells of the blastocyst. This ligand-receptor system also is present just at the implantation window.[6]\\r\\nInvasion is an even further establishment of the blastocyst in the endometrium.\\r\\nThe protrusions of trophoblast cells that adhere into the endometrium continue to proliferate and penetrate into the endometrium. As these trophoblast cells penetrate, they differentiate to become a new type of cells, syncytiotrophoblast. The prefix syn- refers to the transformation that occurs as the boundaries between these cells disappear to form a single mass of many cell nuclei (a syncytium). The rest of the trophoblasts, surrounding the inner cell mass, are hereafter called cytotrophoblasts.\\r\\nInvasion continues with the syncytiotrophoblasts reaching the basal membrane beneath the decidual cells, penetrating it and further invading into the uterine stroma. Finally, the whole embryo is embedded in the endometrium. Eventually, the syncytiotrophoblasts come into contact with maternal blood and form chorionic villi. This is the initiation of forming the placenta.\\r\\nThe blastocyst secretes factors for a multitude of purposes during invasion. It secretes several autocrine factors, targeting itself and stimulating it to further invade the endometrium.[6] Furthermore, secretions loosen decidual cells from each other, prevent the embryo from being rejected by the mother, trigger the final decidualization and prevent menstruation.\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin is an autocrine growth factor for the blastocyst.[6] Insulin-like growth factor 2,[6] on the other hand, stimulates the invasiveness of it.\\r\\nThe syncytiotrophoblasts dislodges decidual cells in their way, both by degradation of cell adhesion molecules linking the decidual cells together as well as degradation of the extracellular matrix between them.\\r\\nCell adhesion molecules are degraded by syncytiotrophoblast secretion of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This inhibits the expression of cadherins and beta-catenin.[6] Cadherins are cell adhesion molecules, and beta-catenin helps to anchor them to the cell membrane. Inhibited expression of these molecules thus loosens the connection between decidual cells, permitting the syncytotrophoblasts and the whole embryo with them to invade into the endometrium.\\r\\nThe extracellular matrix is degraded by serine endopeptidases and metalloproteinases. Examples of such metalloproteinases are collagenases, gelatinases and stromelysins.[6] These collagenases digest Type-I collagen, Type-II collagen, Type-III collagen, Type-VII collagen and Type-X collagen.[6] The gelatinases exist in two forms; one digesting Type-IV collagen and one digesting gelatin.[6]\\r\\nThe embryo differs from the cells of the mother, and would be rejected as a parasite by the immune system of the mother if it didn't secrete immunosuppressive agents. Such agents are Platelet-activating factor, human chorionic gonadotropin, early pregnancy factor, immunosuppressive factor, Prostaglandin E2, Interleukin 1-alpha, Interleukin 6, interferon-alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor and Colony-Stimulating Factor.\\r\\nFactors from the blastocyst also trigger the final formation of decidual cells into their proper form. In contrast, some decidual cells in the proximity of the blastocyst degenerate, providing nutrients for it.[6]\\r\\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) not only acts as an immunosuppressive,[6] but also \\"notifies\\" the mother's body that she is pregnant, preventing menstruation by sustaining the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nOther factors secreted by the blastocyst are;\\r\\nImplantation failure is considered to be caused by inadequate uterine receptivity in two-thirds of cases, and by problems with the embryo itself in the other third.[11]\\r\\nInadequate uterine receptivity may be caused by abnormal cytokine and hormonal signaling as well as epigenetic alterations.[12] Recurrent implantation failure is a cause of female infertility. Therefore, pregnancy rates can be improved by optimizing endometrial receptivity for implantation.[12] Evaluation of implantation markers may help to predict pregnancy outcome and detect occult implantation deficiency.[12]\\r\\nLuteal support is the administration of medication, generally progestins, for the purpose of increasing the success rate of implantation and early embryogenesis, thereby complementing the function of the corpus luteum.\\r\\nIn women with more than 3 implantation failures in assisted reproduction, a review of several small randomized controlled studies estimated that the use of adjunct low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) improves live birth rate by approximately 80%.[13]","input":"When is an egg implanted in the uterus?"},{"output":"Beth Emhoff","context":"Contagion is a 2011 U.S. medical thriller-disaster film directed by Steven Soderbergh.

The film was well received by critics, who praised the narratives and the performances of various actors and actresses. It was also well received by scientists, who praised its accuracy. Commercially, the film was a box office success. Budgeted at $60 million, Contagion attained $135 million in box office revenue during its theatrical run.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning from a Hong Kong business trip, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago to rendezvous with a former lover before returning to her family in suburban Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes symptomatic and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.\\r\\nMitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is placed in isolation but seems to be immune to the disease. He is released and returns home to his teenage daughter Jory, though they are unsure if she has inherited his immunity. She decides to stay with her father regardless, since he's now all alone. Mitch struggles to protect his daughter from the risk of infection, while learning that his wife was unfaithful to him prior to her death. Meanwhile, everyone who had contact with Emhoff begins to spread the disease around the world.\\r\\nIn Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the CDC and express fears that the disease is a bio weapon terror attack over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the U.S. outbreak to Emhoff, while also dealing with local bureaucrats who are initially reluctant to commit to a proper public health response. After successfully setting up triage camps in large venues, Dr. Mears becomes infected. Her evacuation is postponed, as airports begin to close in anticipation of a quarantine. She later dies and is buried in a mass grave. As more and more people become infected with no cure in sight, social order begins to decay, with rampant looting of stores and homes. The U.S. President is moved underground while emergency services suffer absenteeism and no longer respond. Mitch and Jory attempt to escape to Wisconsin, but the borders are closed.\\r\\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig and bat viruses. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a cell culture within which to grow the newly named Meningoencephalitis Virus One (MEV-1).\\r\\nUCSF professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from the CDC to destroy his samples, and on Day 12, with over 8 million already infected worldwide, identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to start working on a vaccine. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by fomites with a basic reproduction number of four when the virus mutates, projecting that one in twelve of the world population will be infected, with a 25-30% mortality rate.\\r\\nConspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his popular blog. In one video, he shows himself sick and later claims he recovered using a homeopathic cure derived from forsythia. In a panic, people seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies.\\r\\nKrumwiede's claims attract national attention. During a television interview, he reveals that Dr. Cheever had secretly advised his fianc to leave Chicago just before the city was quarantined. Cheever is informed the government will investigate and may charge him for leaking information. Later, it is revealed Krumwiede had faked being infected in an attempt to increase profits for a hedge fund that paid him for advice on a cure, which he randomly stated was forsythia. Krumwiede is arrested for conspiracy, securities fraud and manslaughter, but is released when his many supporters successfully raise funds to provide for his bail.\\r\\nUsing an attenuated virus, Dr. Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy testing process, she inoculates herself with the experimental vaccine and visits her father, a doctor suffering with MEV-1 after he refused to stop treating patients during the outbreak. Hextall does not contract MEV-1 and the vaccine is declared a success.\\r\\nEven at full production rates, the vaccine supply can not match demand, so the CDC awards the vaccinations by lottery based on birth date; inoculations will take one full year to complete. First responders, doctors, and others designated by the government are vaccinated ahead of the lottery. Dr. Cheever gives his fast-tracked vaccination to the son of Roger, a CDC janitor who had overheard Dr. Cheever's phone call warning his girlfriend to leave Chicago. Meanwhile, Mitch and Jory reconcile with the hope of life going back to normal.\\r\\nIn the opening days, Dr. Leonora Orantes, a WHO epidemiologist, traveled to Hong Kong to follow the Beth Emhoff lead. She collaborates with Sun Feng and other local epidemiologists and public health officials; they identify Emhoff as patient zero, with security video showing her as the common contact with the next three known victims at a Macau casino. Before she can leave, Feng kidnaps Orantes to use her as leverage to obtain (anticipated) MEV-1 vaccine doses for his village. Orantes spends months living with the villagers until the vaccine is announced. Feng exchanges Orantes for enough vaccine for his village. When her colleague reveals that similar kidnappings were widespread, and the doses were placebos, Orantes rushes back to warn the villagers, exhibiting Stockholm Syndrome.\\r\\nBy Day 26, the death toll had reached at least 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide. The discovery, production and initial deliveries of vaccine took until Day 133, with vaccinations to run until nearly Day 500. The final death toll is not mentioned.\\r\\nDr. Hextall places samples of MEV-1 in cryogenic storage, alongside samples of H1N1 and SARS.\\r\\nThe source of the virus is revealed to viewers. A bulldozer (coincidentally, operating for the company Emhoff worked for) clears some jungle and disturbs some bats, with one finding shelter and food in a banana tree. That bat then flies over a pig pen, dropping a chunk of banana from its mouth, which is then eaten by a piglet. A chef from the Macau casino chooses the piglet and returns to the casino. As he handles the carcass in the kitchen, getting abrasions on his hands, he only wipes his hands when called to meet a customer ÿ Beth Emhoff. The chef shakes hands with Beth (Mitch views the handshake on her camera in a previous scene), giving her the mix of bat and pig viruses, making the chef patient zero and Beth the second case.\\r\\nScott Z. Burns.[5]\\r\\nConcerted efforts to devise Contagion coincided with Burns' collaboration with Soderbergh in The Informant! (2009).[5] The duo had initially planned to create a biographical film on Leni Riefenstahl, a trailblazer in German cinema during the 1930s and a figure in the rise of the Nazi Party. Soderbergh later contacted Burns to cancel the project, as he thought that a film about Riefenstahl would struggle to attract an audience.[5] Intrigued with the field of transmission, Burns suggested that they instead create a film that centered on a pandemic situation\\"an interesting thriller version of a pandemic movie\\". His main objective was to construct a medical thriller that \\"really felt like what could happen\\".[5]\\r\\nBurns consulted with Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Brilliant, renowned for his work in eradicating smallpox, to develop an accurate perception of a pandemic event.[5] He had seen one of Brilliant's TED presentations, which he was fascinated by, and realized that \\"the point of view of people within that field isn't 'If this is going to happen', it's 'When is this going to happen?'\\"[5] Brilliant introduced Burns to another specialist, W. Ian Lipkin. With the aid of these physicians, the producers were able to obtain additional perspectives from representatives of the World Health Organization.[5] Burns also met with the author of The Coming Plague, Laurie Garrett. Her 1995 book helped Burns consider a variety of potential plots for the film. He wanted to feature an official from the CDC, and ultimately decided to use an epidemiologist, since that role requires interacting with people while tracking the disease.[5]\\r\\nAlthough he had done research on pandemics six months prior to the 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was \\"really helpful\\" to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic. To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation.[5] \\"I saw them come to life\\", Burns said, \\"and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their kids at home?' Things happening online, which is where the Jude Law character came from, that there's going to be information that comes out online where people want to be ahead of the curve, so some people will write things about anti-virals or different treatment protocols, and so there's always going to be an information and that information also has sort of a viral pulse.\\"[5]\\r\\nIn conjunction with overseeing the directing process, Soderbergh functioned as a cinematographer for Contagion.[3] The film was wholly shot using Red Digital Cinema Camera Company's RED One MX digital camera, which uses ambient light and has a 4.5K image resolution.[3][9] Since he hoped for the premise to be authentic and \\"as realistic as possible\\", Soderbergh opted not to film in the studio. \\"There's, to me, nothing more satisfying occasionally than making someplace look like someplace else on film and having nobody know the difference.\\"[10] For choosing cities, Soderbergh felt that they couldn't \\"go anywhere where one of our characters hasn't been\\", since he wanted to portray an \\"epic\\", yet \\"intimate\\" scenario.[6] He explained,\\r\\nWe can't cut to a city or a group of extras that we've never been to that we dont know personally. That was our rule. And thats a pretty significant rule to adhere to in a movie in which you're trying to give a sense of something thats happening on a large scale, but we felt that all of the elements that we had issues with prior, when we see any kind of disaster film, we're centered around that idea.[6]\\r\\nPrincipal photography started in Hong Kong in September 2010,[3] and continued for approximately two weeks.[5] Soderbergh was originally hoping to also film in mainland China, though Moviefone journalist David Ehrlich believed that permission from the Chinese government was unlikely to be forthcoming.[11] Although producers also intended to establish a filming location in one of the many casinos in Macau, the Jumbo Floating Restaurant in Hong Kong's Aberdeen Harbour was used instead for the casino setting, as filming within the vicinity of a gambling establishment is prohibited by law.[3] To move the equipment for the casino scenes to the on-the-water location, producers hired a number of locals to carry out the task, as they were accustomed to \\"using sampans like trucks\\".[3] Additional locations included the Hong Kong International Airport, InterContinental Hong Kong, and the Princess Margaret Hospital.[3]\\r\\nPrincipal photography relocated in the following month to Chicago, Illinois, which served as the nexus for production.[3] Much of the cityscape and its surrounding suburbs were used to emulate Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Atlanta, Georgia, in addition to serving as backdrop for Chicago itself.[3] Since principal photography occurred during the winter months, snowfall was a prerequisite in simulating a \\"persistent coldness\\" that encompassed \\"a hypersensitive kind of glare\\".[3] Within the city limits, filming locations were installed at the Shedd Aquarium,[12] O'Hare International Airport, and the Midway Airport.[3] Arguably the largest sets were at the General Jones Armory, which was converted into an infirmary, and a major location shoot occurred in Waukegan, where a portion of the Amstutz Expressway was used to simulate the Dan Ryan Expressway.[3][13] Production also took place at Sherman Hospital in Elgin and Central Elementary School in Wilmette, and also in Downtown Western Springs, where the grocery store scene was filmed.[3]\\r\\nFilming moved once again in January 2011 to the Druid Hills quadrant of Atlanta, which contains the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within the parking garage and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite.[14] Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur,[14] before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month.[15] The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits.[15] In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization.[3] For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work.[16] Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.[3][15]\\r\\nCliff Martinez composed the film's soundtrack, which was his first score for Soderbergh since Solaris in 2002.[17] Given that the pacing of the music was one of Soderbergh's biggest concerns, Martinez needed to maintain a brisk pace throughout the soundtrack, while also conveying fear and hope within the music.[17] \\"I tried to create the sound of anxiety. And at key, strategic moments I tried to use the music to conjure up the sense of tragedy and loss.\\"[17] Martinez incorporated orchestral elements, and fused them with the predominantly electronic sounds of the score. He noted that the \\"sound palette for Contagion came by way of combining three very different approaches Steven went through as he was cutting the film.\\"[17] Martinez received a rough cut for the film in October 2010, which contained music that was imbued with elements of The French Connection (1971) and Marathon Man (1976). He \\"loved\\" those two soundtracks, and composed a few pieces in their style.[17] A few months later, he acquired a new cut, which included music influenced by German electronic group Tangerine Dream.[17] Toward the end, Soderbergh changed again and used contemporary soundtrack music that was \\"more energetic and more rhythmic\\".[18] Ultimately, Martinez used aspects of all three approaches: \\"I reasoned that combining them would not only be effective but would give the score a style all its own.\\"[17]\\r\\nSteven Soderbergh was motivated to make an \\"ultra-realistic\\" film about the public health and scientific response to a pandemic.[19] The movie touches on a variety of themes, including the factors which drive mass panic and collapse of social order, the scientific process for characterizing and containing a novel pathogen, balancing personal motives against professional responsibilities and rules in the face of an existential threat, the limitations and consequences of public health responses, and the pervasiveness of interpersonal connections which can serve as vectors to spread disease.[20] Soderbergh acknowledged the salience of these post-apocalyptic themes is heightened by reactions to the September?11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.[20] The movie was intended to realistically convey the \\"intense\\" and \\"unnerving\\" social and scientific reactions to a pandemic.[21] The recent real-life epidemics such as the 2003 SARS epidemic and the 2009 flu pandemic have been inspirations and influences in the film.[21] The chain of contagion involving bats and pigs is reminiscent of the trail of the Nipah virus (which infects cells in the respiratory and nervous systems, the same cells as the virus in the movie) that originated in Malaysia in 1997, which similarly involved the disturbance of a bat colony by deforestation.[22]\\r\\nThe film presents examples of crowd psychology and collective behavior which can lead to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves.[20][23][24] Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus.[25] The movie indirectly critiques the greed, selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have in the context of a pandemic.[26] For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking.[26] Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.[27]\\r\\nAgainst this existential threat and fraying social order, the film also explores how individual characters bend or break existing rules for both selfish and selfless reasons.[28] Dr. Hextall violates protocols by testing a potential vaccine on herself, Dr. Sussman continues experiments on a cell line despite orders to destroy his samples, Dr. Cheever notifies his fianc to leave the city before a public quarantine is imposed, Sun Feng kidnaps Dr. Orantes to secure vaccine supplies for his village, Dr. Mears continues her containment work despite contracting the virus, and Krumwiede is paid to use his blog to peddle snake oil cures so as to drive demand and profit for investors in Alternative Medicine. Soderbergh repeatedly uses the cinematographic style of lingering and focusing on the items and objects which are touched by the infected and become vectors (fomites) to infect other people.[29] These objects link characters together and reinforce the multi-narrative hyperlink cinema style which Soderbergh developed in Traffic (2000) and Syriana (2005), which he produced.[27][30]\\r\\nThe story also highlights examples of political cronyism (a plane to evacuate Dr. Mears from Minneapolis is instead diverted to evacuate a Congressman), platitudes and rigid thinking (public health officials consider postponing the closing of shopping malls until after the Thanksgiving shopping season), federal responders trying to navigate 50 separate state-level public health policies, and the heroism of Federal bureaucrats.[20][24] Soderbergh does not use type-cast pharmaceutical executives or politicians as villains,[31] but instead portrays bloggers such as Krumwiede in a negative light.[24] Social media plays a role in Krumwiede's accusations against Dr. Cheever and in Emhoff's daughter's attempts to carry on a relationship with her boyfriend through text messaging.[27] Other responses in the movie, such as Emhoff's appropriating a shotgun from a friend's abandoned house to protect his home from looters, imposition of federal quarantines and curfews, the allocation of vaccines by lottery, inadequate federal preparation and responses, and use of bar-coded wristbands to identify the inoculated highlight the complex tensions between freedom and order in responding to a pandemic.[25] Soderbergh uses Emhoff to illustrate the micro-effects of macro-level decisions.[32]\\r\\nContagion premiered on September 3, 2011 at the 68th Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy,[33] and a wider release followed on September 9.[34] In the United States and Canada, Contagion was shown in 3,222 theaters, of which 254 screenings occurred at IMAX venues.[35] Various American commercial analysts anticipated that the film would have ticket sales of between $20?million and $25?million during its opening weekend,[34][35] which it did, grossing $8?million on its first day,[36] and $23.1M for the entire weekend.[37] Of that total, ten percent ($2.3M) of the gross came from IMAX screenings.[38] By outgrossing competitor The Help ($8.7M), Contagion became the highest-grossing film of the week.[37] Demographically, the opening audience was evenly divided among gender, according to Warner Bros., while eighty percent of spectators were of the age of 25 and over.[37][39] Contagion did well the following weekend, generating a $14.5M box office, but came in second to the re-release of The Lion King (1994).[40] The third week saw the box office drop by forty percent, for a total gross of $8.7M.[41] By the fourth week, Contagion had dropped to ninth place at the box office with $5M, and the number of theaters narrowed to 2,744.[42] The film completed its theatrical run on December 15, 2011, at which point its total domestic gross was $75.6M.[1]\\r\\nContagion made its international debut in six foreign markets the same weekend as its American release, including Italy, where it achieved $663,000 from 309 theaters.[43] The first week saw Contagion acquire $2.1M from 553 establishmentsa per-theater average of $3,797.[43] Foreign grosses for Contagion would remain relatively stagnant up until the weekend of October 14ÿ16, 2011, when the film expanded into several additional European markets.[44] Out of the $3.9M that was generated from 1,100 venues during that weekend, nearly 40% of the gross originated from Spain, where the film earned $1.5M from 325 theaters.[44] With the growing expansion of the film in seven additional markets, the weekend of October 21ÿ23, 2011 saw Contagion take in $9.8M from 2,505 locations, increasing the international gross to $22.9M.[45] In the United Kingdom, one of the film's significant international releases, Contagion opened in third place at the box office with $2.3M from 398 theaters;[45] it subsequently garnered the highest debut gross of a Soderbergh film since Ocean's Thirteen (2007).[46] International grosses for Contagion stand at $59.8M.[1]\\r\\nContagion has received positive reviews by film commentators. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes sampled 237 reviewers and judged 84% of the reviews to be positive. With a mean score of 7/10, the site's consensus stated, \\"Tense, tightly plotted, and bolstered by a stellar cast, Contagion is an exceptionally smartand scarydisaster movie.\\"[47] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on the critiques from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 70 based on 38 reviews.[48]\\r\\nThe Guardian journalist Peter Bradshaw felt that Contagion blended well together as a film, although opined that Soderbergh was somewhat unsuccessful on channeling the fears, frights, and \\"the massive sense of loss\\" of \\"ordinary people\\".[49] To David Denby of The New Yorker, the \\"brilliant\\" film was \\"serious, precise, frightening,\\" and \\"emotionally enveloping\\".[20] Despite applauding Soderbergh for \\"hopscotching\\" tidily \\"between the intimate and international\\", The Atlantic's Christopher Orr was disappointed with the film's detached and \\"clinical\\" disposition, which led him to conclude that Contagion should have gone with a more inflexible rationale, or a lesson \\"beyond 'wash your hands often and hope you're lucky'.\\"[50] \\"For all the craft that went into it, Contagion is ultimately beyond good or bad, beyond criticism. It just is,\\" professed The Atlantic writer.[50] Described as a \\"smart\\" and \\"spooky\\" installment, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, \\"Mr. Soderbergh doesn't milk your tears as things fall apart, but a passion that can feel like cold rage is inscribed in his images of men and women isolated in the frame, in the blurred point of view of the dying and in the insistent stillness of a visual style that seems like an exhortation to look.\\"[29] In regards to the story, Salon columnist Andrew O'Hehir avouched that the \\"crisp\\" and succinct narrative matched up to the \\"beautifully composed\\" visuals of the film.[24] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter proclaimed that Soderbergh and Burns effectively created anxiety in the \\"shrewd\\" and \\"unsensationalistic\\" film without becoming exaggerated,[51] a sentiment echoed by Jeanette Catsolis of NPR, who insisted that the duo \\"weave multiple characters into a narrative that's complex without being confusing, and intelligent without being baffling\\".[32] Writing for The Village Voice, Karina Longworth thought that Contagion reflected the \\"self-consciousness\\" and \\"experimentation\\" of some of Soderbergh's previous efforts, such as the Ocean's trilogy and The Girlfriend Experience (2009).[26]\\r\\nThe performances of multiple cast members were frequently mentioned in the reviews. Lou Lumenick of New York Post asserted that Ehle was \\"outstanding\\",[23] a view that was analogous to that of The Boston Globe journalist Wesley Morris, who praised not only Ehle's performance, but the work of the \\"undercard\\" such as Cranston, Gould, and Colantoni, among others.[30] Similarly, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Ehle the \\"best in show\\".[52] As Los Angeles Times' Kenneth Turan summed up, \\"Two-time Tony-winning actress Jennifer Ehle comes close to stealing the picture with this quietly yet quirkily empathetic performance.\\"[53] In regards to Law, The Philadelphia Inquirer's Steven Rea stated that the actor portrayed the character with a \\"nutty\\" confidence;[54] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle agreed with Rea's thoughts.[55][56] Damon provided the film's \\"relatable heart\\", according to Forrest Wickman of Slate, who concluded that even with her controlled performance, Winslet \\"lives up to her head-of-the-class reputation even in an unusually small role\\".[27]\\r\\nThe character development of multiple characters produced varying response from critics. Contrary to Mitch's stance as the main protagonist, Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post felt that Contagion \\"treats him with an oddly clinical detachment\\".[57] In particular Law's character, Alan Krumwiede, attracted commentary from Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who wrote, \\"The blogger subplot doesn't interact clearly with the main story lines and functions mostly as an alarming but vague distraction.\\"[58]\\r\\nFerris Jabr of New Scientist approved of Contagion for accurately portraying the \\"successes and frustrations\\" of science. Jabr cites story elements such as \\"the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they need to figure out how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells\\" as examples of accurate depictions of science.[59] Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, \\"It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die.\\" He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that \\"Lipkin and his colleagues are now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk.\\"[60] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that \\"typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here.\\" Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.[61]\\r\\nContagion was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on January 3, 2012,[62] and in the United Kingdom on March 5, 2012.[63] In its first week of release, the film topped the DVD chart with 411,000 units sold for $6.16?million.[64] That same week it sold 274,000 Blu-ray copies for $4.93?million, topping that chart as well.[65] DVD sales dropped during the second week of release, with 193,000 units sold for $2.89?million.[66] As of early July 2012, Contagion had sold 802,535 copies in DVD, for $12.01?million in revenue.[62]","input":"Who was the first person infected in contagion?"},{"output":"By the year 1870","context":"","input":"When was the american public school system established?"},{"output":"Kesh (uncut hair)","context":"In Sikhism, the Five Ks (Punjabi: ??? ???? Pa?j Kakr) are five items that Guru Gobind Singh commanded Khalsa Sikhs to wear at all times in 1699. They are: Kesh (uncut hair), Kangha (a wooden comb for the hair), Kara (an iron bracelet), Kachera (100% cotton tieable undergarment (not an elastic one)) and Kirpan (an iron dagger large enough to defend yourself).\\r\\nThe Five Ks are not just symbols, but articles of faith that collectively form the external identity and the Khalsa devotee's commitment to the Sikh rehni \\"Sikh way of life\\".[1] A Sikh who has taken Amrit and keeps all five Ks is known as Khalsa (\\"pure\\") or Amritdhari Sikh (\\"Amrit Sanskar participant\\"), while a Sikh who has not taken Amrit but follows the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is called a Sahajdhari Sikh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Kesh, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs as an indispensable part of the human body. Long known as a sign of spiritual devotion, it also emulates the appearance of Guru Gobind Singh and is one of the primary signs by which a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God's creation. The uncut long hair and the beard, in the case of men, form the main kakr for Sikhs.[2]\\r\\nThe turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to the Sikh that they are sitting on the throne of consciousness and is committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his Sikhs:\\r\\n\\"Khaalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khaalsa mai ho karo nivaas... The Khalsa is my image. Within the Khalsa I reside.\\"[3] Wearing a turban declares sovereignty, dedication, self-respect, courage and piety.\\r\\nA noted figure in Sikh history is Bhai Taru Singh, who was martyred when he refused to get his Kesh cut.\\r\\nComb the hair twice a day, covering it with turban that is to be tied from fresh.\\r\\nA Kangha is a small wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair, and is a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized.\\r\\nThe comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru Gobind Singh said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this excludes any shaving for both men and women. In the Guru's time, some holy men let their hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru said that this was not right; that hair should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice a day.\\r\\nThe Sikhs were commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear an iron bracelet called a Kara at all times. The Kara is a constant reminder to always remember that whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice given by the Guru. The Kara is an iron/steel circle to symbolise God as never ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is \\"kari\\").\\r\\n??? ?? ?? ?? ????? ????? ?????? ? The sign of true chastity is the Kachera, you must wear this and hold weapons in hand.\\r\\nOriginally, the Kachmemeosera was made part of the five Ks as a symbol of a Sikh soldier's willingness to be ready at a moment's notice for battle or for defence. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the Amrit) wears a Kachera every day. Some go to the extent of wearing a Kacheraye while bathing, to be ready to at a moment's notice, changing into the new one a single leg at a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash and carry compared to other traditional under-garments of that era, like the dhoti. The Kachera symbolises self-respect, and always reminds the wearer of mental control over lust, one of the Five Evils in Sikh philosophy.\\r\\nKachenarsra follow a generally practical and roomy design. It features an embedded string that circles the waist which can be tightened/loosened as desired, and then knotted securely. The Kachera can be classed between underwear and an outer garment, as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts. As with all of the Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it. Considering the hot climate in India, the Kachera is often worn by men as an outer garment, keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, however it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the Kachera as an outer garment (on its own) as it is considered too revealing.\\r\\n????? ??? ???? ??? ???, ??????? ????? ??? ?Those who never depart his/her arms, they are the Khalsa with excellent rehats.\\r\\nThe Kirpan is a dagger which symbolizes a Sikh's duty to come to the defence of those in peril.

The ordained priesthood and the common priesthood (or priesthood of all the baptized faithful) are different in function and essence.[1][2] The Catholic Church teaches that when a man participates in priesthood, he participates in the priesthood of Christ Himself. All men who, through the Sacrament of Holy Orders, have become priests participate in Christ's priesthood; they act in persona Christi Capitis, in the person of Christ, the Head of His Body, the Church.[3]\\r\\nUnlike usage in English, \\"the Latin words sacerdos and sacerdotium are used to refer in general to the ministerial priesthood shared by bishops and presbyters. The words presbyter, presbyterium and presbyteratus refer to priests in the English use of the word or presbyters.\\"[4] According to the Annuario Pontificio 2016, as of December 31, 2014, there were 415,792 Catholic priests worldwide, including both diocesan priests and priests in the religious orders.[5] A priest of the regular clergy is commonly addressed with the title \\"Father\\" (abbreviated Fr., in the Roman Catholic and some other Christian churches).[6]\\r\\nThe state of consecrated life or monasticism is a separate, third distinct vocational state from the clergy and the laity. As an overview, there are the members of the laitywho are married or unmarried, and the clergythe bishops, priests, and deacons. Deacons are male and usually belong to the diocesan clergy, but, unlike almost all Latin-rite (Western Catholic) priests and all bishops from Eastern or Western Catholicism, they may marry as laymen before their ordination as clergy.[7]\\r\\nMembers of institutes of consecrated life, or monks, can be either clergy or non-ordained members of the religious order (male or female non-ordained religious are not to be considered laypersons in the strict sensethey take certain vows and are not free to marry once they have made solemn profession of vows; all female religious are non-ordained, they may be sisters living to some degree of activity in a communal state, or nuns living in cloister or some other type of isolation). The male members of religious orders, whether living in monastic communities or cloistered in isolation, and who are ordained priests or deacons constitute what is called the religious or regular clergy, distinct from the diocesan or secular clergy. Those ordained priests or deacons who are not members of some sort of religious order (secular priests) most often serve as clergy to a specific church or in an office of a specific diocese or in Rome.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Old Testament describes how God made his people \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation,\\"[9] and within the twelve tribes of Israel, the tribe of Levi was chosen to be set apart for the liturgical service of offering sacrifice as priests.[10] The priest was understood as a mediator between God and human beings who offers sacrifices and intercedes for the people.\\r\\nThe New Testament depicts Jesus as the \\"great high priest\\" of the New Covenant who, instead of offering the ritual animal sacrifices prescribed by the Jewish Law, offers himself on the cross as the true and perfect sacrifice.[11] The Catholic priesthood is a participation in this priesthood of Christ, and therefore traces its origins to Jesus Christ himself. Thus, the New Testament says that as high priest, Jesus has made the Church \\"a kingdom of priests for his God and Father.\\"[12] All who are baptized are given a share in the priesthood of Christ; that is, they are conformed to Christ and made capable of offering true worship and praise to God as Christians. \\"The whole community of believers is, as such, priestly.\\"[13]\\r\\nThe ministerial priesthood of Catholic priests and bishopswhat most people think of as \\"the Catholic priesthood\\"has a distinct history. This ministerial priesthood is at the service of the priesthood of all believers and involves the direct consecration of a man to Christ through the sacrament of orders, so that he can act in the person of Christ for the sake of the Christian faithful, above all in dispensing the sacraments. It is understood to have begun at the Last Supper, when Jesus Christ instituted the Eucharist in the presence of the Twelve Apostles, commanding them to \\"do this in memory of me.\\"\\r\\nThe Catholic priesthood, therefore, is a share in the priesthood of Christ and traces its historical origins to the Twelve Apostles appointed by Christ. Those apostles in turn selected other men to succeed them as the bishops (episkopoi, Greek for \\"overseers\\") of the Christian communities, with whom were associated presbyters (presbyteroi, Greek for \\"elders\\") and deacons (diakonoi, Greek for \\"servants\\"). As communities multiplied and grew in size, the bishops appointed more and more presbyters to preside at the Eucharist in place of the bishop in the multiple communities in each region. The diaconate evolved as the liturgical assistants of the bishop and his delegate for the administration of Church funds and programmes for the poor. Today, the rank of \\"presbyter\\" is typically what one thinks of as a priest, although technically both a bishop and a presbyter are \\"priests\\" in the sense that they share in Christ's ministerial priesthood and offer sacrifice to God in the person of Christ.[14]\\r\\nIn the decade of the 2010s, catholic priests as a group garnered public attention due to the numerous cases of sexual abuse of children by catholic clergy being revealed.\\r\\nThe theology of the Catholic priesthood is rooted in the priesthood of Christ and to some degree shares elements of the ancient Hebraic priesthood as well.[15] A priest is one who presides over a sacrifice and offers that sacrifice and prayers to God on behalf of believers. Jewish priesthood which functioned at the temple in Jerusalem offered animal sacrifices at various times throughout the year for a variety of reasons.\\r\\nIn Christian theology, Jesus is the Lamb provided by God himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Before his death on the cross, Jesus celebrated the Passover with his disciples (the Last Supper) and offered blessings over the bread and wine respectively, saying: \\"Take and eat. This is my body\\" and \\"Drink from this all of you, for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, poured out for the forgiveness of sins.\\" (Matthew 26:26ÿ28 Jerusalem Bible). The next day Christ's body and blood were visibly sacrificed on the cross.\\r\\nCatholics believe that it is this same body, sacrificed on the cross and risen on the third day and united with Christ's divinity, soul and blood which is made present in the offering of each Eucharistic sacrifice which is called the Eucharist. However, Catholicism does not believe that transubstantiation and the doctrine of the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist involves a material change in the 'accidental' features: i.e. under normal circumstances, scientific analysis of the Eucharistic elements would indicate the physical-material properties of wine and bread.\\r\\nThus Catholic priests, in presiding at the Eucharist, join each offering of the Eucharistic elements in union with the sacrifice of Christ.[16] Through their celebration of the Holy Eucharist, they make present the one eternal sacrifice of Christ on the cross.\\r\\nCatholicism does not teach that Christ is sacrificed again and again, but that \\"The sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Eucharist are one single sacrifice.\\".[17] Instead, the Catholic Church holds the Jewish concept of memorial in which \\"..the memorial is not merely a recollection of past events....these events become in a certain way present and real.\\" and thus \\"...the sacrifice Christ offered once and for all on the cross remains ever present.\\"[18] Properly speaking, in Catholic theology, expressed by Saint Thomas Aquinas, \\"Only Christ is the true priest, the others being only his ministers.\\"[19] Thus, Catholic clergy share in the one, unique, Priesthood of Christ.[20]\\r\\nThe Canon law of the Catholic Church holds that the priesthood is a sacred and perpetual vocational state, not just a profession (which is a reason for, and symbolized by, the state of celibacy). There are programs of formation and studies which aim to enable the future priest to effectively serve his ministry. These programs are demanded by canon law (in the Latin rite, canons 232ÿ264) which also refers to the Bishops' Conferences for local more detailed regulation. As a general rule, education is extensive and lasts at least five or six years, depending on the national Programme of Priestly Formation.[21]\\r\\nRegardless of where a person prepares for ordination, it includes not only academic but also human, social, spiritual and pastoral formation. The purpose of seminary education is ultimately to prepare men to be pastors of souls.[23] In the end, however, each individual Ordinary (such as a bishop or Superior General) is responsible for the official call to priesthood, and only a bishop may ordain. Any ordinations done before the normally scheduled time (before study completion) must have the explicit approval of the bishop; any such ordinations done more than a year in Holy See.\\r\\nThe Rite of Ordination is what \\"makes\\" one a priest, having already been a deacon and with the minister of Holy Orders being a validly ordained bishop.[24]\\r\\nThe Rite of Ordination occurs within the context of Holy Mass. After being called forward and presented to the assembly, the candidates are interrogated. Each promises to diligently perform the duties of the Priesthood and to respect and obey his ordinary (bishop or religious superior). Then the candidates lie prostrate before the altar, while the assembled faithful kneel and pray for the help of all the saints in the singing of the Litany of the Saints.\\r\\nThe essential part of the rite is when the bishop silently lays his hands upon each candidate (followed by all priests present), before offering the consecratory prayer, addressed to God the Father, invoking the power of the Holy Spirit upon those being ordained.\\r\\nAfter the consecratory prayer, the newly ordained is vested with the stole and chasuble of those belonging to the Ministerial Priesthood and then the bishop anoints his hands with chrism before presenting him with the chalice and paten which he will use when presiding at the Eucharist. Following this, the gifts of bread and wine are brought forward by the people and given to the new priest; then all the priests present, concelebrate the Eucharist with the newly ordained taking the place of honour at the right of the bishop. If there are several newly ordained, it is they who gather closest to the bishop during the Eucharistic Prayer.\\r\\nThe laying of hands of the priesthood is found in 1 Timothy 4:14:\\r\\nDo not neglect the gift you have, which was conferred on you through the prophetic word with the imposition of hands of the presbyterate.\\"\\r\\nThe following is the full text of the Rite during the Mass (after the Prelude, the Introit, the Procession, the Opening Hymn, the Kyrie, the Gloria, the Opening Prayer, and the First and Second Readings and the Gospel have all taken place), taken from a program for an ordination of priests for the Diocese of Peoria in 2015:\\r\\nThe Calling of the Candidates: Those to be ordained are called by name, they stand in their place and answer: \\"Present\\".\\r\\nThe Presentation of the Priest Candidates:\\r\\nVocation Director: Most Reverend Father, Holy Mother Church asks you to ordain these, our brothers, to the responsibility of the Priesthood.\\r\\nBishop: Do you know them to be worthy?\\r\\nVocation Director: After inquiry among the Christian people and upon the recommendation of those responsible, I testify that they have been found worthy.\\r\\nBishop: Relying on the help of the Lord God and our Savior Jesus Christ, we choose these men, our brothers, for the Order of the Priesthood.\\r\\nAll: Thanks be to God.

Do you resolve, with the help of the Holy Spirit, to discharge without fail the office of Priesthood in the presbyteral rank, as worthy fellow workers with the Order of Bishops in caring for the Lord's flock?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to exercise the ministry of the word worthily and wisely, preaching the Gospel and teaching the Catholic faith?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently, in accord with the Church's tradition, the mysteries of Christ, especially the Sacrifice of the Eucharist and the Sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God and the sanctification of the Christian people?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to implore with us God's mercy upon the people entrusted to your care by observing the command to pray without ceasing?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: Do you resolve to be united more closely every day to Christ the High Priest, who offered himself for us to the Father as a pure Sacrifice, and with him to consecrate yourselves to God for the salvation of all?\\r\\nElect: I do, with the help of God.\\r\\nPromise of Obedience of the Priest Candidates:\\r\\nEach of the candidates goes to the Bishop and, kneeling before him, places his joined hands between those of the Bishop.\\r\\nBishop: Do you promise respect and obedience to me and my successors?\\r\\nElect: I do.\\r\\nBishop: May God, who has begun this good work in you bring it to fulfillment.\\r\\nInvitation to Prayer\\r\\nLitany of the Saints\\r\\nLaying on of Hands: The Bishop first lays hands on the head of each candidate, followed by the concelebrating priests and all the priests present.\\r\\nPrayer of Consecration\\r\\nInvestiture with the Stole and Chasuble\\r\\nAnointing of Hands: The Bishop receives the linen gremial and anoints with Sacred Chrism the palms of each new priest as he kneels before him.\\r\\nProcession of the Gifts of Bread and Wine by the relatives of the ordained and Offertory Hymn\\r\\nPresentation of the Gifts\\r\\nThe Bishop stands and gives the kiss of peace to the new priests, followed by the concelebrants and all the priests present. The Liturgy of the Eucharist (the Preparation of the Altar, the Sanctus, the Memorial Acclamation, the Great Amen, the Lamb of God (Agnus Dei), the Communion Antiphon and Hymn, and the Prayer after Communion and Solemn Blessing and Dismissal) then proceeds as normal, with the newly ordained to the immediate right of the Bishop and the other celebrants.\\r\\nThe earliest Christians were Jews and Jewish tradition has always deemed the married state as more spiritual than the celibate state.[25] However Christian tradition places a high valuation on chastity as a special gift of God. The life of a priest involves being conformed to Christ. It is known that the Apostle Peter had a spouse from Gospel stories of Peter's mother-in-law sick with fever (Matt 8:14, Mark 1:29, Luke 4:38)[26] and from Paul's mention that Peter took along a believing wife in his ministry (1 Cor 9:5).\\r\\nFrom its beginnings, the idea of clerical celibacy has been contested in canon courts, in theology, and in religious practices. Celibacy for Roman Catholic priests was not mandated under canon law for the universal church until the Second Lateran Council in 1139.[27]\\r\\nThe Council of Elvira in Spain (c. 305ÿ306) was the first council to call for clerical celibacy. In February 385, Pope Siricius wrote the Directa decretal, which was a long letter to Spanish bishop Himerius of Tarragona, replying to the bishops requests on various subjects, which had been sent several months earlier to Pope Damasus I.[28] It was the first of a series of documents published by the Church's magisterium that claimed apostolic origin for clerical celibacy and reminded ministers of the altar of the perpetual continence required.\\r\\nWithin a century of the Great Schism of 1054, the Churches of the East and West arrived at different disciplines as to abstaining from sexual contact during marriage. In the East, candidates for the Priesthood could be married with permission to have regular sexual relations with their wives, but were required to abstain before celebrating the Eucharist. An unmarried person, once ordained, could not marry. Additionally, the Christian East required that, before becoming a bishop, a priest separate from his wife (she was permitted to object), with her typically becoming a nun. In the East, more normally, bishops are chosen from those priests who are monks and are thus unmarried.\\r\\nIn the West, the law of celibacy became mandatory by Pope Gregory VII at the Roman Synod of 1074.[29][30] This law mandated that, in order to become a candidate for ordination, a man could not be married. The law remains in effect in the Latin Church, although not for those who are priests of the Eastern Catholic Churches, who remain under their own discipline. The issue of mandatory celibacy in the Latin Church continues to be debated.[citation needed]\\r\\nThree main aspects to the priesthood: offering the Eucharist, hearing confessions, and counseling.[31] Whilst continuing to hold the importance of these three aspects of priesthood, the church now has a significantly broader understanding. Priests are also responsible for daily recitation of the principal and minor offices of the Liturgy of the Hours.[32] Priests are the only ministers of the Sacrament of Penance[33] and Anointing of the Sick.[34][35] They are the ordinary ministers of Baptism and witnesses to Holy Matrimony.[36]\\r\\nWorldwide, the number of priests has remained fairly steady since 1970, decreasing by about 5,000. This stagnation is due to a balance of large growth in Africa and Asia and a significant decrease in North America and Europe.","input":"What are the different kinds of catholic priests?"},{"output":"Rafael Nadal","context":"The French Open is an annual tennis tournament held over two weeks in May and June. Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France,[1] the French Open is one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

The current champion is Rafael Nadal who beat Dominic Thiem in the 2018 final to win his eleventh French Open title.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe French Open was established in 1891 and was originally known as the French Championships. The tournament was only open to French players or foreign players who were a member of a French club during the first 34 years of its existence.[8] The first winner of the Championship was the British player H. Briggs, a member of Club Stade Fran?ais which entitled him to compete.[9] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[10] Between 1924 and 1932 the title was won by a member of The Four Musketeers. The championship started to attract the best players after it became an international event in 1925, which was won by Ren Lacoste. France's victory in the 1927 Davis Cup increased interest in the tournament and required a new stadium to be built. Previously the tournament had alternated between Racing Club and La Faisanderie, before the Stade Roland Garros was built in 1928.[11] Henri Cochet won the first tournament at the new venue.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nJack Crawford's victory in 1933 was the first time a foreign player had won the tournament since 1891. Following his victory, no French players won the title up until 1940, when the tournament was suspended following the outbreak of the Second World War. Don Budge's victory in 1938 was notable, as he won all of the Grand Slam tournaments during the year.[13] Though the event was suspended in 1940, it was held unofficially under the guise of the Tournoi de France. Bernard Destremau won the first two events, while Yvon Petra won three from 1942 to 1945. These results are not recognised by the FFT or other major international organisations and are considered unofficial.[4] Marcel Bernard won the first event after the end of the war in 1946; he was the only Frenchman to win the event before the advent of the Open era in 1968.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nNo one player dominated the event during this period. Only five players, Frank Parker, Jaroslav Drobny, Tony Trabert, Nicola Pietrangeli and Roy Emerson, won multiple titles.[10] The tournament became an Open in 1968, as professional players were allowed to compete with amateurs, previously only amateurs could compete in the Grand Slam tournaments.[14] The tournament, won by Australian Ken Rosewall, was the first Grand Slam tournament to be played in the Open era.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nSwede Bj?rn Borg won the majority of the tournaments in the early years of the Open era.

It is a part of the auditory system, performing basic and higher functions in hearing, such as possible relations to language switching.[1][2]\\r\\nIt is located bilaterally, roughly at the upper sides of the temporal lobes ÿ in humans on the superior temporal plane, within the lateral fissure and comprising parts of Heschl's gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus, including planum polare and planum temporale (roughly Brodmann areas 41, 42, and partially 22).[3][4] Unilateral destruction results in slight hearing loss, whereas bilateral destruction results in cortical deafness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe auditory cortex was previously subdivided into primary (A1) and secondary (A2) projection areas and further association areas. The modern divisions of the auditory cortex are the core (which includes A1), the belt, and the parabelt. The belt is the area immediately surrounding the core; the parabelt is adjacent to the lateral side of the belt.[5]\\r\\nBesides receiving input from the ears via lower parts of the auditory system, it also transmits signals back to these areas and is interconnected with other parts of the cerebral cortex.\\r\\nData about the auditory cortex has been obtained through studies in rodents, cats, macaques, and other animals. In humans, the structure and function of the auditory cortex has been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocorticography.[6][7]\\r\\nLike many areas in the neocortex, the functional properties of the adult primary auditory cortex (A1) are highly dependent on the sounds encountered early in life. This has been best studied using animal models, especially cats and rats. In the rat, exposure to a single frequency during postnatal day (P) 11 to 13 can cause a 2-fold expansion in the representation of that frequency in A1.[8] Importantly, the change is persistent, in that it lasts throughout the animal's life, and specific, in that the same exposure outside of that period causes no lasting change in the tonotopy of A1.\\r\\nAs with other primary sensory cortical areas, auditory sensations reach perception only if received and processed by a cortical area. Evidence for this comes from lesion studies in human patients who have sustained damage to cortical areas through tumors or strokes,[9] or from animal experiments in which cortical areas were deactivated by surgical lesions or other methods.[10] Damage to the Primary Auditory Cortex in humans leads to a loss of any awareness of sound, but an ability to react reflexively to sounds remains as there is a great deal of subcortical processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain.[11][12][13]\\r\\nNeurons in the auditory cortex are organized according to the frequency of sound to which they respond best. Neurons at one end of the auditory cortex respond best to low frequencies; neurons at the other respond best to high frequencies. There are multiple auditory areas (much like the multiple areas in the visual cortex), which can be distinguished anatomically and on the basis that they contain a complete \\"frequency map.\\" The purpose of this frequency map (known as a tonotopic map) is unknown, and is likely to reflect the fact that the cochlea is arranged according to sound frequency. The auditory cortex is involved in tasks such as identifying and segregating auditory \\"objects\\" and identifying the location of a sound in space.\\r\\nHuman brain scans have indicated that a peripheral bit of this brain region is active when trying to identify musical pitch. Individual cells consistently get excited by sounds at specific frequencies, or multiples of that frequency.\\r\\nThe auditory cortex plays an important yet ambiguous role in hearing. When the auditory information passes into the cortex, the specifics of what exactly takes place are unclear. There is a large degree of individual variation in the auditory cortex, as noted by biologist James Beament, who wrote, The cortex is so complex that the most we may ever hope for is to understand it in principle, since the evidence we already have suggests that no two cortices work in precisely the same way.\\"[14]\\r\\nIn the hearing process, multiple sounds are transduced simultaneously. The role of the auditory system is to decide which components form the sound link. Many have surmised that this linkage is based on the location of sounds. However, there are numerous distortions of sound when reflected off different media, which makes this thinking unlikely[citation needed]. The auditory cortex forms groupings based on fundamentals; in music, for example, this would include harmony, timing, and pitch.[15]\\r\\nThe primary auditory cortex lies in the superior temporal gyrus of the temporal lobe and extends into the lateral sulcus and the transverse temporal gyri (also called Heschl's gyri). Final sound processing is then performed by the parietal and frontal lobes of the human cerebral cortex. Animal studies indicate that auditory fields of the cerebral cortex receive ascending input from the auditory thalamus, and that they are interconnected on the same and on the opposite cerebral hemispheres.\\r\\nThe auditory cortex is composed of fields which differ from each other in both structure and function.[16] The number of fields varies in different species, from as few as 2 in rodents to as many as 15 in the rhesus monkey. The number, location, and organization of fields in the human auditory cortex are not known at this time. What is known about the human auditory cortex comes from a base of knowledge gained from studies in mammals, including primates, used to interpret electrophysiological tests and functional imaging studies of the brain in humans.\\r\\nWhen each instrument of a symphony orchestra or the jazz band plays the same note, the quality of each sound is different  but the musician perceives each note as having the same pitch. The neurons of the auditory cortex of the brain are able to respond to pitch. Studies in the marmoset monkey have shown that pitch-selective neurons are located in a cortical region near the anterolateral border of the primary auditory cortex. This location of a pitch-selective area has also been identified in recent functional imaging studies in humans.[17][18]\\r\\nThe primary auditory cortex is subject to modulation by numerous neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine, which has been shown to decrease cellular excitability in all layers of the temporal cortex. alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activation, by norepinephrine, decreases glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic potentials at AMPA receptors.[19]\\r\\nThe auditory cortex is the most highly organized processing unit of sound in the brain. This cortex area is the neural crux of hearing, andin humanslanguage and music. The auditory cortex is divided into three separate parts: the primary, secondary, and tertiary auditory cortex. These structures are formed concentrically around one another, with the primary cortex in the middle and the tertiary cortex on the outside.\\r\\nThe primary auditory cortex is tonotopically organized, which means that neighboring cells in the cortex respond to neighboring frequencies.[20] Tonotopic mapping is preserved throughout most of the audition circuit. The primary auditory cortex receives direct input from the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus and thus is thought to identify the fundamental elements of music, such as pitch and loudness.\\r\\nAn evoked response study of congenitally deaf kittens by Klinke et al. utilized local field potentials to measure cortical plasticity in the auditory cortex. These kittens were stimulated and measured against a control (an un-stimulated congenitally deaf cat (CDC)) and normal hearing cats. The field potentials measured for artificially stimulated CDC were eventually much stronger than that of a normal hearing cat.[21] This finding accords with a study by Eckart Altenmullers, in which it was observed that students who received musical instruction had greater cortical activation than those who did not.[22]\\r\\nThe auditory cortex has distinct responses to sounds in the gamma band. When subjects are exposed to three or four cycles of a 40 hertz click, an abnormal spike appears in the EEG data, which is not present for other stimuli. The spike in neuronal activity correlating to this frequency is not restrained to the tonotopic organization of the auditory cortex. It has been theorized that gamma frequencies are resonant frequencies of certain areas of the brain, and appear to affect the visual cortex as well.[23] Gamma band activation (25 to 100?Hz) has been shown to be present during the perception of sensory events and the process of recognition. In a 2000 study by Kneif and colleagues, subjects were presented with eight musical notes to well-known tunes, such as Yankee Doodle and Frre Jacques. Randomly, the sixth and seventh notes were omitted and an electroencephalogram, as well as a magnetoencephalogram were each employed to measure the neural results. Specifically, the presence of gamma waves, induced by the auditory task at hand, were measured from the temples of the subjects. The OSP response, or omitted stimulus response, was located in a slightly different position; 7?mm more anterior, 13?mm more medial and 13?mm more superior in respect to the complete sets. The OSP recordings were also characteristically lower in gamma waves, as compared to the complete musical set. The evoked responses during the sixth and seventh omitted notes are assumed to be imagined, and were characteristically different, especially in the right hemisphere.[24] The right auditory cortex has long been shown to be more sensitive to tonality, while the left auditory cortex has been shown to be more sensitive to minute sequential differences in sound, such as in speech.\\r\\nTonality is represented in more places than just the auditory cortex; one other specific area is the rostromedial prefrontal cortex (RMPFC).[25] Janata et al., in their 2002 study, explored the areas of the brain which were active during tonality processing, by means of the fMRI technique. The results of this experiment showed preferential blood-oxygen-level dependent activation of specific voxels in RMPFC for specific tonal arrangements. Though these collections of voxels do not represent the same tonal arrangements between subjects or within subjects over multiple trials, it is interesting and informative that RMPFC, an area not usually associated with audition, seems to code for immediate tonal arrangements in this respect. RMPFC is a subsection of the medial prefrontal cortex, which projects to many diverse areas including the amygdala, and is thought to aid in the inhibition of negative emotion.[26]","input":"Where are auditory signals processed in the brain?"},{"output":"North America","context":"During the Cold War, Canada was one of the western powers playing a central role in the major alliances. It was an ally of the United States, but there were several foreign policy differences between the two countries over the course of the Cold War.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958 and played a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping operations ÿ from the Korean War to the creation of a permanent UN peacekeeping force during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Subsequent peacekeeping interventions occurred in the Congo (1960), Cyprus (1964), the Sinai (1973), Vietnam (with the International Control Commission), Golan Heights, Lebanon (1978), and Namibia (1989ÿ1990).\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada did not follow the American lead in all Cold War actions, sometimes leading to tensions. Canada refused to join the Vietnam War and in 1984 the last nuclear weapons based in Canada were removed. Relations were maintained with Cuba and the Canadian government recognized the People's Republic of China before the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Canadian military maintained a standing presence in Western Europe as part of its NATO deployment at several bases in Germany ÿ including long tenures at CFB Baden-Soellingen and CFB Lahr, in the Black Forest region of West Germany. Also Canadian military facilities were maintained in Bermuda, France and the United Kingdom. From the early 1960s until the 1980s, Canada maintained weapon platforms armed with nuclear weapons ÿ including nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets, surface-to-air missiles, and high-yield gravity bombs principally deployed in the Western European theatre of operations as well as in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada emerged from the Second World War as a world power, radically transforming a principally agricultural and rural dominion of a dying empire into a truly sovereign nation, with a market economy focused on a combination of resource extraction and refinement, heavy manufacturing, and high-technology research and development. As a consequence of supplying so much of the war effort for six long years, Canada's military grew to an exceptional size: over a million service personnel, the world's third largest surface fleet and fourth largest air force. Despite a draw-down at the end of the war, the Canadian military nonetheless executed Operation Muskox, a massive deployment across the Canadian Arctic designed in part to train for a ground and air war in the region. Canadians also assisted in humanitarian efforts, and sending observers for the United Nations to India and Palestine in 1947 and 1948.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was never any doubt early on as to which side Canada was on in the Cold War due to its location. On the domestic front, the Canadian state at all levels fought vehemently against what it characterized as communist subversion. Canadian and business leaders opposed the advance of the labour movement on the grounds that it was a Bolshevik conspiracy during the interwar period. The peak moments of this effort were the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and the anticommunist campaigns of the depression, including the stopping of the On-to-Ottawa Trek. The formal onset of the Cold War, usually pegged with the 1945 defection of a Soviet cipher clerk working in Ottawa, Igor Gouzenko, was therefore a continuation and extension of, rather than a departure from, Canadian anticommunist policies.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada was a founding member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), of which Prime Minister St. Laurent was a chief architect.  Canada was one of its most ardent supporters and pushed (largely unsuccessfully) to have it become an economic and cultural organization in addition to a military alliance.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt played a middle power role in international affairs, and pursued diplomatic relations with Communist countries that the US had severed ties with, such as Cuba and China after their respective revolutions. Canada argued that rather than being soft on Communism, it was pursuing a strategy of \\"constructive engagement\\" whereby it sought to influence Communism through the course of its international relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada had far less of the anti-Communist hysteria that had afflicted the United States.  The United States wished the Canadian government would go further, asking for a purging of trade unions, but Canada saw this as American hysteria, and left the purge of trade unions to the AFL-CIO. The American officials were especially concerned about the sailors on Great Lakes freight vessels, and, in 1951, Canada added them to those already screened by its secret anti-communist screening program. The Communist Party of Canada had not been outlawed since Section 98 was repealed by Prime Minister Mackenzie King in 1935.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its comparatively moderate stance towards Communism, the Canadian state continued intensive surveillance of Communists and sharing of intelligence with the US. PROFUNC was a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain Communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nTensions between Canada and the United States heightened during this time as on April 4, 1957, Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, E. Herbert Norman, leaped to his death from a Cairo building after the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security released a textual record of a previous hearing to the media. Despite having been cleared several years earlier, first by the RCMP in 1950, then again by the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson, the United States media portrayed Norman as a spy and traitor. The only evidence the United States had was that as a student at Cambridge and Harvard he was a part of a Marxist communist study group. This made Pearson, who was still External Affairs Minister, backed by outrage across the country, send a note to the US Government, threatening to offer no more security information on Canadian citizens until it was guaranteed that this information would not slip beyond the executive branch of the government.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during the Cold War period that Canada began to assert the international clout that went along with the reputation it had built on the international stage in World War I and World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Korean War, the moderately sized contingent of volunteer soldiers from Canada made noteworthy contributions to the United Nations forces and served with distinction.  Of particular note is the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's contribution to the Battle of Kapyong.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada's major Cold War contribution to international politics was made in the innovation and implementation of 'Peacekeeping'.  Although a United Nations military force had been proposed and advocated for the preservation of peace vis a vis the U.N.'s mandate by Canada's representatives Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his Secretary of State for External Affairs Louis St. Laurent at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in June 1945, it was not adopted at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Suez Crisis of 1956, the idea promoted by Canada in 1945 of a United Nations military force returned to the fore.  The conflict involving Britain, France, Israel and Egypt quickly developed into a potential flashpoint between the emerging 'superpowers' of the United States and the Soviet Union as the Soviets made intimations that they would militarily support Egypt's cause.  The Soviets went as far as to say they would be willing to use \\"all types of modern weapons of destruction\\" on London and Paris ÿ an overt threat of nuclear attack.  Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson re-introduced then Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's UN military force concept in the form of an 'Emergency Force' that would intercede and divide the combatants, and form a buffer zone or 'human shield' between the opposing forces.  Pearson's United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) ÿ the first peacekeeping force, was deployed to separate the combatants and a cease-fire and resolution was drawn up to end the hostilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo defend North America against a possible enemy attack, Canada and the United States began to work very closely together in the 1950s. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) created a joint air-defense system.  In northern Canada, the Distant Early Warning Line (Dew Line) was established to give warning of Soviet bombers heading over the north pole.  Great debate broke out while John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister as to whether Canada should accept U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory.  Diefenbaker had already agreed to buy the BOMARC missile system from the Americans, which would be not as effective without nuclear warheads, but balked at permitting the weapons into Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada also maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution. Prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the insistence on a much more placated policy towards the Cuban government had been a source of contention between the United States and Canada.[4] Prime Minister Diefenbaker firmly stood by his policy decision, insisting that this was the result of the rights of states to establish their own forms of government, rejection of current US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine as well as Canada's right to establish its own foreign policy.[4]  Concern in the Canadian government was focused primarily on nuclear weapons, many politicians in the opposition and in power believed that as long as the US president retained absolute control of the nuclear weapons, Canadian forces could be ordered to undertake nuclear missions for the US without Canadian consent.[5] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Canada was expected to fall in line with American foreign policy, in that Canada's military forces were expected to go on immediate war alert status.[6]  Diefenbaker however, refused to do so emphasizing the need for United Nations intervention.[6] It would only be after a tense phone call between President John F. Kennedy and Diefenbaker that Canada's armed forces would begin preparations for \\"immediate enemy attack\\".[6] Although the crisis would eventually be solved by diplomatic talks between Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy, nothing would loom larger over the Canadian state in the months following the crisis than the governing party's disarray on the question of nuclear arms.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1963 Canadian election, Diefenbaker was replaced by the famed diplomat Lester B. Pearson, who accepted the warheads.  Further tensions developed when Pearson criticized the American role in the Vietnam War in a speech he gave at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See also Canada and the Vietnam War.\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada also refused to join the Organization of American States, disliking the support and tolerance of the Cold War OAS for dictators. Under Pearson's successor Pierre Trudeau, US-Canadian policies grew further apart. Trudeau removed nuclear weapons from Canadian soil, formally recognized the People's Republic of China, established a personal friendship with Castro, and decreased the number of Canadian troops stationed at NATO bases in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan had a close relationship, but the 1980s also saw widespread protests against American testing of cruise missiles in Canada's north.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Cold War ended, Canadian Forces were withdrawn from their NATO commitments in Germany, military spending was cut, and air raid sirens were removed across the country. The Diefenbunkers, Canada's military-operated fallout shelters designed to ensure continuity of government, were decommissioned. In 1994, the last active United States military base in Canada, Naval Station Argentia Newfoundland, was decommissioned and the facility was turned over to the Government of Canada. The base was a storage facility for the Mk 101 Lulu and B57 nuclear bombs[8] and a key node in the US Navy's SOSUS network to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. Canada continues to participate in Cold War institutions such as NORAD and NATO, but they have been given new missions and priorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, Canada may have played a small role in helping to bring about glasnost and perestroika. In the mid-1970s, Alexander Yakovlev was appointed as ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. During this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two began, tentatively at first, to discuss the need for liberalisation in the Soviet Union. Yakovlev then returned to Moscow, and would eventually be called the \\"godfather of glasnost\\",[9] the intellectual force behind Gorbachev's reform program.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1987, Canada released a long-awaited White Paper on Defence;[10] signalling its intent to re-assert sovereignty over its Arctic Waters. Concerned that Soviet submarines were operating in Canada's Arctic Archipelago, several programs were proposed to close the gap between Canada's current capabilities and its commitments to NATO. Project Spinnaker was born, a joint CanadaÿUS endeavour whose secret purpose was to provide the capability to monitor submarine traffic in Canadian Arctic waters by deploying acoustic listening posts on the seafloor. This project required the development of a large autonomous underwater vehicle ÿ named Theseus ÿ whose sole purpose was to lay communications trunk cables on the seafloor in waters with a permanent ice cover. In the spring of 1996, Theseus was transported to CFS Alert (on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island) then was deployed from an ice camp where it laid 180km of fibre optic cable on the seafloor in ice-covered waters, successfully delivering it to an acoustic array deployed on the edge of the Continental Shelf.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cold War in Canada came to an end during the period 1990ÿ1995 as the traditional mission to contain Soviet expansion faded into the new realities of warfare. The Cold War required permanent foreign deployments to Western Europe, something which was no longer necessary, and as such bases closed down. Less equipment was needed, and so much was sold off, soon to be replaced by newer equipment designed for future conflicts. At home, bases were closed and operations consolidated and streamlined for maximum efficiency, as by the early 1990s many Canadians were openly questioning the necessity of large defence budgets.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Canadian troops were deployed to assist provincial police in Qubec in an effort to defuse tensions between Mohawk Warriors and the Suret du Qubec and local residents. In 1991 Canadian Forces personnel deployed in support of the American liberation of Kuwait. By 1992, Canadian peacekeepers were deployed to Cambodia, Croatia and Somalia. In 1993 Balkan involvement expanded into Bosnia and Canadian troops participated in some of the fiercest combat since the Korean War during Operation Medak Pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the 1990s, Canada would have a completely different military, one more inclined towards the rigours of peacekeeping and peace-making operations under multi-national coalitions. The country would be further involved in the Yugoslav Wars throughout the rest of the decade, would become involved in Haiti, and would further see action again in Zaire and East Timor. The Navy, by decade's end (and prior to the modern post-9/11 era), was comparatively brand new, the Air Force well-balanced and modern as well. The Army began to acquire new equipment, such as the LAV-III, Bison APC and the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle as it transitioned to fighting irregular warfare instead of the large tank battles once feared would rage across Western Europe. It is with Canada's late-Cold War and early-Peacekeeping Era military that Canada would embark on its deployment to Afghanistan, currently Canada's longest-running war.","input":"Where was canada during the cold war geographically-speaking?"},{"output":"18 years or older","context":"In the United States, there is no federal law regulating the practice of tattooing.

It is resident through most of eastern and central United States, although western populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also found in Newfoundland, Canada, while breeding populations can be found in southern Canada. It breeds in both deciduous and coniferous forests, and is common near and in residential areas. It is predominantly blue with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest. It has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Sexes are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies of the blue jay are recognized.\\r\\nThe blue jay mainly feeds on nuts and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and occasionally small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays are known to hide nuts for later consumption.[2] It builds an open cup nest in the branches of a tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8ÿ12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.\\r\\nThe bird's name derives from its noisy, garrulous nature.[3] It is sometimes called a \\"jaybird\\".[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe blue jay was first described as Pica glandaria c?rulea cristata in English naturalist Mark Catesby's 1731 publication of Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahamas.[5] It was later described as Corvus cristatus in Carl Linnaeus' 1758 edition of Systema Naturae.[6] In the 19th century, the jay was described by French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838 as Cyanocorax cristatus in A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America,[7] and given its modern scientific name Cyanocitta cristata by Hugh Edwin Strickland in 1845.[8] The genus name Cyanocitta derives from the Greek words 'kyaneos' (blue) and the 'kitta' and 'kissa' (chattering bird, jay), and the term 'blue chatterer' refers to the bright blue plumage of the head, nape, back, and tail of the bird. The specific name cristata (crested, tufted) derives from Latin referring to the prominent blue crest of the jay.[9]\\r\\nThe blue jay measures 22ÿ30?cm (9ÿ12?in) from bill to tail and weighs 70ÿ100?g (2.5ÿ3.5?oz), with a wingspan of 34ÿ43?cm (13ÿ17?in).[10][11] Jays from Connecticut averaged 92.4?g (3.26?oz) in mass, while jays from southern Florida averaged 73.7?g (2.60?oz).[12][13] There is a pronounced crest on the head, a crown of feathers, which may be raised or lowered according to the bird's mood. When excited or aggressive, the crest will be fully raised. When frightened, the crest bristles outwards, brushlike. When the bird is feeding among other jays or resting, the crest is flattened on the head.[14]\\r\\nIts plumage is lavender-blue to mid-blue in the crest, back, wings, and tail, and its face is white. The underside is off-white and the neck is collared with black which extends to the sides of the head. The wing primaries and tail are strongly barred with black, sky-blue and white. The bill, legs, and eyes are all black. Males and females are almost identical, but the male is slightly larger.[11][15]\\r\\nAs with most other blue-hued birds, the blue jay's coloration is not derived from pigments but is the result of light interference due to the internal structure of the feathers;[16] if a blue feather is crushed, the blue disappears because the structure is destroyed.[10] This is referred to as structural coloration.\\r\\nThe blue jay occurs from southern Canada through the eastern and central United States south to Florida and northeastern Texas. The western edge of the range stops where the arid pine forest and scrub habitat of the closely related Steller's jay (C. stelleri) begins. Recently, the range of the blue jay has extended northwestwards so that it is now a rare but regularly seen winter visitor along the northern US and southern Canadian Pacific Coast.[10] As the two species' ranges now overlap, C. cristata may sometimes hybridize with Steller's jay.[17] The increase in trees throughout the Great Plains during the past century due to fire suppression and tree planting facilitated the western range expansion of the blue jay[18][19] as well as range expansions of many other species of birds.[20][21][22]\\r\\nThe northernmost subspecies C. c. bromia is migratory, subject to necessity. It may withdraw several hundred kilometres south in the northernmost parts of its range. Thousands of blue jays have been observed to migrate in flocks along the Great Lakes and Atlantic coasts. It migrates during the daytime, in loose flocks of 5 to 250 birds. Much about their migratory behavior remains a mystery. Some are present throughout winter in all parts of their range. Young jays may be more likely to migrate than adults, but many adults also migrate. Some individual jays migrate south one year, stay north the next winter, and then migrate south again the next year. To date, no one has concretely worked out why they migrate when they do. Likely, it is related to weather conditions and how abundant the winter food sources are, which can determine whether other northern birds will move south.[23]\\r\\nThe blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the pine woods of Florida to the spruce-fir forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches.[14] It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale deforestation with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.[24]\\r\\nFour subspecies are generally accepted, though the variation within this species is rather subtle and essentially clinal. No firm boundaries can be drawn between the inland subspecies. The ranges of the coastal races are better delimited.[15]\\r\\nCyanocitta cristata cristata in Johnston County, North Carolina\\r\\nC. c. cristata in Ash, North Carolina\\r\\nC. c. cyanotephra in DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge, Iowa\\r\\nC. c. semplei, a small form, in Collier County, Florida\\r\\nC. c. bromia in Muskoka Lakes, Ontario\\r\\nC. c. bromia, Northern blue jay, juvenile, in Ontario, Canada\\r\\nC. c. bromia, Northern blue jay in Ontario, Canada\\r\\nThe blue jay is a noisy, bold and aggressive passerine. It is a moderately slow flier (roughly 32ÿ40?km/h (20ÿ25?mph)) when unprovoked.[25] It flies with body and tail held level, with slow wing beats. Due to its slow flying speeds, this species makes easy prey for hawks and owls when flying in open areas. Virtually all the raptorial birds sympatric in distribution with the blue jay may prey upon it, especially swift bird-hunting specialists such as the Accipiter hawks. Diverse predators may prey on jay eggs and young up to their fledging stage, including tree squirrels, snakes, cats, crows, raccoons, opossums, other jays and possibly many of the same birds of prey who attack adults.[26]\\r\\nThe blue jay can be beneficial to other bird species, as it may chase predatory birds, such as hawks and owls, and will scream if it sees a predator within its territory. It has also been known to sound an alarm call when hawks or other dangers are near, and smaller birds often recognize this call and hide themselves away accordingly. It may occasionally impersonate the calls of raptors, especially those of the red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks, possibly to test if a hawk is in the vicinity, though also possibly to scare off other birds that may compete for food sources.[23] It may also be aggressive towards humans who come close to its nest, and if an owl roosts near the nest during the daytime the blue jay mobs it until it takes a new roost. However, blue jays have also been known to attack or kill other smaller birds and sleeping, foliage-roosting bat species such as Lasiurus borealis.[27] Jays are very territorial birds, and they will chase others from a feeder for an easier meal. Additionally, the blue jay may raid other birds' nests, stealing eggs, chicks, and nests. However, this may not be as common as is typically thought, as only 1% of food matter in one study was bird material.[23] Despite this, other passerines may still mob jays who come within their breeding territories.\\r\\nBlue jays, like other corvids, are highly curious and are considered intelligent birds. Young individuals playfully snatch brightly coloured or reflective objects, such as bottle caps or pieces of aluminum foil, and carry them around until they lose interest.[27] While not confirmed to have engaged in tool use in the wild, blue jays in captivity have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food,[23][28] while captive fledglings have been observed attempting to open the doors of their cages.[29]\\r\\nBlue jays have strong black bills which they use for cracking nuts, usually while holding them with their feet, and for eating corn, grains and seeds. Its food is sought both on the ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings.[23] Blue jays will sometimes cache food, though to what extent differs widely among individuals.[30] Although seemingly contentious in their general behavior, Blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium-sized birds who visit bird-feeders. In Florida, Blue jays were dominated at feeders by Eastern gray squirrels, Florida scrub-jays, common grackles and red-headed woodpeckers, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.[23]\\r\\nThe mating season begins in mid-March, peaks in mid-April to May, and extends into July. Any suitable tree or large bush may be used for nesting, though an evergreen is preferred. The nest is preferentially built at a height in the trees of 3 to 10?m (9.8 to 32.8?ft). It is cup-shaped and composed of twigs, small roots, bark strips, moss, other plant material, cloth, paper, and feathers, with occasional mud added to the cup.\\r\\nBlue jays are not very picky about nesting locations. If no better place is available ÿ e.g. in a heavily deforested area ÿ they will even use places like the large mailboxes typical of the rural United States.[24] They also appropriate nests of other mid-sized songbirds as long as these are placed in suitable spots; American robin nests are commonly used by blue jays, for example.\\r\\nBlue jays typically form monogamous pair bonds for life. Both sexes build the nest and rear the young, though only the female broods them. The male feeds the female while she is brooding the eggs. There are usually between 3 and 6 (averaging 4 or 5) eggs laid and incubated over 16ÿ18 days. The young fledge usually between 17ÿ21 days after hatching.[27]\\r\\nAfter the juveniles fledge, the family travels and forages together until early fall, when the young birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay was found to have been around 17 and a half years old.[31] A more common lifespan for wild birds that survive to adulthood is around 7 years.[citation needed] Beyond predation and the occasional collision with man-made objects, a common cause of mortality in recent decades has been the West Nile Virus, which corvids as a whole seem especially susceptible to. However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.[26]\\r\\nBlue jays can make a large variety of sounds, and individuals may vary perceptibly in their calling style. Like other corvids, they may learn to mimic human speech. Blue jays can also copy the cries of local hawks so well that it is sometimes difficult to tell which it is.[32] Their voice is typical of most jays in being varied, but the most commonly recognized sound is the alarm call, which is a loud, almost gull-like scream. There is also a high-pitched jayer-jayer call that increases in speed as the bird becomes more agitated. This particular call can be easily confused with the chickadee's song because of the slow starting chick-ah-dee-ee. Blue jays will use these calls to band together to mob potential predators such as hawks and drive them away from the jays' nests.\\r\\nBlue jays also have quiet, almost subliminal calls which they use among themselves in proximity. One of the most distinctive calls of this type is often referred to as the \\"rusty pump\\" owing to its squeaky resemblance to the sound of an old hand-operated water pump. The blue jay (and other corvids) are distinct from most other songbirds for using their call as a song.\\r\\nIn old African American folklore of the southern United States, the blue jay was held to be a servant of the Devil, and \\"was not encountered on a Friday as he was fetching sticks down to Hell; furthermore, he was so happy and chirpy on a Saturday as he was relieved to return from Hell\\".[33]\\r\\nThe blue jay was adopted as the team symbol of the Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball team, as well as some of their minor league affiliates. Their mascot is Ace, also a blue jay.\\r\\nThe blue jay is featured in Mark Twain's \\"A Tramp Abroad\\", Chapter 3 \\"Baker's Blue-Jay Yarn\\". The blue jay is also the official mascot for Johns Hopkins University and Creighton University.\\r\\nOne of the main protagonists of the Cartoon Network show Regular Show is an anthropomorphic blue jay named Mordecai.\\r\\nThe blue jay is the provincial bird of the province of Prince Edward Island in Canada.","input":"What does a blue jay nest look like?"},{"output":"Officer Francis (\\"Frank\\") Llewellyn \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello","context":"CHiPs is an American television drama series that originally aired on NBC from September 15, 1977, to May 1, 1983. CHiPs followed the lives of two motorcycle police officers of the California Highway Patrol (CHP). The series ran for 139 episodes over six seasons, plus one reunion TV movie from October 27, 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHiPs is an action crime dramedy. Over-the-top freeway pileups, which occurred frequently, especially in the later seasons, were a signature of the show. There was little violence on CHiPs, and the show can be classified as a light drama. The episodes filled a standard hour-long time slot, which at the time required 48 minutes of actual programming. For filming, traffic on Los Angeles freeways was non-existent and most chase scenes were done on back roads, usually dirt roads.\\r\\nThe show was created by Rick Rosner, and starred Erik Estrada as macho, rambunctious Officer Francis (\\"Frank\\") Llewellyn \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello and Larry Wilcox as his straitlaced partner, Officer Jonathan (\\"Jon\\") Andrew Baker. With Ponch the more trouble-prone of the pair, and Jon generally the more level-headed one trying to keep him out of trouble with the duo's gruff yet fatherly commanding officer Sergeant Joseph Getraer (Robert Pine), the two were Highway Patrolmen of the Central Los Angeles office of the California Highway Patrol (CHP, hence the name CHiPs).\\r\\nAs real-life CHP motor officers rarely ride in pairs, in early episodes this was explained away by placing the trouble-prone Ponch on probationary status, with Jon assigned as his field training officer. Eventually, by the end of the first season, this subplot faded away (Ponch completed his probation) as audiences were used to seeing the two working as a team.\\r\\nIn the fifth season (1981ÿ82), Estrada went on strike over a dispute over syndication profits. As a result, he did not appear in seven episodes; for that period he was replaced by Jenner (Officer Steve McLeish).[1][2]\\r\\nDespite their successful pairing on-screen, Wilcox and Estrada did not always get along behind the camera.[3] However, it was Wilcox's falling-out with the producers over what he saw as continual favoritism toward Estrada that saw Wilcox not return for the sixth and final season. Wilcox was replaced by Tom Reilly (Officer Bobby Nelson).\\r\\nBruce Penhall, a native of Balboa Island, Newport Beach and a Motorcycle speedway rider who had won the 1981 and 1982 Speedway World Championships, was also introduced as cadetÿprobationary officer Bruce Nelson, Bobby's younger brother in 1982ÿ83. The season 6 episode \\"Speedway Fever\\" (aired November 7, 1982) centered on Penhall's character Nelson winning the 1982 Speedway World Final at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, with scenes filmed in the pits during the meeting. The episode also used television coverage of the final (with dubbed commentary). Penhall later admitted that having a bodyguard and having to have makeup done in the pits in full view of his competitors at the World Final only added to the pressure he was under both as a rider and a rookie actor and that it felt weird having to \\"buddy up to Ponch\\" in front of the other riders while the World Final was taking place. In order to become a full-time member of the CHiPs cast, Penhall had officially announced his retirement from speedway racing on the podium of the 1982 World Final.\\r\\nEstrada apparently did not approve of Reilly's work ethic[citation needed] and was very displeased with Reilly's real life arrest by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for possession of controlled substances during a traffic stop. As a result, Bobby was featured somewhat less prominently in later episodes of the season, with Bruce becoming Ponch's partner in the third to last episode, \\"Fast Company.\\"\\r\\nAccording to a 1998 TV Guide article, show creator Rick Rosner was a reserve deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.[citation needed] During a coffee break on an evening patrol shift in the mid-1970s he saw two young CHP officers on motorcycles which gave him the idea for this series. He later created 240-Robert, which seemed like a hybrid of CHiPs and Emergency!.[citation needed]\\r\\nEpisodes occasionally reference Jon Baker's service in Vietnam. This makes his character one of the earliest regular (and one of the more positive) portrayals of a Vietnam veteran on television.[citation needed] Larry Wilcox served 13?months in Vietnam as a Marine artilleryman.\\r\\nDespite the Ford Motor Company's credit as a vehicle provider for nearly 4?of the series' 6?seasons, cars and trucks were supplied by several manufacturers; many of the police cars seen were Dodge models.\\r\\nAlthough doubles were used for far-off shots and various stunt or action sequences, Wilcox and Estrada did a great deal of their own motorcycle riding, and performed many smaller stunts themselves. Although Wilcox emerged relatively injury-free, Estrada suffered various injuries several times throughout the run of the series. In several early first season episodes, a huge bruise or scar can be seen on his arm after he was flung from one of the motorcycles and skidded along the ground. But his worst accident came when he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident while filming a season three episode in August 1979, fracturing several ribs and breaking both wrists. The accident and Estrada's subsequent hospitalization was incorporated into the series' storyline.\\r\\nPrior to being cast in CHiPs Estrada had no experience with motorcycles, so he underwent an intensive eight-week course, learning how to ride. In 2007 it was revealed that he did not hold a motorcycle license at the time CHiPs was in production, and only qualified for a license after three attempts, while preparing for an appearance on the reality television show Back to the Grind.\\r\\nEstrada and Wilcox never drew their firearms over the course of the series. (This did occur in \\"National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1\\" and in the made-for-TV reunion movie CHiPs '99.) The only character on the series depicted as drawing his firearm was Baricza (Brodie Greer), and he did so three times. The first was his radio car's Ithaca 37 shotgun in season 1's episode \\"Rainy Day\\",[4] where the CHiPs conduct a felony traffic stop of a motorhome-based casino.[5] The second was in season 2's premiere, \\"Peaks and Valleys\\", against two hillbillies armed with a Tommy-gun and a double-barrel shotgun who had ambushed his unattended patrol car for fun. Here the action was only implied, with his hand motion just below camera range. The last was in season 4's \\"Karate\\", in which a karate-trained car burglar (Danny Bonaduce) attacked him with a B, but Baricza drew his gun to stop Bonaduce.\\r\\nNBC aired reruns of this series on its 1982 daytime schedule from April to September.\\r\\nDuring the original run of the series, syndicated reruns of older episodes were retitled CHiPs Patrol to avoid confusion.[6] Later syndicated reruns after the show went out of production reverted to the original title.\\r\\nCHiPs episodes were usually a combination of light comedy and drama. A typical episode would start with Ponch and Jon on routine patrol or being assigned to an interesting beat, such as Malibu or the Sunset Strip. In roll call briefing, Sgt. Getraer would alert his officers to be on the lookout for a particular criminal operation, such as people staging accidents as part of an insurance scam or punks breaking into cars. A few interesting, unrelated vignettes often transpired during \\"routine\\" traffic enforcement.\\r\\nA light-hearted subplot would also be included, such as Harlan trying to hide a stray dog from Getraer at the office. A more serious theme, such as Ponch trying to keep a kid from his old neighborhood out of a potential life of crime, might also be included. After a few failed attempts to apprehend the gang that had been menacing L.A.'s freeways, the episode would invariably culminate in Ponch and Jon leading a chase of the suspects (often assisted by other members of their division), climaxing with a spectacular series of stunt vehicle crashes.\\r\\nThe show then typically featured a dnouement of Ponch and Jon participating in a new activity (such as jet skiing or skydiving), designed to showcase the pair's glamorous Southern California lifestyle. Often, Ponch would attempt to impress a woman he had met during the episode with his athletic prowess or disco dancing, only to fail and provide Jon, Getraer, and others with many laughs. As the preliminary end credits would start, the image would freeze multiple times, showing various characters laughing or otherwise enjoying the social scene.\\r\\nSome of the more outlandish plots included Ponch and his Season 6 partner Bobby Nelson helping a girl who believed that she was being targeted by UFOs and them racing against time to defuse a battery about to explode on an intelligent experimental police robot.\\r\\nCHP Officers almost never drew their guns in the series; in the TV Movie however, guns were used more prominently, especially in one of the final scenes in which Jon and McFall are held hostage on a tour bus, the entire CHP are shown holding guns at the bus.\\r\\n(all times Eastern/Pacific Time; subtract one hour for Central/Mountain Time)\\r\\nNBC aired reruns of the series weekdays at 3PM EST between April 26, 1982 ÿ September 10, 1982 Currently the show airs on Me-TV.\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the series was broadcast by ITV but was not simulcast nationally. The series started in January 1979 in the London region, but began with Season Two (the first episode shown was episode 2x02 \\"The Volunteers\\") by February most other ITV regions originally screened in the Saturday tea-time slot around 17:35 but moved to the Sunday teatime slot in 1980. By 1981, as with many imported programmes of the era, the series was being broadcast at different times during the weekend throughout the year by the different ITV regions. The series shared its Saturday teatime slot with other series such as The A-Team, Knight Rider, Magnum, P.I. and Whiz Kids.\\r\\nDuring 1984, most ITV station continued with the Saturday teatime slot except for Anglia Television, Scottish Television (STV) and Television South West (TSW), who broadcast episodes during the weekend mornings or Sunday afternoons. By early 1985, the series was being broadcast during Saturday mornings by Anglia, Central, Grampian, Granada, STV and Tyne Tees, who all completed the series by end of the 1985. HTV and Yorkshire completed the series by 1986, while LWT, TVS and TSW finished series six in 1987 after starting in 1985. A few companies repeated the series in 1987.\\r\\nThe entire series was shown in New Zealand on TVNZ in the 1980s.\\r\\nCHiPs debuted in France on channel Antenne 2 as an eight-episode mini-series beginning September 18, 1983 at 2:25pm. The episodes included in the mini-series are from season 1 and 2. On April 24, 1986, CHiPs began airing on La Cinq at 8pm. La Cinq aired the first two seasons until August 28, 1987. On May 30, 1988, CHiPs began airing on TF1, showing all episodes of the series.[7]\\r\\nWarner Home Video released the first two seasons of CHiPs on DVD in Regions 1,?2?&?4 between 2007/2008. On March 3, 2015 (over 6?years later), the third season was released on DVD in Region 1.[8] The fourth season was released in Region 1 on March 15, 2016.[9] The fifth season was released in Region 1 on March 14, 2017.[10][11][12] The sixth season and the complete series were released in Region 1 on June 6, 2017.[13]\\r\\nAll 139 episodes are at the iTunes Store.[14][15]\\r\\nCHiPs '99 is a 1998 made-for-television film and a sequel to the series. It was directed by Jon Cassar. Several cast members from the original series make a return. Original cast with promotions were Jon Baker as a Captain and Joe Getraer as the CHP Commissioner. Other original cast members were Officer Frank Poncherello returning from a 15-year hiatus with the CHP, Officer Barry Baricza and Arthur (Artie) \\"Grossie\\" Grossman as a Detective. Bruce Penhall also returns as newly promoted Sergeant Bruce Nelson.\\r\\nIn 2005, a theatrical release motion picture version of the show was announced, starring Wilmer Valderrama as Ponch,[16] though as of 2013 this production was still \\"stalled\\".[17] Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox were rumored to make cameo appearances. In a 2002 episode of MADtv, Valderrama and fellow That '70s Show cast member Danny Masterson were featured in two parodies of CHiPs, which featured the two actors as Ponch and Baker respectively. Mila Kunis also appeared in the second sketch. In a 2002 episode of That '70s Show, Valderrama's character, Fez, was seen in the \\"most likely\\" section of the yearbook as \\"most likely to appear as Ponch in a musical version of CHiPs\\".\\r\\nOn September 2, 2014, Warner Bros. Pictures announced a film adaptation of the show, which Andrew Panay would be producing along with Dax Shepard.[18] Shepard will also write, direct and star in the film as Officer Jon Baker; Michael Pe?a will play Frank \\"Ponch\\" Poncherello while Vincent DOnofrio is in negotiations to play the villain.[19][20]\\r\\nA series of 3?3?4\\" action figures was released by Mego in the late 1970s.

He was developed in the early 1990s and made his first public appearance at the 1995 Pro Bowl[2] as a Team NFL Hero. Team NFL Heroes were a line of mascot-like characters created by NFL Properties for every team in the league; most of the characters only lasted a season or two but a handful ended up being adopted as official mascots by their respective teams, either immediately after the Team NFL Heroes project was canceled or years later with Miles being an example of the latter.

Homologs have the same genes in the same loci where they provide points along each chromosome which enable a pair of chromosomes to align correctly with each other before separating during meiosis.[1] This is the basis for Mendelian inheritance which characterizes inheritance patterns of genetic material from an organism to its offspring parent developmental cell at the given time and area.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChromosomes are linear arrangements of condensed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins, which form a complex called chromatin.[2] Homologous chromosomes are made up of chromosome pairs of approximately the same length, centromere position, and staining pattern, for genes with the same corresponding loci. One homologous chromosome is inherited from the organism's mother; the other is inherited from the organism's father. After mitosis occurs within the daughter cells, they have the correct number of genes which are a mix of the two parents' genes. In diploid (2n) organisms, the genome is composed of one set of each homologous chromosome pair, as compared to tetraploid organisms which may have two sets of each homologous chromosome pair. The alleles on the homologous chromosomes may be different, resulting in different phenotypes of the same genes. This mixing of maternal and paternal traits is enhanced by crossing over during meiosis, wherein lengths of chromosomal arms and the DNA they contain within a homologous chromosome pair are exchanged with one another.[3]\\r\\nEarly in the 1900s William Bateson and Reginald Punnett were studying genetic inheritance and they noted that some combinations of alleles appeared more frequently than others. That data and information was further explored by Thomas Morgan. Using test cross experiments, he revealed that, for a single parent, the alleles of genes near to one another along the length of the chromosome move together. Using this logic he concluded that the two genes he was studying were located on homologous chromosomes. Later on during the 1930s Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock were studying meiosis in corn cells and examining gene loci on corn chromosomes.[2] Creighton and McClintock discovered that the new allele combinations present in the offspring and the event of crossing over were directly related.[2] This proved interchromosomal genetic recombination.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are chromosomes which contain the same genes in the same order along their chromosomal arms. There are two main properties of homologous chromosomes: the length of chromosomal arms and the placement of the centromere [4]\\r\\nThe actual length of the arm, in accordance with the gene locations, is critically important for proper alignment. Centromere placement can be characterized by four main arrangements, consisting of being either metacentric, submetacentric, telocentric, or acrocentric. Both of these properties are the main factors for creating structural homology between chromosomes. Therefore, when two chromosomes of the exact structure exist, they are able to pair together to form homologous chromosomes.[5]\\r\\nSince homologous chromosomes are not identical and do not originate from the same organism, they are different from sister chromatids. Sister chromatids result after DNA replication has occurred, and thus are identical, side-by-side duplicates of each other.[6]\\r\\nHumans have a total of 46 chromosomes, but there are only 22 pairs of homologous autosomal chromosomes. The additional 23rd pair is the sex chromosomes, X and Y. If this pair is made up of an X and Y chromosome, then the pair of chromosomes is not homologous because their size and gene content differ greatly. The 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes contain the same genes but code for different traits in their allelic forms since one was inherited from the mother and one from the father.[7] So humans have two homologous chromosome sets in each cell, meaning humans are diploid organisms.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes are important in the processes of meiosis and mitosis. They allow for the recombination and random segregation of genetic material from the mother and father into new cells.[8]\\r\\nMeiosis is a round of two cell divisions that results in four haploid daughter cells that each contain half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell.[9] It reduces the chromosome number in a germ cell by half by first separating the homologous chromosomes in meiosis I and then the sister chromatids in meiosis II. The process of meiosis I is generally longer than meiosis II because it takes more time for the chromatin to replicate and for the homologous chromosomes to be properly oriented and segregated by the processes of pairing and synapsis in meiosis I.[6] During meiosis, genetic recombination (by random segregation) and crossing over produces daughter cells that each contain different combinations of maternally and paternally coded genes.[9] This recombination of genes allows for the introduction of new allele pairings and genetic variation.[2] Genetic variation among organisms helps make a population more stable by providing a wider range of genetic traits for natural selection to act on.[2]\\r\\nIn prophase I of meiosis I, each chromosome is aligned with its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome consists of two identical chromatids connected by a common centromere.[9] During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other.[9] This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the synaptonemal complex - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths.[6] Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase.[7] Genetic crossing-over, a type of recombination, occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I.[9] In addition, another type of recombination referred to as synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) frequently occurs. SDSA recombination involves information exchange between paired homologous chromatids, but not physical exchange. SDSA recombination does not cause crossing-over.\\r\\nIn the process of crossing-over, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes lengths.[6] Structures called chiasmata are the site of the exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis.[6] Both the non-crossover and crossover types of recombination function as processes for repairing DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks. At the diplotene stage of prophase I the synaptonemal complex disassembles before which will allow the homologous chromosomes to separate, while the sister chromatids stay associated by their centromeres.[6]\\r\\nIn metaphase I of meiosis I, the pairs of homologous chromosomes, also known as bivalents or tetrads, line up in a random order along the metaphase plate.[9] The random orientation is another way for cells to introduce genetic variation. Meiotic spindles emanating from opposite spindle poles attach to each of the homologs (each pair of sister chromatids) at the kinetochore.[7]\\r\\nIn anaphase I of meiosis I the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart from each other. The homologs are cleaved by the enzyme separase to release the cohesin that held the homologous chromosome arms together.[7] This allows the chiasmata to release and the homologs to move to opposite poles of the cell.[7] The homologous chromosomes are now randomly segregated into two daughter cells that will undergo meiosis II to produce four haploid daughter germ cells.[2]\\r\\nAfter the tetrads of homologous chromosomes are separated in meiosis I, the sister chromatids from each pair are separated. The two haploid(because the chromosome no. has reduced to half. Earlier two sets of chromosomes were present, but now each set exists in two different daughter cells that have arisen from the single diploid parent cell by meiosis I) daughter cells resulting from meiosis I undergo another cell division in meiosis II but without another round of chromosomal replication. The sister chromatids in the two daughter cells are pulled apart during anaphase II by nuclear spindle fibers, resulting in four haploid daughter cells.[2]\\r\\nHomologous chromosomes do not function the same in mitosis as they do in meiosis. Prior to every single mitotic division a cell undergoes, the chromosomes in the parent cell replicate themselves. The homologous chromosomes within the cell will ordinarily not pair up and undergo genetic recombination with each other.[9] Instead, the replicants, or sister chromatids, will line up along the metaphase plate and then separate in the same way as meiosis II - by being pulled apart at their centromeres by nuclear mitotic spindles.[10] If any crossing over does occur between sister chromatids during mitosis, it does not produce any new recombinant genotypes.[2]\\r\\nHomologous pairing in most contexts will refer to germline cells, however also takes place in somatic cells. For example, in humans, somatic cells have very tightly regulated homologous pairing (separated into chromosomal territories, and pairing at specific loci under control of developmental signalling). Other species however (notably Drosophila) exhibit homologous pairing much more frequently. Various functions of homologous pairing in somatic cells have been elucidated through high-throughput screens in the early 21st century.\\r\\nThere are severe repercussions when chromosomes do not segregate properly. Faulty segregation can lead to fertility problems, embryo death, birth defects, and cancer.[11] Though the mechanisms for pairing and adhering homologous chromosomes vary among organisms, proper functioning of those mechanisms is imperative in order for the final genetic material to be sorted correctly.[11]\\r\\nProper homologous chromosome separation in meiosis I is crucial for sister chromatid separation in meiosis II.[11] A failure to separate properly is known as nondisjunction. There are two main types of nondisjunction that occur: trisomy and monosomy. Trisomy is caused by the presence of one additional chromosomes in the zygote as compared to the normal number, and monosomy is characterized by the presence of one fewer chromosome in the zygote as compared to the normal number. If this uneven division occurs in meiosis I, then none of the daughter cells will have proper chromosomal distribution and severe effects can ensue, including Downs syndrome.[12] Unequal division can also occur during the second meiotic division. Nondisjunction which occurs at this stage can result in normal daughter cells and deformed cells.[4]\\r\\nWhile the main function of homologous chromosomes is their use in nuclear division, they are also used in repairing double-strand breaks of DNA.[13] These double-stranded breaks may occur in replicating DNA and are most often the result of interaction of DNA with naturally occurring damaging molecules such as reactive oxygen species. Homologous chromosomes can repair this damage by aligning themselves with chromosomes of the same genetic sequence.[13] Once the base pairs have been matched and oriented correctly between the two strands, the homologous chromosomes perform a process that is very similar to recombination, or crossing over as seen in meiosis. Part of the intact DNA sequence overlaps with that of the damaged chromosome's sequence. Replication proteins and complexes are then recruited to the site of damage, allowing for repair and proper replication to occur. Through this functioning, double-strand breaks can be repaired and DNA can function normally.[13]\\r\\nCurrent and future research on the subject of homologous chromosome is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both homologous chromosome synapsis as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis.[14] Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.\\r\\nThere is ongoing research concerning the ability of homologous chromosomes to repair double-strand DNA breaks. Researchers are investigating the possibility of exploiting this capability for regenerative medicine.[15] This medicine could be very prevalent in relation to cancer, as DNA damage is thought to be contributor to carcinogenesis. Manipulating the repair function of homologous chromosomes might allow for bettering a cells damage response system. While research has not yet confirmed the effectiveness of such treatment, it may become a useful therapy for cancer.[16]","input":"When do homologous chromosomes separate from one another?"},{"output":"the Holy See","context":"The United Nations member states are the 193 sovereign states that are members of the United Nations (UN) and have equal representation in the UN General Assembly.[2] The UN is the world's largest intergovernmental organization.\\r\\n The criteria for admission of new members to the UN are set out in Chapter II, Article 4 of the UN Charter:[3]\\r\\nA recommendation for admission from the Security Council requires affirmative votes from at least nine of the council's fifteen members, with none of the five permanent members using their veto power.

This is because the UN does not consider them to possess sovereignty, mainly due to the lack of international recognition or due to opposition from one of the permanent members.\\r\\nIn addition to the member states, the UN also invites non-member states to become observers at the UN General Assembly (currently two: the Holy See and Palestine), allowing them to participate and speak in General Assembly meetings, but not vote. Observers are generally intergovernmental organizations and international organizations and entities whose statehood or sovereignty is not precisely defined.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the United Nations Charter by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (the Republic of China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and a majority of the other signatories.[6] A total of 51 original members (or founding members) joined that year; 50 of them signed the Charter at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco on 26 June 1945, while Poland, which was not represented at the conference, signed it on 15 October 1945.[7][8]\\r\\nThe original members of the United Nations were: France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Byelorussia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Syria, Turkey, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.[8]\\r\\nAmong the original members, 49 are either still UN members or had their memberships in the UN continued by a successor state (see table below); for example, the membership of the Soviet Union was continued by the Russian Federation after its dissolution (see the section Former members: Union of Soviet Socialist Republics). The other two original members, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (i.e., the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), had been dissolved and their memberships in the UN not continued from 1992 by any one successor state (see the sections Former members: Czechoslovakia and Former members: Yugoslavia).[8]\\r\\nAt the time of UN's founding, the seat of China in the UN was held by the Republic of China, but as a result of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971, it is now held by the People's Republic of China (see the section Former members: Republic of China (Taiwan)).\\r\\nA number of the original members were not sovereign when they joined the UN, and only gained full independence later:[9]\\r\\nThe current members and their dates of admission are listed below with their official designations used by the United Nations.[11][12]\\r\\nThe alphabetical order by the member states' official designations is used to determine the seating arrangement of the General Assembly sessions, where a draw is held each year to select a member state as the starting point.[13] Several members use their full official names in their official designations and thus are sorted out of order from their common names: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (a provisional reference used for all purposes within the UN, and listed under T), and the United Republic of Tanzania.\\r\\nThe member states can be sorted by their official designations and dates of admission by clicking on the buttons in the header of the columns. See related sections on former members by clicking on the links in the column See also.\\r\\nOriginal members are listed with blue background.\\r\\nThe Republic of China (ROC) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the United Nations Charter, Chapter V, Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[17] In 1949, as a result of the Chinese Civil War, the Kuomintang-led ROC government lost effective control of mainland China and relocated to the island of Taiwan, and the Communist Party-led government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), declared on 1 October 1949, took control of mainland China. The UN was notified on 18 November 1949 of the formation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China; however, the Government of the Republic of China continued to represent China at the UN, despite the small size of the ROC's jurisdiction of Taiwan and a number of smaller islands compared to the PRC's jurisdiction of mainland China. As both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate representative of China, proposals to effect a change in the representation of China in the UN were discussed but rejected for the next two decades, as the ROC was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members.[citation needed] Both sides rejected compromise proposals to allow both states to participate in the UN, based on the One-China policy.[18]\\r\\nBy the 1970s, a shift had occurred in international diplomatic circles and the PRC had gained the upper hand in international diplomatic relations and recognition count. On 25 October 1971, the 21st time the United Nations General Assembly debated on the PRC's admission into the UN,[19] United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 was adopted, by which it recognized that \\"the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of the Security Council,\\" and decided \\"to restore all its rights to the People's Republic of China and to recognize the representatives of its Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.\\"[20] This effectively transferred the seat of China in the UN, including its permanent seat on the Security Council, from the ROC to the PRC, and expelled the ROC from the UN. From the United Nations' perspective the \\"Republic of China\\" is not a former member. No UN member was expelled in 1971. Rather, the credentials of one Chinese delegation (from Taipei) were rejected and the credentials of another Chinese delegation (from Beijing) were accepted.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn addition to losing its seat in the UN, the UN Secretary-General concluded from the resolution that the General Assembly considered Taiwan to be a province of China. Consequently, the Secretary-General decided that it was not permitted for the ROC to become a party to treaties deposited with it.[21]\\r\\nIn 1993 the ROC began campaigning to rejoin the UN separately from the People's Republic of China. A number of options were considered, including seeking membership in the specialized agencies, applying for observer status, applying for full membership, or having resolution 2758 revoked to reclaim the seat of China in the UN.[22]\\r\\nEvery year from 1993ÿ2006, UN member states submitted a memorandum to the UN Secretary-General requesting that the UN General Assembly consider allowing the ROC to resume participating in the United Nations.[23] This approach was chosen, rather than a formal application for membership, because it could be enacted by the General Assembly, while a membership application would need Security Council approval, where the PRC held a veto.[22] Early proposals recommended admitting the ROC with parallel representation over China, along with the People's Republic of China, pending eventual reunification, citing examples of other divided countries which had become separate UN member states, such as East and West Germany and North and South Korea. Later proposals emphasized that the ROC was a separate state, over which the PRC had no effective sovereignty. These proposed resolutions referred to the ROC under a variety of names: \\"Republic of China in Taiwan\\" (1993ÿ94), \\"Republic of China on Taiwan\\" (1995ÿ97, 1999ÿ2002), \\"Republic of China\\" (1998), \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" (2003) and \\"Taiwan\\" (2004ÿ06).\\r\\nHowever, all fourteen attempts were unsuccessful as the General Assembly's General Committee declined to put the issue on the Assembly's agenda for debate, under strong opposition from the PRC.[24]\\r\\nWhile all these proposals were vague, requesting the ROC be allowed to participate in UN activities without specifying any legal mechanism, in 2007 the ROC submitted a formal application under the name \\"Taiwan\\" for full membership in the UN.[25] However, the application was rejected by the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs citing General Assembly Resolution 2758,[26] without being forwarded to the Security Council. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon stated that:\\r\\nThe position of the United Nations is that the People's Republic of China is representing the whole of China as the sole and legitimate representative Government of China. The decision until now about the wish of the people in Taiwan to join the United Nations has been decided on that basis. The resolution (General Assembly Resolution 2758) that you just mentioned is clearly mentioning that the Government of China is the sole and legitimate Government and the position of the United Nations is that Taiwan is part of China.[27]\\r\\nResponding to the UN's rejection of its application, the ROC government has stated that Taiwan is not now nor has it ever been under the jurisdiction of the PRC, and that since General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not clarify the issue of Taiwan's representation in the UN, it does not prevent Taiwan's participation in the UN as an independent sovereign nation.[28] The ROC government also criticized Ban for asserting that Taiwan is part of China and returning the application without passing it to the Security Council or the General Assembly,[29] contrary to UN's standard procedure (Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council, Chapter X, Rule 59).[30] On the other hand, the PRC government, which has stated that Taiwan is part of China and firmly opposes the application of any Taiwan authorities to join the UN either as a member or an observer, praised that UN's decision \\"was made in accordance with the UN Charter and Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly, and showed the UN and its member states' universal adherence to the one-China principle\\".[31] A group of UN member states put forward a draft resolution for that fall's UN General Assembly calling on the Security Council to consider the application.[25]\\r\\nThe following year two referendums in Taiwan on the government's attempts to regain participation at the UN did not pass due to low turnout. That fall the ROC took a new approach, with its allies submitting a resolution requesting that the \\"Republic of China (Taiwan)\\" be allowed to have \\"meaningful participation\\" in the UN specialized agencies.[32] Again the issue was not put on the Assembly's agenda.[24] In 2009, the ROC chose not to bring the issue of its participation in the UN up for debate at the General Assembly for the first time since it began the campaign in 1993.[33]\\r\\nIn May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by the World Health Organization to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name \\"Chinese Taipei\\". This was the ROC's first participation in an event organized by a UN-affiliated agency since 1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou became the President of the Republic of China a year before.[34]\\r\\nThe Republic of China is officially recognized by?17?UN member states and the Holy See. It maintains unofficial diplomatic relations with around 100 nations, including the United States and Japan.\\r\\nCzechoslovakia joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, with its name changed to the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on 20 April 1990. Upon the imminent dissolution of Czechoslovakia, in a letter dated 10 December 1992, its Permanent Representative informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic would cease to exist on 31 December 1992 and that the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as successor states, would apply for membership in the UN. Neither state sought sole successor state status. Both states were admitted to the UN on 19 January 1993.[35]\\r\\nBoth the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) were admitted to the UN on 18 September 1973. Through the accession of the East German federal states to the Federal Republic of Germany, effective from 3 October 1990, the territory of the German Democratic Republic became part of the Federal Republic of Germany, today simply known as Germany. Consequently, the Federal Republic of Germany continued being a member of the UN while the German Democratic Republic ceased to exist.[35]\\r\\nThe Federation of Malaya joined the United Nations on 17 September 1957. On 16 September 1963, its name was changed to Malaysia, following the formation of Malaysia from Singapore, North Borneo (now Sabah), Sarawak and the Federation of Malaya. Singapore became an independent State on 9 August 1965 and a Member of the United Nations on 21 September 1965.\\r\\nTanganyika was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1961, and Zanzibar was admitted to the UN on 16 December 1963. Following the ratification on 26 April 1964 of the Articles of Union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar, the two states merged to form the single member \\"United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar\\", with its name changed to the United Republic of Tanzania on 1 November 1964.[35][5]\\r\\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945, and as set out by the United Nations Charter, Chapter V, Article 23, became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[17] Upon the imminent dissolution of the USSR, in a letter dated 24 December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the President of the Russian Federation, informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of the USSR in the Security Council and all other UN organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the 11 member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States.[35]\\r\\nThe other fourteen independent states established from the former Soviet Republics were all admitted to the UN:\\r\\nBoth Egypt and Syria joined the UN as original members on 24 October 1945. Following a plebiscite on 21 February 1958, the United Arab Republic was established by a union of Egypt and Syria and continued as a single member. On 13 October 1961, Syria, having resumed its status as an independent state, resumed its separate membership in the UN. Egypt continued as a UN member under the name of the United Arab Republic, until it reverted to its original name on 2 September 1971. Syria changed its name to the Syrian Arab Republic on 14 September 1971.[35]\\r\\nYemen (i.e., North Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 30 September 1947; Southern Yemen (i.e., South Yemen) was admitted to the UN on 14 December 1967, with its name changed to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen on 30 November 1970, and was later referred to as Democratic Yemen. On 22 May 1990, the two states merged to form the Republic of Yemen, which continued as a single member under the name Yemen.[35]\\r\\nThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, referred to as Yugoslavia, joined the UN as an original member on 24 October 1945. By 1992, it had been effectively dissolved into five independent states, which were all subsequently admitted to the UN:\\r\\nDue to the dispute over its legal successor states, the member state \\"Yugoslavia\\", referring to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remained on the official roster of UN members for many years after its effective dissolution.[35] Following the admission of all five states as new UN members, \\"Yugoslavia\\" was removed from the official roster of UN members.\\r\\nThe government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, established on 28 April 1992 by the remaining Yugoslav republics of Montenegro and Serbia,[39] claimed itself as the legal successor state of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia;[40] however, on 30 May 1992, United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 was adopted, by which it imposed international sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia due to its role in the Yugoslav Wars, and noted that \\"the claim by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations has not been generally accepted,\\"[41] and on 22 September 1992, United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/47/1 was adopted, by which it considered that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cannot continue automatically the membership of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the United Nations,\\" and therefore decided that \\"the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should apply for membership in the United Nations and that it shall not participate in the work of the General Assembly\\".[42][43] The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia refused to comply with the resolution for many years, but following the ousting of President Slobodan Milo?evi? from office, it applied for membership, and was admitted to the UN on 1 November 2000.[38] On 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had its official name changed to Serbia and Montenegro, following the adoption and promulgation of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro by the Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.[44]\\r\\nOn the basis of a referendum held on 21 May 2006, Montenegro declared independence from Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2006. In a letter dated on the same day, the President of Serbia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that the membership of Serbia and Montenegro in the UN was being continued by Serbia, following Montenegro's declaration of independence, in accordance with the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro.[45] Montenegro was admitted to the UN on 28 June 2006.[46]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of the Kosovo War, the territory of Kosovo, then an autonomous province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was put under the interim administration of the United Nations Mission in Kosovo on 10 June 1999. On 17 February 2008 it declared independence, but this has not been recognised by Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo is not a member of the UN, but is a member of the International Monetary Fund[47] and the World Bank Group,[48] both specialized agencies in the United Nations System. The Republic of Kosovo is recognised by?113?UN member states, including three of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (France, the United Kingdom, and the United States), while the other twoChina and Russiado not recognise Kosovo. On 22 July 2010, the International Court of Justice, the primary judicial organ of the UN, issued an advisory opinion, ruling that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation of international law.[49]\\r\\nA member state may be suspended or expelled from the UN, according to the United Nations Charter. From Chapter II, Article 5:[3]\\r\\nA Member of the United Nations against which preventive or enforcement action has been taken by the Security Council may be suspended from the exercise of the rights and privileges of membership by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. The exercise of these rights and privileges may be restored by the Security Council.\\r\\nFrom Article 6:[3]\\r\\nA Member of the United Nations which has persistently violated the Principles contained in the present Charter may be expelled from the Organization by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.\\r\\nSince its inception, no member state has been suspended or expelled from the UN under Articles 5 and 6. However, in a few cases, states were suspended or expelled from participating in UN activities by means other than Articles 5 and 6:\\r\\nSince the inception of the UN, only one member state (excluding those that dissolved or merged with other member states) has unilaterally withdrawn from the UN. During the IndonesiaÿMalaysia confrontation, and in response to the election of Malaysia as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, in a letter dated 20 January 1965, Indonesia informed the United Nations Secretary-General that it had decided \\"at this stage and under the present circumstances\\" to withdraw from the UN. However, following the overthrow of President Sukarno, in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \\"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\\". On 28 September 1966, the United Nations General Assembly took note of the decision of the Government of Indonesia and the President invited the representatives of that country to take their seats in the Assembly.[35]\\r\\nUnlike suspension and expulsion, no express provision is made in the United Nations Charter of whether or how a member can legally withdraw from the UN (largely to prevent the threat of withdrawal from being used as a form of political blackmail, or to evade obligations under the Charter, similar to withdrawals that weakened the UN's predecessor, the League of Nations),[50] or on whether a request for readmission by a withdrawn member should be treated the same as an application for membership, i.e., requiring Security Council as well as General Assembly approval. Indonesia's return to the UN would suggest that this is not required; however, scholars have argued that the course of action taken by the General Assembly was not in accordance with the Charter from a legal point of view.[52]\\r\\nIn addition to the member states, there are two non-member permanent observer states: the Holy See and the State of Palestine.[53]\\r\\nThe Sovereign Military Order of Malta, while not a state, has observer status at the UN and maintains diplomatic relations with 107 countries.[65][66]\\r\\nA number of states were also granted observer status before being admitted to the UN as full members.[67][68][69] The most recent case of an observer state becoming a member state was Switzerland, which was admitted in 2002.[70]\\r\\nA European Union institution, the European Commission, was granted observer status at the UNGA through Resolution 3208 in 1974. The Treaty of Lisbon in 2009 resulted in the delegates being accredited directly to the EU.[71] It was accorded full rights in the General Assembly, bar the right to vote and put forward candidates, via UNGA Resolution A/RES/65/276 on 10 May 2011.[72] It is the only non-state party to over 50 multilateral conventions, and has participated as a full member in every way except for having a vote in a number of UN conferences.[73]\\r\\nThe sovereignty status of Western Sahara is in dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front. Most of the territory is controlled by Morocco, the remainder (the Free Zone) by the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, proclaimed by the Polisario Front. Western Sahara is listed by the UN as a \\"non-self-governing territory\\".[74]\\r\\nThe Cook Islands and Niue, which are both associated states of New Zealand, are not members of the UN, but are members of specialized agencies of the UN such as WHO[75] and UNESCO,[76] and have had their \\"full treaty-making capacity\\" recognized by United Nations Secretariat in 1992 and 1994 respectively.[77][78] They have since become parties to a number of international treaties which the UN Secretariat acts as a depositary for, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change[79] and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,[80] and are treated as non-member states.[81][77] Both the Cook Islands and Niue have expressed a desire to become a UN member state, but New Zealand has said that they would not support the application without a change in their constitutional relationship, in particular their right to New Zealand citizenship.[82][83]","input":"Which countries are non members of the un?"},{"output":"Turkey","context":"The Euphrates (/ju??fre?ti?z/?(?listen); Sumerian: ?????? Buranuna; Akkadian: ?????? Purattu; Arabic: ??????? al-Furt; Syriac: ????? P?rt; Armenian: ?????: Yeprat; Hebrew: ???? Perat; Turkish: F?rat; Kurdish: Firat?) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of Western Asia. Together with the Tigris, it is one of the two defining rivers of Mesopotamia (the \\"Land between the Rivers\\"). Originating in eastern Turkey, the Euphrates flows through Syria and Iraq to join the Tigris in the Shatt al-Arab, which empties into the Persian Gulf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ancient Greek form Euphrts (Ancient Greek: ???, as if from Greek ? \\"good\\" and ?? \\"I announce or declare\\") was adapted from Old Persian ???????????? Ufrtu,[1] itself from Elamite ?????????? ~-ip-ra-tu-i?. The Elamite name is ultimately derived from a name spelt in cuneiform as ?????? , which read as Sumerian language is \\"Buranuna\\"\\" and read as Akkadian language is \\"Purattu\\"; many cuneiform signs have a Sumerian pronunciation and an Akkadian pronunciation, taken from a Sumerian word and an Akkadian word that mean the same. In Akkadian the river was called Purattu,[2] which has been perpetuated in Semitic languages (cf. Syriac P(?)r?, Arabic al-Furrt) and in other nearby languages of the time (cf. Hurrian Puranti, Sabarian Uruttu). The Elamite, Akkadian, and possibly Sumerian forms are suggested to be from an unrecorded substrate language.[3] Gamkrelidze and Ivanov suggest the Proto-Sumerian *burudu \\"copper\\" (Sumerian urudu) as an origin, with an explanation that Euphrates was the river by which the copper ore was transported in rafts, since Mesopotamia was the center of copper metallurgy during the period.[4]\\r\\nThe earliest references to the Euphrates come from cuneiform texts found in Shuruppak and pre-Sargonic Nippur in southern Iraq and date to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. In these texts, written in Sumerian, the Euphrates is called Buranuna (logographic: UD.KIB.NUN). The name could also be written KIB.NUN.(NA) or dKIB.NUN, with the prefix \\"d\\" indicating that the river was a divinity. In Sumerian, the name of the city of Sippar in modern-day Iraq was also written UD.KIB.NUN, indicating a historically strong relationship between the city and the river.\\r\\nThe Euphrates is the longest river of Western Asia.[5] It emerges from the confluence of the Kara Su or Western Euphrates (450 kilometres (280?mi)) and the Murat Su or Eastern Euphrates (650 kilometres (400?mi)) 10 kilometres (6.2?mi) upstream from the town of Keban in southeastern Turkey.[6] Daoudy and Frenken put the length of the Euphrates from the source of the Murat River to the confluence with the Tigris at 3,000 kilometres (1,900?mi), of which 1,230 kilometres (760?mi) is in Turkey, 710 kilometres (440?mi) in Syria and 1,060 kilometres (660?mi) in Iraq.[7][8] The same figures are given by Isaev and Mikhailova.[9] The length of the Shatt al-Arab, which connects the Euphrates and the Tigris with the Persian Gulf, is given by various sources as 145ÿ195 kilometres (90ÿ121?mi).[10]\\r\\nBoth the Kara Su and the Murat Su rise northwest from Lake Van at elevations of 3,290 metres (10,790?ft) and 3,520 metres (11,550?ft) amsl, respectively.[11] At the location of the Keban Dam, the two rivers, now combined into the Euphrates, have dropped to an elevation of 693 metres (2,274?ft) amsl. From Keban to the SyrianÿTurkish border, the river drops another 368 metres (1,207?ft) over a distance of less than 600 kilometres (370?mi). Once the Euphrates enters the Upper Mesopotamian plains, its grade drops significantly; within Syria the river falls 163 metres (535?ft) while over the last stretch between Hؐt and the Shatt al-Arab the river drops only 55 metres (180?ft).[6][12]\\r\\nThe Euphrates receives most of its water in the form of rainfall and melting snow, resulting in peak volumes during the months April through May. Discharge in these two months accounts for 36 percent of the total annual discharge of the Euphrates, or even 60ÿ70 percent according to one source, while low runoff occurs in summer and autumn.[9][13] The average natural annual flow of the Euphrates has been determined from early- and mid-twentieth century records as 20.9 cubic kilometres (5.0?cu?mi) at Keban, 36.6 cubic kilometres (8.8?cu?mi) at Hؐt and 21.5 cubic kilometres (5.2?cu?mi) at Hindiya.[14] However, these averages mask the high inter-annual variability in discharge; at Birecik, just north of the SyroÿTurkish border, annual discharges have been measured that ranged from a low volume of 15.3 cubic kilometres (3.7?cu?mi) in 1961 to a high of 42.7 cubic kilometres (10.2?cu?mi) in 1963.[15]\\r\\nThe discharge regime of the Euphrates has changed dramatically since the construction of the first dams in the 1970s. Data on Euphrates discharge collected after 1990 show the impact of the construction of the numerous dams in the Euphrates and of the increased withdrawal of water for irrigation. Average discharge at Hؐt after 1990 has dropped to 356 cubic metres (12,600?cu?ft) per second (11.2 cubic kilometres (2.7?cu?mi) per year). The seasonal variability has equally changed. The pre-1990 peak volume recorded at Hؐt was 7,510 cubic metres (265,000?cu?ft) per second, while after 1990 it is only 2,514 cubic metres (88,800?cu?ft) per second. The minimum volume at Hؐt remained relatively unchanged, rising from 55 cubic metres (1,900?cu?ft) per second before 1990 to 58 cubic metres (2,000?cu?ft) per second afterward.[16][17]\\r\\nIn Syria, three rivers add their water to the Euphrates; the Sajur, the Balikh and the Khabur. These rivers rise in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains along the SyroÿTurkish border and add comparatively little water to the Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near Gaziantep and draining the plain around Manbij before emptying into the reservoir of the Tishrin Dam. The Balikh receives most of its water from a karstic spring near 'Ayn al-'Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of Raqqa. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around Ra's al-'Ayn, from where the Khabur flows southeast past Al-Hasakah, where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near Busayrah. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.[18][19]\\r\\nThe drainage basins of the Kara Su and the Murat River cover an area of 22,000 square kilometres (8,500?sq?mi) and 40,000 square kilometres (15,000?sq?mi), respectively.[6] The estimates that have been made for the area of the Euphrates drainage basin vary widely; from a low 233,000 square kilometres (90,000?sq?mi) to a high 766,000 square kilometres (296,000?sq?mi).[9] Recent estimates put the basin area at 388,000 square kilometres (150,000?sq?mi),[6] 444,000 square kilometres (171,000?sq?mi)[7][20] and 579,314 square kilometres (223,674?sq?mi).[21] The greater part of the Euphrates basin is located in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. According to both Daoudy and Frenken, Turkey's share is 28 percent, Syria's is 17 percent and that of Iraq is 40 percent.[7][8] Isaev and Mikhailova estimate the percentages of the drainage basin lying within Turkey, Syria and Iraq at 33, 20 and 47 percent respectively.[9] Some sources estimate that approximately 15 percent of the drainage basin is located within Saudi Arabia, while a small part falls inside the borders of Kuwait.[7][8] Finally, some sources also include Jordan in the drainage basin of the Euphrates; a small part of the eastern desert (220 square kilometres (85?sq?mi)) drains toward the east rather than to the west.[9][22]\\r\\nThe Euphrates flows through a number of distinct vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation in most parts of the Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye.[23] South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the SyroÿIraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants.[24] Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.[25]\\r\\nAmong the fish species in the TigrisÿEuphrates basin, the family of the Cyprinidae are the most common, with 34 species out of 52 in total.[26] Among the Cyprinids, the mangar has good sport fishing qualities, leading the British to nickname it \\"Tigris salmon.\\" The Rafetus euphraticus is an endangered soft-shelled turtle that is limited to the TigrisÿEuphrates river system.[27][28]\\r\\nThe Neo-Assyrian palace reliefs from the 1st millennium BCE depict lion and bull hunts in fertile landscapes.[29] Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on an abundance of animals living in the area, many of which have become rare or even extinct. Species like gazelle, onager and the now-extinct Arabian ostrich lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley, while the valley itself was home to the wild boar. Carnivorous species include the gray wolf, the golden jackal, the red fox, the leopard and the lion. The Syrian brown bear can be found in the mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of European beaver has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of Abu Hureyra in Syria, but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.[30]\\r\\nThe Hindiya Barrage on the Iraqi Euphrates, based on plans by British civil engineer William Willcocks and finished in 1913, was the first modern water diversion structure built in the TigrisÿEuphrates river system.[31] The Hindiya Barrage was followed in the 1950s by the Ramadi Barrage and the nearby Abu Dibbis Regulator, which serve to regulate the flow regime of the Euphrates and to discharge excess flood water into the depression that is now Lake Habbaniyah. Iraq's largest dam on the Euphrates is the Haditha Dam; a 9-kilometre-long (5.6?mi) earth-fill dam creating Lake Qadisiyah.[32] Syria and Turkey built their first dams in the Euphrates in the 1970s. The Tabqa Dam in Syria was completed in 1973 while Turkey finished the Keban Dam, a prelude to the immense Southeastern Anatolia Project, in 1974. Since then, Syria has built two more dams in the Euphrates, the Baath Dam and the Tishrin Dam, and plans to build a fourth dam ÿ the Halabiye Dam ÿ between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor.[33] The Tabqa Dam is Syria's largest dam and its reservoir (Lake Assad) is an important source of irrigation and drinking water. It was planned that 640,000 hectares (2,500?sq?mi) should be irrigated from Lake Assad, but in 2000 only 100,000ÿ124,000 hectares (390ÿ480?sq?mi) had been realized.[34][35] Syria also built three smaller dams on the Khabur and its tributaries.[36]\\r\\nWith the implementation of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (Turkish: Gneydo?u Anadolu Projesi, or GAP) in the 1970s, Turkey launched an ambitious plan to harness the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates for irrigation and hydroelectricity production and provide an economic stimulus to its southeastern provinces.[37] GAP affects a total area of 75,000 square kilometres (29,000?sq?mi) and approximately 7 million people; representing about 10 percent of Turkey's total surface area and population, respectively. When completed, GAP will consist of 22 dams ÿ including the Keban Dam ÿ and 19 power plants and provide irrigation water to 1,700,000 hectares (6,600?sq?mi) of agricultural land, which is about 20 percent of the irrigable land in Turkey.[38] C. 910,000 hectares (3,500?sq?mi) of this irrigated land is located in the Euphrates basin.[39] By far the largest dam in GAP is the Atatrk Dam, located c. 55 kilometres (34?mi) northwest of ?anl?urfa. This 184-metre-high (604?ft) and 1,820-metre-long (5,970?ft) dam was completed in 1992; thereby creating a reservoir that is the third-largest lake in Turkey. With a maximum capacity of 48.7 cubic kilometres (11.7?cu?mi), the Atatrk Dam reservoir is large enough to hold the entire annual discharge of the Euphrates.[40] Completion of GAP was scheduled for 2010 but has been delayed because the World Bank has withheld funding due to the lack of an official agreement on water sharing between Turkey and the downstream states on the Euphrates and the Tigris.[41]\\r\\nApart from barrages and dams, Iraq has also created an intricate network of canals connecting the Euphrates with Lake Habbaniyah, Lake Tharthar, and Abu Dibbis reservoir; all of which can be used to store excess floodwater. Via the Shatt al-Hayy, the Euphrates is connected with the Tigris. The largest canal in this network is the Main Outfall Drain or so-called \\"Third River;\\" constructed between 1953 and 1992. This 565-kilometre-long (351?mi) canal is intended to drain the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris south of Baghdad to prevent soil salinization from irrigation. It also allows large freight barges to navigate up to Baghdad.[42][43][44]\\r\\nThe construction of the dams and irrigation schemes on the Euphrates has had a significant impact on the environment and society of each riparian country. The dams constructed as part of GAP ÿ in both the Euphrates and the Tigris basins ÿ have affected 382 villages and almost 200,000 people have been resettled elsewhere. The largest number of people was displaced by the building of the Atatrk Dam, which alone affected 55,300 people.[45] A survey among those who were displaced showed that the majority were unhappy with their new situation and that the compensation they had received was considered insufficient.[46] The flooding of Lake Assad led to the forced displacement of c. 4,000 families, who were resettled in other parts of northern Syria as part of a now abandoned plan to create an \\"Arab belt\\" along the borders with Turkey and Iraq.[47][48][49]\\r\\nApart from the changes in the discharge regime of the river, the numerous dams and irrigation projects have also had other effects on the environment. The creation of reservoirs with large surfaces in countries with high average temperatures has led to increased evaporation; thereby reducing the total amount of water that is available for human use. Annual evaporation from reservoirs has been estimated at 2 cubic kilometres (0.48?cu?mi) in Turkey, 1 cubic kilometre (0.24?cu?mi) in Syria and 5 cubic kilometres (1.2?cu?mi) in Iraq.[50] Water quality in the Iraqi Euphrates is low because irrigation water tapped in Turkey and Syria flows back into the river, together with dissolved fertilizer chemicals used on the fields.[51] The salinity of Euphrates water in Iraq has increased as a result of upstream dam construction, leading to lower suitability as drinking water.[52] The many dams and irrigation schemes, and the associated large-scale water abstraction, have also had a detrimental effect on the ecologically already fragile Mesopotamian Marshes and on freshwater fish habitats in Iraq.[53][54]\\r\\nThe inundation of large parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance.[55] Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press.[56][57] The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet, Emar and Abu Hureyra.[58] A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important Pre-Pottery Neolithic B site of Jerf el-Ahmar.[59] An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq.[60] Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also providing opportunities for looting, which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq in the wake of the 2003 invasion.[61]\\r\\nThe early occupation of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches; that is, the area that is popularly known as the Fertile Crescent. Acheulean stone artifacts have been found in the Sajur basin and in the El Kowm oasis in the central Syrian steppe; the latter together with remains of Homo erectus that were dated to 450,000 years old.[62][63] In the Taurus Mountains and the upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley, early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra ÿ at first occupied by hunter-gatherers but later by some of the earliest farmers, Jerf el-Ahmar, Mureybet and Neval? ?ori became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward.[64] In the absence of irrigation, these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible, that is, the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey.[65] Late Neolithic villages, characterized by the introduction of pottery in the early 7th millennium BCE, are known throughout this area.[66] Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 6th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation, as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period, including Tell es-Sawwan.[67] During the 5th millennium BCE, or late Ubaid period, northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages, although some of them grew to a size of over 10 hectares (25 acres).[68] In Iraq, sites like Eridu and Ur were already occupied during the Ubaid period.[69] Clay boat models found at Tell Mashnaqa along the Khabur indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period.[70] The Uruk period, roughly coinciding with the 4th millennium BCE, saw the emergence of truly urban settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like Tell Brak and Uruk grew to over 100 hectares (250 acres) in size and displayed monumental architecture.[71] The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery, architecture and sealings far into Turkey and Iran has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. Habuba Kabira on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.[72][73]\\r\\nDuring the Jemdet Nasr (3600ÿ3100 BCE) and Early Dynastic periods (3100ÿ2350 BCE), southern Mesopotamia experienced a growth in the number and size of settlements, suggesting strong population growth. These settlements, including Sumero-Akkadian sites like Sippar, Uruk, Adab and Kish, were organized in competing city-states.[74] Many of these cities were located along canals of the Euphrates and the Tigris that have since dried up, but that can still be identified from remote sensing imagery.[75] A similar development took place in Upper Mesopotamia, Subartu and Assyria, although only from the mid 3rd millennium and on a smaller scale than in Lower Mesopotamia. Sites like Ebla, Mari and Tell Leilan grew to prominence for the first time during this period.[76]\\r\\nLarge parts of the Euphrates basin were for the first time united under a single ruler during the Akkadian Empire (2335ÿ2154 BC) and Ur III empires, which controlled ÿ either directly or indirectly through vassals ÿ large parts of modern-day Iraq and northeastern Syria.[77] Following their collapse, the Old Assyrian Empire (1975ÿ1750 BCE) and Mari asserted their power over northeast Syria and northern Mesopotamia, while southern Mesopotamia was controlled by city-states like Isin, Kish and Larsa before their territories were absorbed by the newly emerged state of Babylonia under Hammurabi in the early to mid 18th century BCE.[78]\\r\\nIn the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE, the Euphrates basin was divided between Kassite Babylon in the south and Mitanni, Assyria and the Hittite Empire in the north, with the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365ÿ1020 BC) eventually eclipsing the Hittites, Mitanni and Kassite Babylonians.[79] Following the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the late 11th century BCE, struggles broke out between Babylonia and Assyria over the control of the Iraqi Euphrates basin. The Neo-Assyrian Empire (935ÿ605 BC) eventually emerged victorious out of this conflict and also succeeded in gaining control of the northern Euphrates basin in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE.[80]\\r\\nIn the centuries to come, control of the wider Euphrates basin shifted from the Neo-Assyrian Empire (which collapsed between 612 and 599 BC) to the short lived Median Empire (612ÿ546 BC) and equally brief Neo-Babylonian Empire (612ÿ539 BC) in the last years of the 7th century BC, and eventually to the Achaemenid Empire (539ÿ333 BC).[81] The Achaemenid Empire was in turn overrun by Alexander the Great, who defeated the last king Darius III and died in Babylon in 323 BCE.[82]\\r\\nSubsequent to this, the region came under the control of the Seleucid Empire (312ÿ150 BC), Parthian Empire (150ÿ226 AD) (during which several Neo-Assyrian states such as Adiabene came to rule certain regions of the Euphrates), and was fought over by the Roman Empire, its succeeding Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire (226ÿ638 AD), until the Islamic conquest of the mid 7th century AD.\\r\\nAfter World War I, the borders in Southwest Asia were redrawn in the Treaty of Lausanne, when the Ottoman Empire was partitioned. Clause 109 of the treaty stipulated that the three riparian states of the Euphrates (at that time Turkey, France for its Syrian mandate and the United Kingdom for its mandate of Iraq) had to reach a mutual agreement on the use of its water and on the construction of any hydraulic installation.[83] An agreement between Turkey and Iraq signed in 1946 required Turkey to report to Iraq on any hydraulic changes it made on the TigrisÿEuphrates river system, and allowed Iraq to construct dams on Turkish territory to manage the flow of the Euphrates.[84]\\r\\nThe river featured on the coat of arms of Iraq from 1932-1959.\\r\\nTurkey and Syria completed their first dams on the Euphrates ÿ the Keban Dam and the Tabqa Dam, respectively ÿ within one year of each other and filling of the reservoirs commenced in 1975. At the same time, the area was hit by severe drought and river flow toward Iraq was reduced from 15.3 cubic kilometres (3.7?cu?mi) in 1973 to 9.4 cubic kilometres (2.3?cu?mi) in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union.[85][86] A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkey's hydroelectricity production.[87] In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least 500 cubic metres (18,000?cu?ft) per second, or 16 cubic kilometres (3.8?cu?mi) per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries.[88] Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey.[84][86][89] In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee (JTC) on the management of the water in the TigrisÿEuphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.[90] On April 15, 2014, Turkey began to reduce the flow of the Euphrates into Syria and Iraq. The flow was cut off completely on May 16, 2014resulting in the Euphrates terminating at the TurkishÿSyrian border.[91] This was in violation of an agreement reached in 1987 in which Turkey committed to releasing a minimum of 500 cubic metres (18,000?cu?ft) of water per second at the TurkishÿSyrian border.[92]\\r\\nThroughout history, the Euphrates has been of vital importance to those living along its course. With the construction of large hydropower stations, irrigation schemes, and pipelines capable of transporting water over large distances, many more people now depend on the river for basic amenities such as electricity and drinking water than in the past. Syria's Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water for the city of Aleppo, 75 kilometres (47?mi) to the west of the river valley.[93] The lake also supports a modest state-operated fishing industry.[94] Through a newly restored power line, the Haditha Dam in Iraq provides electricity to Baghdad.[95]","input":"What countries does the euphrates river flow through?"},{"output":"Richmond","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\n$150,000,000 (1992 Southern stand redevelopment)\\r\\n\\r\\nMelbourne Football Club (1858ÿpresent)  Richmond Football Club (1965ÿpresent) Collingwood Football Club (1993ÿpresent)  Hawthorn Football Club (2000ÿpresent)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), also known simply as \\"The G\\",[4] is an Australian sports stadium located in Yarra Park, Melbourne, Victoria. Home to the Melbourne Cricket Club, it is the 10th-largest stadium in the world, the largest in Australia, the largest in the Southern Hemisphere, the largest cricket ground by capacity, and has the tallest light towers of any sporting venue. The MCG is within walking distance of the city centre and is served by the Richmond railway station, Richmond, and the Jolimont railway station, East Melbourne. It is part of the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince it was built in 1853, the MCG has been in a state of almost constant renewal. It served as the centrepiece stadium of the 1956 Summer Olympics, the 2006 Commonwealth Games and two Cricket World Cups: 1992 and 2015. It is also famous for its role in the development of international cricket; it was the venue for both the first Test match and the first One Day International, played between Australia and England in 1877 and 1971 respectively. The annual Boxing Day Test is one of the MCG's most popular events. Referred to as \\"the spiritual home of Australian rules football\\" for its strong association with the sport since it was codified in 1859, it hosts Australian Football League (AFL) matches in the winter, with at least one game held there in most (if not all) rounds of the home-and-away season. The stadium fills to capacity for the AFL Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nHome to the National Sports Museum, the MCG has hosted other major sporting events, including international rules football matches between Australia and Ireland, international rugby union matches, State of Origin (rugby league) games, and FIFA World Cup qualifiers. Concerts and other cultural events are also held at the venue, with the record attendance standing at around 130,000 for a Billy Graham evangelistic crusade in 1959. Grandstand redevelopments and occupational health and safety legislation have limited the maximum seating capacity to approximately 95,000 with an additional 5,000 standing room capacity, bringing the total capacity to 100,024.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register[5] and was included on the Australian National Heritage List in 2005.[6] Journalist Greg Baum called it \\"a shrine, a citadel, a landmark, a totem\\" that \\"symbolises Melbourne to the world\\".[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in November 1838 the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) selected the current MCG site in 1853 after previously playing at several grounds around Melbourne. The clubs first game was against a military team at the Old Mint site, at the corner of William and Latrobe Streets. Burial Hill (now Flagstaff Gardens) became its home ground in January 1839, but the area was already set aside for Botanical Gardens and the club was moved on in October 1846, to an area on the south bank of the Yarra about where the Herald and Weekly Times building is today. The area was subject to flooding, forcing the club to move again, this time to a ground in South Melbourne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long before the club was forced out again, this time because of the expansion of the railway. The South Melbourne ground was in the path of Victorias first steam railway line from Melbourne to Sandridge (now Port Melbourne). Governor La Trobe offered the MCC a choice of three sites; an area adjacent to the existing ground, a site at the junction of Flinders and Spring Streets or a ten-acre (about 4?hectares) section of the Government Paddock at Richmond next to Richmond Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last option, which is now Yarra Park, had been used by Aborigines until 1835. Between 1835 and the early 1860s it was known as the Government or Police Paddock and served as a large agistment area for the horses of the Mounted Police, Border Police and Native Police.  The north-eastern section also housed the main barracks for the Mounted Police in the Port Phillip district. In 1850 it was part of a 200-acre (81?ha) stretch set aside for public recreation extending from Governor La Trobes Jolimont Estate to the Yarra River. By 1853 it had become a busy promenade for Melbourne residents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn MCC sub-committee chose the Richmond Park option because it was level enough for cricket but sloped enough to prevent inundation. That ground was located where the Richmond, or outer, end of the current MCG is now.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time the Richmond Cricket Club was given occupancy rights to six acres (2.4?hectares) for another cricket ground on the eastern side of the Government Paddock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of the land grant the Government stipulated that the ground was to be used for cricket and cricket only. This condition remained until 1933[citation needed][8] when the State Government allowed the MCGs uses to be broadened to include other purposes when not being used for cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1863 a corridor of land running diagonally across Yarra Park was granted to the Hobsons Bay Railway and divided Yarra Park from the river. The Mounted Police barracks were operational until the 1880s when it was subdivided into the current residential precinct bordered by Vale Street. The area closest to the river was also developed for sporting purposes in later years including Olympic venues in 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first grandstand at the MCG was the original wooden members stand built in 1854, while the first public grandstand was a 200-metre long 6000-seat temporary structure built in 1861. Another grandstand seating 2000, facing one way to the cricket ground and the other way to the park where football was played, was built in 1876 for the 1877 visit of James Lillywhite's English cricket team. It was during this tour that the MCG hosted the world's first Test match.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1881 the original members' stand was sold to the Richmond Cricket Club for S55. A new brick stand, considered at the time to be the worlds finest cricket facility, was built in its place. The foundation stone was laid by Prince George of Wales and Prince Albert Victor on 4 July and the stand opened in December that year. It was also in 1881 that a telephone was installed at the ground, and the wickets and goal posts were changed from an east-west orientation to north-south. In 1882 a scoreboard was built which showed details of the batsman's name and how he was dismissed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the Lillywhite tour stand burnt down in 1884 it was replaced by a new stand which seated 450 members and 4500 public. In 1897, second-storey wings were added to The Grandstand, as it was known, increasing capacity to 9,000. In 1900 it was lit with electric light.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore stands were built in the early 20th century. An open wooden stand was on the south side of the ground in 1904 and the 2084-seat Grey Smith Stand (known as the New Stand until 1912) was erected for members in 1906. The 4000-seat Harrison Stand on the grounds southern side was built in 1908 followed by the 8000-seat Wardill Stand in 1912. In the 15 years after 1897 the stand capacity at the ground increased to nearly 20,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1927 the second brick members stand was replaced at a cost of S60,000. The Harrison and Wardill Stands were demolished in 1936 to make way for the Southern Stand which was completed in 1937. The Southern Stand seated 18,200 under cover and 13,000 in the open and was the main public area of the MCG. The maximum capacity of the ground under this configuration, as advised by the Health Department, was 84,000 seated and 94,000 standing.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Northern Stand, also known as the Olympic Stand, was built to replace the old Grandstand for the 1956 Olympic Games. By Health Department regulations, this was to increase the stadium's capacity to 120,000; although this was revised down after the 1956 VFL Grand Final, which could not comfortably accommodate its crowd of 115,802.[10] Ten years later, the Grey Smith Stand and the open concrete stand next to it were replaced by the Western Stand; the Duke of Edinburgh laid a foundation stone for the Western Stand on 3 March 1967, and it was completed in 1968; in 1986, it was renamed the Ponsford Stand in honour of Victorian batsman Bill Ponsford. This was the stadium's highest capacity configuration, and the all-time record crowd for a sporting event at the venue of 121,696 was set under this configuration in the 1970 VFL Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG was the home of Australias first full colour video scoreboard, which replaced the old scoreboard in 1982, located on Level 4 of the Western Stand. A second video screen added in 1994 almost directly opposite, on Level 4 of the Olympic stand. In 1985, light towers were installed at the ground, allowing for night football and day-night cricket games.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1988 inspections of the old Southern Stand found concrete cancer and provided the opportunity to replace the increasingly run-down 50-year-old facility. The projected cost of $100?million was outside what the Melbourne Cricket Club could afford so the Victorian Football League took the opportunity to part fund the project in return for a 30-year deal to share the ground. The new Great Southern Stand was completed in 1992, in time for the 1992 Cricket World Cup, at a final cost of $150?million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1928 Members' stand, the 1956 Olympic stand and the 1968 Ponsford stand were demolished one by one between late 2003 to 2005 and replaced with a new structure in time for the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[11] Despite now standing as a single unbroken stand, the individual sections retain the names of Ponsford, Olympic and Members Stands. The redevelopment cost exceeded A$400?million and pushed the ground's capacity to just above 100,000. Since redevelopment, the highest attendance was the 2018 Grand Final of the AFL with 100,022, followed by 100,021 in the 2017 Grand Final.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2011 until 2013, the Victorian Government and the Melbourne Cricket Club funded a $55?million refurbishment of the facilities of Great Southern Stand, including renovations to entrance gates and ticket outlets, food and beverage outlets, etc., without significantly modifying the stand.[12] New scoreboards, more than twice the size of the original ones, were installed in the same positions in late 2013.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first cricket match at the venue was played on 30 September 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first inter-colonial cricket match to be played at the MCG was between Victoria and New South Wales in March 1856. Victoria had played Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's Land) as early as 1851 but the Victorians had included two professionals in the 1853 team upsetting the Tasmanians and causing a cooling of relations between the two colonies. To replace the disgruntled Tasmanians the Melbourne Cricket Club issued a challenge to play any team in the colonies for S1000. Sydney publican William Tunks accepted the challenge on behalf of New South Wales although the Victorians were criticised for playing for money. Ethics aside, New South Wales could not afford the S1000 and only managed to travel to Melbourne after half the teams travel cost of S181 was put up by Sydney barrister Richard Driver.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game eventually got under way on 26 March 1856. The Victorians, stung by criticism over the S1000 stake, argued over just about everything; the toss, who should bat first, whether different pitches should be used for the different innings and even what the umpires should wear.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictoria won the toss but New South Wales captain George Gilbert successfully argued that the visiting team should decide who bats first. The MCG was a grassless desert and Gilbert, considering players fielded without boots, promptly sent Victoria into bat. Needing only 16 to win in the final innings, New South Wales collapsed to be 5 for 5 before Gilberts batting saved the game and the visitors won by three wickets.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn subsequent years conditions at the MCG improved but the ever-ambitious Melburnians were always on the lookout for more than the usual diet of club and inter-colonial games. In 1861, Felix William Spiers and Christopher Pond, the proprietors of the Cafe de Paris in Bourke Street and caterers to the MCC, sent their agent, W.B. Mallam, to England to arrange for a cricket team to visit Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMallam found a team and, captained by Heathfield Stephenson, it arrived in Australia on Christmas Eve 1861 to be met by a crowd of more than 3000 people. The team was taken on a parade through the streets wearing white-trimmed hats with blue ribbons given to them for the occasion. Wherever they went they were mobbed and cheered by crowds to the point where the tour sponsors had to take them out of Melbourne so that they could train undisturbed.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir first game was at the MCG on New Years Day 1862, against a Victorian XVIII. The Englishmen also wore coloured sashes around their waists to identify each player and were presented with hats to shade them from the sun. Some estimates put the crowd at the MCG that day at 25,000. It must have been quite a picture with a new 6000 seat grandstand, coloured marquees ringing the ground and a carnival outside. Stephenson said that the ground was better than any in England. The Victorians however, were no match for the English at cricket and the visitors won by an innings and 96 runs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the four days of the test more than 45,000 people attended and the profits for Speirs and Pond from this game alone was enough to fund the whole tour. At that time it was the largest number of people to ever watch a cricket match anywhere in the world. Local cricket authorities went out of their way to cater for the needs of the team and the sponsors. They provided grounds and sponsors booths without charge and let the sponsors keep the gate takings. The sponsors however, were not so generous in return. They quibbled with the Melbourne Cricket Club about paying S175 for damages to the MCG despite a prior arrangement to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last match of the tour was against a Victorian XXII at the MCG after which the English team planted an elm tree outside the ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the success of this tour, a number of other English teams also visited in subsequent years. George Parrs side came out in 1863ÿ64 and there were two tours by sides led by W.G. Grace. The fourth tour was led by James Lillywhite.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Boxing Day 1866 an Indigenous Australian cricket team played at the MCG with 11,000 spectators against an MCC team. A few players in that match were in a later team that toured England in 1868. Some also played in three other matches at the ground before 1869.\\r\\n\\r\\nUp until the fourth tour in 1877, led by Lillywhite, touring teams had played first-class games against the individual colonial sides, but Lillywhite felt that his side had done well enough against New South Wales to warrant a game against an All Australian team.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Lillywhite headed off to New Zealand he left Melbourne cricketer John Conway to arrange the match for their return. Conway ignored the cricket associations in each colony and selected his own Australian team, negotiating directly with the players. Not only was the team he selected of doubtful representation but it was also probably not the strongest available as some players had declined to take part for various reasons. Demon bowler Fred Spofforth refused to play because wicket-keeper Billy Murdoch was not selected. Paceman Frank Allan was at Warnambool Agricultural Show and Australias best all-rounder Edwin Evans could not get away from work. In the end only five Australian-born players were selected.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same could be said for Lillywhites team which, being selected from only four counties, meant that some of Englands best players did not take part. In addition, the team had a rough voyage back across the Tasman Sea and many members had been seasick. The game was due to be played on 15 March, the day after their arrival, but most had not yet fully recovered. On top of that, wicket-keeper Ted Pooley was still in a New Zealand prison after a brawl in a Christchurch pub.\\r\\n\\r\\nEngland was nonetheless favourite to win the game and the first ever Test match began with a crowd of only 1000 watching. The Australians elected Dave Gregory from New South Wales as Australias first ever captain and on winning the toss he decided to bat.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Bannerman scored an unbeaten 165 before retiring hurt. Sydney Cricket Ground curator, Ned Gregory, playing in his one and only Test for Australia, scored Test crickets first duck. Australia racked up 245 and 104 while England scored 196 and 108 giving Australia victory by 45 runs. The win hinged on Bannermans century and a superb bowling performance by Tom Kendall who took 7 for 55 in Englands second innings.\\r\\n\\r\\nA fortnight later there was a return game, although it was really more of a benefit for the English team. Australia included Spofforth, Murdoch and T.J.D. Cooper in the side but this time the honours went to England who won by four wickets.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years later Lord Harris brought another England team out and during Englands first innings in the Test at the MCG, Fred Spofforth took the first hat-trick in Test cricket. He bagged two hauls of 6 for 48 and 7 for 62 in Australias ten wicket win.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough most of the 20th century, the Melbourne Cricket Ground was one of the two major Test venues in Australia (along with the Sydney Cricket Ground), and it would host one or two Tests in each summer in which Tests were played; since 1982, the Melbourne Cricket Ground has hosted one Test match each summer. Until 1979, the ground almost always hosted its match or one of its matches over the New Year, with the first day's play falling somewhere between 29 December and 1 January; in most years since 1980 and every year since 1995, its test has begun on Boxing Day, and it is now a standard fixture in the Australian cricket calendar and is known as the Boxing Day Test.[15] The venue also hosts one-day international matches each year, and Twenty20 international matches most years. No other venue in Melbourne has hosted a Test, and Docklands Stadium is the only other venue to have hosted a limited-overs international.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Victorian first-class team plays Sheffield Shield cricket at the venue during the season. Prior to Test cricket being played on Boxing Day, it was a long-standing tradition for Victoria to host New South Wales in a first-class match on Boxing Day. Victoria also played its limited overs matches at the ground.[16] Since the introduction of the domestic Twenty20 Big Bash League (BBL) in 2011, the Melbourne Stars club has played its home matches at the ground. It is also the home ground of the Melbourne Stars Women team, which plays in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL).[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the 1980s, the integral MCG pitch ÿ grown from Merri Creek black soil ÿ was considered the worst in Australia, in some matches exhibiting wildly inconsistent bounce which could see balls pass through as grubbers or rear dangerously high ÿ a phenomenon which was put down to damage caused by footballers in winter and increased use for cricket during the summers of the 1970s.[18] The integral pitch has since been removed and drop-in pitches have been used since 1996, generally offering consistent bounce and a fair balance between bat and ball.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe highest first class team score in history was posted at the MCG in the Boxing Day match against New South Wales in 1926ÿ27. Victoria scored 1107 in two days, with Bill Ponsford scoring 352 and Jack Ryder scoring 295.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most sensational incidents in Test cricket occurred at the MCG during the Melbourne test of the 1954ÿ55 England tour of Australia. Big cracks had appeared in the pitch during a very hot Saturdays play and on the rest day Sunday, groundsman Jack House watered the pitch to close them up. This was illegal and the story was leaked by The Age newspaper. The teams agreed to finish the match and England won by 128 runs after Frank Tyson took 7 for 27 in the final innings.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn incident in the second Test of the 1960ÿ61 series involved the West Indies player Joe Solomon being given out after his hat fell on the stumps after being bowled at by Richie Benaud. The crowd sided with the West Indies over the Australians.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only was the first Test match played at the MCG, the first One Day International match was also played there, on 5 January 1971, between Australia and England. The match was played on what was originally scheduled to have been the fifth day of a Test match, but the Test was abandoned after the first three days were washed out.[20] Australia won the 40-over match by 5 wickets. The next ODI was played on August 1972, some 19 months later.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1977, the Australian Cricket Board assembled 218 of the surviving 224 Australia-England players for a Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket between the two nations. The match was the idea of former Australian bowler and MCC committee member Hans Ebeling who had been responsible for developing the cricket museum at the MCG. The match had everything. Englands Derek Randall scored 174, Australias Rod Marsh also got a century, Lillee took 11 wickets, and David Hookes, in his first test, smacked five fours in a row off England captain Tony Greigs bowling. Rick McCosker who opened for Australia suffered a fractured jaw after being hit by a sharply rising delivery. He left the field but came back in the second innings with his head swathed in bandages. Australia won the match by 45 runs, exactly the same margin as the first Test in 1877.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother incident occurred on 1 February 1981 at the end of a one-day match between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand, batting second, needed six runs off the last ball of the day to tie the game. Australian captain, Greg Chappell instructed his brother Trevor, who was bowling the last over, to send the last ball down underarm to prevent the New Zealand batsman, Brian McKechnie, from hitting the ball for six. Although not entirely in the spirit of the game, an underarm delivery was quite legal, so long as the arm was kept straight. The Laws of cricket have since been changed to prevent such a thing happening again. The incident has long been a sore point between Australia and New Zealand.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February and March 1985 the Benson & Hedges World Championship of Cricket was played at the MCG, a One Day International tournament involving all of the then Test match playing countries to celebrate 150 years of the Australian state of Victoria. Some matches were also played at Sydney Cricket Ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG hosted the 1992 Cricket World Cup Final between Pakistan and England with a crowd of more than 87,000. Pakistan won the match after an all-round performance by Wasim Akram who scored 33 runs and picked up 3 crucial wickets to make Pakistan cricket world champions for the first and as yet only time.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the 1995 Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Australian umpire Darrell Hair called Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing the ball, rather than bowling it, seven times during the match.[citation needed] The other umpires did not call him once and this caused a controversy, although he was later called for throwing by other umpires seven other times in different matches.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG is known for its great atmosphere,[citation needed] much of which is generated in the infamous Bay 13, situated almost directly opposite to the members stand. In the late 1980s, the crowd at Bay 13 would often mimic the warm up stretches performed by Merv Hughes. In a 1999 One-Day International, the behaviour of Bay 13 was so bad that Shane Warne, donning a helmet for protection, had to enter the ground from his dressing rooms and tell the crowd to settle down at the request of opposing England captain Alec Stewart.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG hosted three pool games as part of the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup as well as a quarter-final, and then the final on 29 March. Australia comfortably defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in front of an Australian record cricket crowd of 93,013.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017-18 Ashes series, Alastair Cook scored the highest score by an English batsman and second double century since Wally Hammond at the ground. Steve Smith scored his 4th consecutive century at the ground (2014-2017) in reply, being the only player since Don Bradman (1928ÿ31) to do so. Smith also lasted 1093 days, or scored 455 runs, between two wickets fallen.[23] The match ended in a draw, dashing hopes of Australia achieving the third Ashes sweep in the 21st Century. The wicket used for the Boxing Day test was the first Australian wicket ever to be rated 'poor' by the ICC[24].\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite being called the Melbourne Cricket Ground, the stadium has been and continues to be used much more often for Australian rules football. Spectator numbers for football are larger than for any other sport in Australia, and it makes more money for the MCG than any of the other sports played there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the Melbourne Cricket Club members were instrumental in founding Australian Rules Football, there were understandable concerns in the early days about the damage that might be done to the playing surface if football was allowed to be played at the MCG. Therefore, football games were often played in the parklands next to the cricket ground, and this was the case for the first documented football match to be played at the ground. The match which today is considered to be the first Australian rules football, played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar over three Saturdays beginning 7 August 1858 was played in this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt wasnt until 1869 that football was played on the MCG proper, a trial game involving a police team. It was not for another ten years, in 1879, after the formation of the Victorian Football Association, that the first official match was played on the MCG and the cricket ground itself became a regular venue for football. Two night matches were played on the ground during the year under the newly invented electric light.[25][26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early years, the MCG was the home ground of Melbourne Football Club, Australias oldest club, established in 1858 by the founder of the game itself, Thomas Wills. Melbourne won five premierships during the 1870s using the MCG as its home ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first of nearly 3000 Victorian Football League/Australian Football League games to be played at the MCG was on 15 May 1897, with Melbourne beating Geelong 64 to 19.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Australian Football League (AFL) clubs later joined Melbourne in using the MCG as their home ground for matches: Richmond (1965), North Melbourne (1985), Essendon (1992), Collingwood (started moving in 1994, became a full-time tenant in 2000) and Hawthorn (2000). Melbourne used the venue as its training base until 1984, before being required to move to preserve the venue's surface when North Melbourne began playing there.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe VFL/AFL Grand Final has been played at the MCG every season since 1902, except in 1924 when no Grand Final was held because of the season's round-robin finals format (it hosted three of the six games in the Finals Series) 1942ÿ1945, when the ground was used by the military during World War II; and in 1991, as the construction of the Great Southern Stand had temporarily reduced the grounds capacity below that of Waverley Park. All three Grand Final Replays have been played at the MCG.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the ground was fully seated, the Grand Final could draw attendances above 110,000. The record for the highest attendance in the history of the sport was set in the 1970 VFL Grand Final, with 121,696 in attendance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince being fully seated, Grand Final attendances are typically between 95,000 and 100,000, with the record of 100,022 in the 2018 grand final, followed by 100,016 attending the first 2010 AFL Grand Final (which ended in a draw, requiring a replay).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the modern era, most finals games held in Melbourne have been played at the MCG. Under the current contract, ten finals (excluding the Grand Final) must be played at the MCG over a five-year period. Under previous contracts, the MCG was entitled to host at least one match in each week of the finals, which on several occasions required non-Victorian clubs to play \\"home\\" finals in Victoria. On 12 April 2018, the AFL, Victorian Government and Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) announced that the MCG would continue to host the Grand Final until at least 2057.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Melbourne based teams (and most of the time Geelong) play their 'home' finals at the MCG unless if 4 Victorian teams win the right to host a final in the first week of the finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor many years the VFL had an uneasy relationship with the MCG trustees and the Melbourne Cricket Club. Both needed the other, but resented the dependence. The VFL made the first move which brought things to a head by beginning the development of VFL Park at Mulgrave in the 1960s as its own home ground and as a potential venue for future grand finals. Then in 1983, president of the VFL, Allen Aylett started to pressure the MCG Trust to give the VFL a greater share of the money it made from using the ground for football.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn March 1983 the MCG trustees met to consider a submission from Aylett. Aylett said he wanted the Melbourne Cricket Clubs share of revenue cut from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. He threatened to take the following days opening game of the season, Collingwood vs Melbourne, away from the MCG. The money was held aside until an agreement could be reached.\\r\\n\\r\\nDifferent deals, half deals and possible deals were done over the years, with the Premier of Victoria, John Cain, Jr., even becoming involved. Cain was said to have promised the VFL it could use the MCG for six months of the year and then hand it back to the MCC, but this never eventuated, as the MCG Trust did not approve it. In the mid-1980s, a deal was done where the VFL was given its own members area in the Southern Stand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgainst this background of political manoeuvring, in 1985 North Melbourne became the third club to make the MCG its home ground. In the same year, North played in the first night football match at the MCG for almost 110 years, against Collingwood on 29 March 1985.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986, only a month after Ross Oakley had taken over as VFL Commissioner, VFL executives met with the MCC and took a big step towards resolving their differences. Changes in the personnel at the MCC also helped. In 1983 John Lill was appointed secretary and Don Cordner its president.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the Southern Stand opened in 1992, the Australian Football League moved its headquarters into the complex. The AFL assisted with financing the new stand and came to an agreement that ensures at least 45 AFL games are played at the MCG each year, including the Grand Final in September. Another 45 days of cricket are also played there each year and more than 3.5?million spectators come to watch every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of the end of 2011, Matthew Richardson holds the records for having scored the most goals on the MCG, and Kevin Bartlett holds the record for playing the most matches at the MCG. Two players have scored 14 goals for an AFL or VFL game in one match at the MCG: Gary Ablett, Sr. in 1989 and 1993, and John Longmire in 1990.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore an AFL match between Richmond and Carlton on 27 August 1999, the city end scoreboard caught on fire due to an electrical fault, causing the start of play to be delayed by half an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, the government requisitioned the MCG for military use. From 1942 until 1945 it was occupied by (in order): the United States Army Air Forces, the Royal Australian Air Force, the United States Marine Corps and again the RAAF.[29] Over the course of the war, more than 200,000 personnel were barracked at the MCG. From April to October 1942, the US Armys Fifth Air Force occupied the ground, naming it \\"Camp Murphy\\", in honor of officer Colonel William Murphy, a senior USAAF officer killed in Java. In 1943 the MCG was home to the legendary First Regiment of the First Division of the United States Marine Corps. The First Marine Division were the heroes of the Guadalcanal campaign and used the \\"cricket grounds\\", as the marines referred to it, to rest and recuperate.[29] On 14 March 1943 the marines hosted a giant \\"get together\\" of American and Australian troops on the arena.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, Melbourne Cricket Club president Sir Albert Chadwick and Medal of Honor recipient, Colonel Mitchell Paige, unveiled a commemorative plaque recognizing the Americans' time at the ground.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn episode 3 of the 2010 TV miniseries, The Pacific, members of the US Marines are shown to be camped in the war-era MCG.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCGs most famous moment in history was as the main stadium for the 1956 Olympic Games.[30] The MCG was only one of seven possible venues, including the Melbourne Showgrounds, for the Games main arena. The MCG was the Federal Governments preferred venue but there was resistance from the MCC. The inability to decide on the central venue nearly caused the Games to be moved from Melbourne. Prime Minister Robert Menzies recognised the potential embarrassment to Australia if this happened and organised a three-day summit meeting to thrash things out. Attending was Victorian Premier John Cain, Sr., the Prime Minister, deputy opposition leader Arthur Calwell, all State political leaders, civic leaders, Olympic officials and trustees and officials of the MCC. Convening the meeting was no small effort considering the calibre of those attending and that many of the sports officials were only part-time amateurs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs 22 November, the date of the opening ceremony, drew closer, Melbourne was gripped ever more tightly by Olympic fever. At 3?pm the day before the opening ceremony, people began to line up outside the MCG gates. That night the city was paralysed by a quarter of a million people who had come to celebrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG's capacity was increased by the new Olympic (or Northern) Stand, and on the day itself 103,000 people filled the stadium to capacity. A young up and coming distance runner was chosen to carry the Olympic torch into the stadium for the opening ceremony.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Ron Clarke had a number of junior world records for distances of 1500?m, one mile (1.6?km) and two miles (3?km), he was relatively unknown in 1956. Perhaps the opportunity to carry the torch inspired him because he went on to have a career of exceptional brilliance and was without doubt the most outstanding runner of his day. At one stage he held the world record for every distance from two miles (3?km) to 20?km. His few failures came in Olympic and Commonwealth Games competition. Although favourite for the gold at Tokyo in 1964 he was placed ninth in the 5,000?metres race and the marathon and third in the 10,000?metres. He lost again in the 1966 Commonwealth Games and in 1968 at altitude in Mexico he collapsed at the end of the 10?km race.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn that famous day in Melbourne in 1956 the torch spluttered and sparked, showering Clarke with hot magnesium, burning holes in his shirt. When he dipped the torch into the cauldron it burst into flame singeing him further. In the centre of the ground, John Landy, the fastest miler in the world, took the Olympic oath and sculler Merv Wood carried the Australian flag.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Melbourne Games also saw the high point of Australian female sprinting with Betty Cuthbert winning three gold medals at the MCG. She won the 100?m and 200?m and anchored the winning 4 x 100?m team. Born in Merrylands in Sydneys west she was a champion schoolgirl athlete and had already broken the world record for the 200?m just before the 1956 Games. She was to be overshadowed by her Western Suburbs club member, the Marlene Matthews. When they got to the Games, Matthews was the overwhelming favourite especially for the 100?m a distance over which Cuthbert had beaten her just once.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Matthews and Cuthbert won their heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5?seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that record in the following heat with a time of 11.4?seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50?metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled out a little extra to win Australias first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5?seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200?m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jacksons Olympic record. Mathews was third again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time the 1956 Olympics came around, Shirley Strickland was a mother of 31 years of age but managed to defend her 80?m title, which she had won in Helsinki four years before, winning gold and setting a new Olympic record.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sensational incident of the track events was the non-selection of Marlene Matthews in the 4 x 100?m relay. Matthews trained with the relay team up until the selection was made but Cuthbert, Strickland, Fleur Mellor and Norma Croker were picked for the team. There was outrage at the selection which increased when Matthews went on to run third in both the 100?m and 200?m finals. Personally she was devastated and felt that she had been overlooked for her poor baton change. Strickland was disappointed with the way Matthews was treated and maintained it was an opinion held in New South Wales that she had baton problems. One of the selectors, Doris Magee from NSW, said that selecting Matthews increased the risk of disqualification at the change. But Cuthbert maintained that the selectors made the right choice saying that Fleur Mellor was fresh, a specialist relay runner and was better around the curves than Matthews.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe men did not fare so well. The 4 x 400?m relay team, including later IOC Committee member Kevan Gosper, won silver. Charles Porter also won silver in the high jump. Hec Hogan won bronze in the 100?m to become the first Australian man to win a medal in a sprint since the turn of the century and despite injury John Landy won bronze in the 1500?m. Allan Lawrence won bronze in the 10,000?m event.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from athletics, the stadium was also used for the soccer finals, the hockey finals, the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and an exhibition game of baseball between the Australian National Team and a US armed services team at which an estimated crowd of 114,000 attended. This was the Guinness World Record for the largest attendance for any baseball game, which stood until a 29 March 2008 exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers at the Los Angeles Coliseum (also a former Olympic venue in 1932 and 1984) drawing 115,300.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCG was also used for another demonstration sport, Australian Rules. The Olympics being an amateur competition meant that only amateurs could play in the demonstration game. A combined team of amateurs from the VFL and VFA were selected to play a state team from the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA). The game was played 7 December 1956 with the VAFA side, wearing white jumpers, green collars and the Olympic rings on their chests, winning easily 81 to 55. One of the players chosen for the VFA side was Lindsay Gaze (although he never got off the bench) who would go on to make his mark in another sport, basketball, rather than Australian Rules.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MCGs link with its Olympic past continues to this day. Within its walls is the IOC-endorsed Australian Gallery of Sport and Olympic Museum.\\r\\n\\r\\nForty-four years later at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, the ground hosted several soccer preliminaries, making it one of a few venues ever used for more than one Olympics.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the 2006 Commonwealth Games were held at the MCG, as well as athletics events during the games. The games began on 15 March and ended on 26 March.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seating capacity of the stadium during the games was 80,000. A total of 47 events were contested, of which 24 by male and 23 by female athletes. Furthermore, three men's and three women's disability events were held within the programme. All athletics events took place within the Melbourne Cricket Ground, while the marathon and racewalking events took place on the streets of Melbourne and finished at the main stadium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hosts Australia easily won the medals table with 16 golds and 41 medals in total. Jamaica came second with 10 golds and 22 medals, while Kenya and England were the next best performers. A total of eleven Games records were broken over the course of the seven-day competition. Six of the records were broken by Australian athletes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first game of Rugby Union to be played on the ground was on Saturday, 29 June 1878, when the Waratah Club of Sydney played Carlton Football Club in a return of the previous years contests in Sydney where the clubs had competed in both codes of football. The match, watched by a crowd of between 6,000 and 7,000 resulted in a draw; one goal and one try being awarded to each team.[32][33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next Rugby match was held on Wednesday 29 June 1881, when the Wanderers, a team organised under the auspices of the Melbourne Cricket Club, played a team representing a detached Royal Navy squadron then visiting Melbourne. The squadron team won by one goal and one try to nil.\\r\\n[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until 19 August 1899 that the MCG was again the venue for a Union match, this time Victoria v the British Lions (as they were later to be called). During the preceding week the Victorians had held several trial and practice matches there, as well as several training sessions, despite which they were defeated\\r\\n30ÿ0 on the day before a crowd of some 7,000.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nNine years later, on Monday, 10 August 1908, Victoria was again the host, this time to the Australian team en route to Great Britain and soon to be dubbed the First Wallabies. Despite being held on a working day some 1,500 spectators attended to see the visitors win by 26ÿ6.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, 6 July 1912 the MCG was the venue, for the only time ever, of a match between two Victorian Rugby Union clubs, Melbourne and East Melbourne, the former winning 9ÿ5 in what was reported to be ... one of the finest exhibitions of the Rugby game ever seen in Victoria. It was played before a large crowd as a curtain raiser to a State Rules match against South Australia.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday 18 June 1921, in another curtain raiser, this time to a Melbourne-Fitzroy League game, a team representing Victoria was soundly beaten 51ÿ0 by the South African Springboks in front of a crowd of 11,214.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nine years later, on Saturday 13 September 1930, that the British Lions returned to play Victoria, again before a crowd of 7,000, this time defeating the home side 41ÿ36, a surprisingly narrow winning margin. \\r\\n[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first post war match at the MCG was on 21 May 1949 when the NZ Maoris outclassed a Southern States side 35ÿ8 before a crowd of close to 10,000.[40] A year later, on 29 July 1950, for the first and only time, Queensland travelled to Victoria to play an interstate match, defeating their hosts 31ÿ12 before a crowd of 7,479.[41] \\r\\nIn the following year the MCG was the venue for a contest between the New Zealand All Blacks and an Australian XV . This was on 30 June 1951 before some 9,000 spectators and resulted in a convincing 56ÿ11 win for the visitors.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion did not return the MCG until the late 1990s, for several night time Test matches, both Australia v New Zealand All Blacks as part of the Tri Nations Series. The first, on Saturday 26 July 1997, being notable for an attendance of 90,119, the visitors winning 33ÿ18 and the second, on Saturday 11 July 1998, for a decisive victory to Australia of 24ÿ16. Australia and New Zealand met again at the MCG during the 2007 Tri Nations Series on 30 June, the hosts again winning, this time by 20 points to 15 in front of a crowd of 79,322.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nRugby league was first played at the ground on 15 August 1914, with the New South Wales team losing to England 15ÿ21.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first ever State of Origin match at the MCG (and second in Melbourne) was Game II of the 1994 series, and the attendance of 87,161 set a new record rugby league crowd in Australia. The MCG was also the venue for Game II of the 1995 State of Origin series and drew 52,994, the most of any game that series. The second game of the 1997 State of Origin series, which, due to the Super League war only featured Australian Rugby League-signed players, was played there too, but only attracted 25,105, the lowest in a series that failed to attract over 35,000 to any game.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Melbourne Storm played two marquee games at the MCG in 2000. This was the first time that they had played outside of their normal home ground of Olympic Park Stadium which held 18,500 people. Their first game was held on 3 March 2000 against the St. George Illawarra Dragons in a rematch of the infamous 1999 NRL Grand Final. Dragons player Anthony Mundine said the Storm were 'not worthy premiers' and they responded by running in 12 tries to two, winning 70ÿ10 in front of 23,239 fans. This was their biggest crowd they had played against until 33,427 turned up to the 2007 Preliminary Final at Docklands Stadium which saw Melbourne defeat the Parramatta Eels 26ÿ10. The record home and away crowd record has also been overhauled, when a match at Docklands in 2010 against St George attracted 25,480 spectators. Their second game attracted only 15,535 spectators and was up against the Cronulla Sharks on 24 June 2000. Once again, the Storm won 22ÿ16.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was announced in June 2014 that the ground would host its first State of Origin match since 1997.[45] Game II of the 2015 series was played at the venue, with an all-time record State of Origin crowd of 91,513 attending the match.[46] The attendance is 19th on the all time rugby league attendance list and the 4th highest rugby league attendance in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 9 February 2006 Victorian premier Steve Bracks and Football Federation Australia chairman Frank Lowy announced that the MCG would host a world class soccer event each year from 2006 until 2009 inclusive.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe agreement sees an annual fixture at the MCG, beginning with a clash between Australia and European champions Greece on 25 May 2006 in front of a sell-out crowd of 95,103, before Australia left to contest in the World Cup finals.

The Socceroos also hosted a match in 2007 against Argentina, losing 1ÿ0, as well as 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches in 2009 against Japan, which attracted 81,872 fans as Australia beat Japan 2ÿ1 via 2 Tim Cahill headers after falling behind 1ÿ0 late in the 1st half.

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans or animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as computer servers, power amplifiers, and even to display and store artwork.\\r\\nAir conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a car to improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The cooling is typically achieved through a refrigeration cycle, but sometimes evaporation or free cooling is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on desiccants (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling. [2]\\r\\nIn the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, cooling, (de-)humidification, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, \\"air conditioning\\" refers to systems which cool air. In construction, a complete system of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning is referred to as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC ÿ as opposed to AC).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling. The business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late 17th century.[4] This practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines.\\r\\nThe basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In Ancient Rome, water from aqueducts was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval Persia involved the use of cisterns and wind towers to cool buildings during the hot season.[5]\\r\\nThe 2nd-century Chinese mechanical engineer and inventor Ding Huan of the Han Dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3?m (10?ft) in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time.[6] In 747, Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712ÿ762) of the Tang Dynasty (618ÿ907) had the Cool Hall (Liang Tian) built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent Song Dynasty (960ÿ1279), written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.[7]\\r\\nIn the 17th century, the Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel demonstrated \\"Turning Summer into Winter\\" as an early form of modern air conditioning for James I of England by adding salt to water.[8]\\r\\nModern air conditioning emerged from advances in chemistry during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by American inventor Willis Carrier. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the Sun Belt in the United States.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1758, Benjamin Franklin and John Hadley, a chemistry professor at Cambridge University, conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the evaporation. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to ?14?C (7?F) while the ambient temperature was 18?C (64?F). Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water 0?C (32?F), a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about 6?mm (1?4?in) thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching ?14?C (7?F). Franklin concluded: \\"From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day.\\"[9]\\r\\nIn 1820, English scientist and inventor Michael Faraday discovered that compressing and liquefying ammonia could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, Florida physician John Gorrie used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in Apalachicola, Florida. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the \\"Ice King\\", Frederic Tudor, for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a smear campaign against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.[citation needed]\\r\\nJames Harrison's first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong (Australia). His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether vapor compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced 3,000 kilograms of ice per day.[citation needed]\\r\\nThough Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice refrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. He wrote: \\"Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period\\", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was invented by Willis Carrier in Buffalo, New York. After graduating from Cornell University, Carrier found a job at the Buffalo Forge Company. While there, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in Brooklyn, New York. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.[citation needed]\\r\\nDesigned to improve manufacturing process control in a printing plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only temperature but also humidity. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and automobiles as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1906, Stuart W. Cramer of Charlotte was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term \\"air conditioning\\", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to \\"water conditioning\\", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to \\"condition\\" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.[10]\\r\\nShortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by Charles Gates.[11] Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, David St. Pierre DuBose (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home Meadowmont, all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.[when?] This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for central air conditioning.[12]\\r\\nIn 1945, Robert Sherman of Lynn, Massachusetts invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.[13]\\r\\nThe first air conditioners and refrigerators employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon, in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).\\r\\nDichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the US until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the US for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including R-410A. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name Puron.[citation needed]\\r\\nModern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include HCFCs (R-22, as used in most U.S. homes even before 2011) and HFCs (R-134a, used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the Montreal Protocol and replaced by HFCs such as R-410A, which lack chlorine.[14] HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems. Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.[15][16] Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed. The environmental organization Greenpeace solicited a European laboratory to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992, gained patent rights to a hydrocarbon mix of isopentane and isobutane, but then left the technology as open access.[17][18] Their activist marketing first in Germany led to companies like Whirlpool, Bosch, and later LG and others to incorporate the technology throughout Europe, then Asia, although the corporate executives resisted in Latin America, so that it arrived in Argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003, and then finally with giant Bosch's production in Brazil by 2004.[19][20]\\r\\nIn 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators illegal.[21] DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. E.P.A., disparaging the approach as \\"that German technology.\\"[20][22] Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!.[21][23] Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take steps to support production and use in the U.S.[24] Only in 2011 did the E.P.A. finally decide in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture.[17][25][26]\\r\\nIn the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A refrigerator is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The refrigerant is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently ejects that heat elsewhere.\\r\\nCirculating refrigerant vapor enters the compressor, where its pressure and temperature are increased. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.\\r\\nThe condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an expansion valve (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. Aircraft air conditioners use turbines for cooling, more efficient but more complex. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own \\"kind\\" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).\\r\\nModern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc. A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing thermistor may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a defrost cycle may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.\\r\\nBy running an air conditioner's compressor in the opposite direction, the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor compartment will become heated instead of cooled (see heat pump). The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gasÿvapor mixtures is called psychrometrics.\\r\\nA heat pump is an air conditioner in which the refrigeration cycle can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as a \\"reverse cycle air conditioner\\". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).\\r\\nAir-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 40ÿ55?F (4ÿ13?C), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.\\r\\nThe icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as a natural gas or oil furnace, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.\\r\\nAbsorption heat pumps are a kind of air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on electricity to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome more expensive fixed window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater.\\r\\nIn very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.[27] These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.\\r\\nAir conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.\\r\\nFree cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are mature technology.[28]\\r\\nSince humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the evaporation of perspiration from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50% to 60% relative humidity in the occupied space.[citation needed]\\r\\nRefrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the dewpoint) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. Therefore, water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered. The water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors. The heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled.\\r\\nOn most modern air-conditioning systems there is a dehumidification cycle; the compressor is on and the fan is slowed as much as possible (lowest speed under normal conditions).[citation needed] This reduces the evaporator temperature and therefore condenses more water than if it were to have a high fan speed. To help mitigate temperature drops when the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor turn off,[clarification needed] this stops moisture on the evaporator being blown back into the room.[citation needed] When the temperature rises[clarification needed] again the compressor comes and the fan goes back to low speed. However occasionally the fan will stay on and compressor go off to thaw any ice produced (hence why the program doesn't work in cool conditions).\\r\\nInverter type air Conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor (typically used for heat pump operation where it regulates fan speed according to how warm the evaporator is) to adjust compressor speed to keep the evaporator as cold as possible, when the evaporator is too cold[clarification needed] the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.\\r\\nA specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier. It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.\\r\\nIn addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the latent heat of vaporization). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an evaporative cooler, and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.\\r\\nInside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.\\r\\nDehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent mold growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in tropical countries.\\r\\nIn a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.[29] To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its \\"efficiency\\" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100?W heating element is activated, and the air conditioner has an coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50?W to compensate for this, thus making the 100?W heating element cost a total of 150?W of power.\\r\\nIt is typical for air conditioners to operate at \\"efficiencies\\" of significantly greater than 100%.[30] However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower entropy) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).\\r\\nAir conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of \\"tons of refrigeration\\". A ton of refrigeration is approximately equal to the cooling power of one short ton (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 BTU per hour, or 3517 watts.[31] Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3 to 20 kilowatts (kW)) in capacity.\\r\\nFor residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in watt hours (W{h) during the same period.[32]\\r\\nthis can also be rewritten as:\\r\\nFor example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.\\r\\nThe electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:\\r\\nAssuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).\\r\\nAnother method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:\\r\\nThen, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:\\r\\nSEER is related to the coefficient of performance (COP) commonly used in thermodynamics and also to the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an Imperial unit divided by an SI unit. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy (joules) in both the numerator and denominator. They cancel out, leaving a dimensionless quantity. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.[33]\\r\\nFrom equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy.\\r\\nThe United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10).\\r\\nWindow unit air conditioners are installed in an open window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.\\r\\nIn 1971, General Electric introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.[34]\\r\\nPackaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.[35] They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.\\r\\nThe first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at Chrysler Motors and offered for sale starting in 1935.[36]\\r\\nSplit-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) heat exchanger is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.\\r\\nA mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.[37] Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce 9,000?to 36,000?Btu (9,500ÿ38,000?kJ) per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's.\\r\\nAdvantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.[38]\\r\\nThe primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity.\\"[39]\\r\\nAn additional possible disadvantage that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems, although lower operating costs and rebates or other financial incentivesoffered in some areascan help offset the initial expense.[40]\\r\\nCentral (ducted) air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling, and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes.\\r\\nIn central air conditioning, the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace/AC unit of the forced air heating system which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building.\\r\\nMulti-split system[41] -?is a conventional?split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator?and condenser) and allows cooling or?heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of?freon?supplied to the indoor units located in the room.\\r\\nDifference between split system and multi-split system:\\r\\nOther common types of?air conditioning?system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.\\r\\nIts unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building.The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.?\\r\\nMulti-split system Installation:\\r\\nBefore selecting the installation location of?air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered.[42] First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.\\r\\nThe main problem when installing a multi-split system?is the laying of long freon lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.\\r\\nThe selection of indoor units has one restriction - their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, its very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. But, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.\\r\\nA portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about 5,000ÿ60,000?BTU/h (1,500ÿ18,000?W) and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.\\r\\nThe compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.\\r\\nA portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit.\\r\\nHose systems, which can be monoblock or air-to-air, are vented to the outside via air ducts. The monoblock type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The air-to-air type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.\\r\\nA single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.[43]\\r\\nModern units might have a coefficient of performance of approximately 3 (i.e., 1?kW of electricity will produce 3?kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers, sometimes called \\"swamp coolers\\", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the latent heat of vaporisation, cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating.\\r\\nEvaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.\\r\\nAir-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into comfort and process applications.\\r\\nComfort applications aim to provide a building indoor environment that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.\\r\\nAir conditioning makes deep plan buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with light wells so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via natural ventilation. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since wind speed increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings.[citation needed] Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as:\\r\\nWomen have, on average, a significantly lower resting metabolic rate than men.[46] Using inaccurate metabolic rate guidelines for air conditioning sizing can result in oversized and less efficient equipment,[46] and setting system operating setpoints too cold can result in reduced worker productivity.[47]\\r\\nIn addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.\\r\\nAir conditioning is common in the US, with 88% of new single-family homes constructed in 2011 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the South to 62% in the West.[48] In Canada, air conditioning use varies by province. In 2013, 55% of Canadian households reported having an air conditioner, with high use in Manitoba (80%), Ontario (78%), Saskatchewan (67%), and Quebec (54%) and lower use in Prince Edward Island (23%), British Columbia (21%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (9%).[49] In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common. Southern European countries such as Greece have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years.[50] In another southern European country, Malta, it is estimated that around 55% of households have an air conditioner installed.[51] In India AC sales have dropped by 40% [clarification needed] due to higher costs and stricter energy efficiency regulations.[52]\\r\\nProcess applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions. It is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include these:\\r\\nIn both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only control temperature, but also humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to space.\\r\\nAir-conditioning systems can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms,[53] such as Legionella pneumophila, the infectious agent responsible for Legionnaires' disease, or thermophilic actinomycetes; however, this is only prevalent in poorly maintained water cooling towers. As long as the cooling tower is kept clean (usually by means of a chlorine treatment), these health hazards can be avoided or reduced.\\r\\nConversely, air conditioning (including filtration, humidification, cooling and disinfection) can be used to provide a clean, safe, hypoallergenic atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being. Excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin, causing it to dry out, and can also cause dehydration.[citation needed]\\r\\nInnovation in air conditioning technologies continues, with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency. Production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gases.\\r\\nCylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems.[54] On a semi-hermetic (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. Unloaders can be electrical or mechanical.\\r\\nIn the United States, 87 percent of the homes use air conditioning and 65 percent of those homes having central air conditioning. Most of the homes with central air conditioning have programmable thermostats, but approximately two-thirds of the homes with central air do not use the features of them to make their homes more energy efficient.[55]\\r\\nIn an automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 horsepower (3?kW) of the engine's power, thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle.[56]\\r\\nMost refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming, and many also deplete the ozone layer.[57] CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are potent greenhouse gases when leaked to the atmosphere.\\r\\nThe use of CFC as a refrigerant was once common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under the brand name Freon-12). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the upper atmosphere.[58] Once the refrigerant reaches the stratosphere, UV radiation from the Sun homolytically cleaves the chlorine-carbon bond, yielding a chlorine radical. These chlorine radicals catalyze the breakdown of ozone into diatomic oxygen, depleting the ozone layer that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable molecule and quenching the chain reaction.\\r\\nPrior to 1994, most automotive air conditioning systems used R-12 as a refrigerant. It was replaced with R-134a refrigerant, which has no ozone depletion potential. Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.\\r\\nR22 (also known as HCFC-22) has a global warming potential about 1,800 times higher than CO2.[59] It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere.\\r\\nIn the UK, the Ozone Regulations[60] came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a \\"top-up\\" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.[61]\\r\\nThe manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also Montreal Protocol).[62][63] In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.[64]\\r\\nAs an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO2 (R-744), have been proposed.[65] R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. It is an effective refrigerant with a global warming potential of 1, but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1992, a non-governmental organization, Greenpeace, was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants. This led to two alternatives, one a blend of propane (R290) and isobutane (R600a), and one of pure isobutane.[18][21] Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993, and in the U.S. until 2011, despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 (see Refrigerant Development above).[26][66]","input":"When did a/c first appear in homes?"},{"output":"Aruna Asaf Ali","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nAruna Asaf Ali (16 July 1909 ÿ 29 July 1996), born Aruna Ganguly, was an Indian independence activist. She is widely remembered for hoisting the Indian National Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank maidan in Bombay during the Quit India Movement, 1942.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Independence, she remained active in politics, becoming Delhi's first mayor in 1958. In the 1960s, she successfully started a media publishing house.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe received India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1997.\\r\\n\\r\\nAruna Asaf Ali was born (Aruna Ganguly) on 16 July 1909 in Kalka, Punjab, British India (now in Haryana, India) into a Bengali Brahmo family. Her father Upendranath Ganguly hailed from Barisal district of Eastern Bengal (now Bangladesh) but settled in the United Province. He was a restaurant owner. Her mother Ambalika Devi was the daughter of Trailokyanath Sanyal, a renowned Brahmo leader who wrote many Brahmo hymns. Upendranath Ganguly's younger brother Dhirendranath Ganguly (D G) was one of the earliest film directors.[1] Another brother, Nagendranath, was a university professor who married Nobel Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore's only surviving daughter Mira Devi.[2] Aruna's sister Purnima Banerjee was a member of the Constituent Assembly of India.\\r\\n\\r\\nAruna was educated at Sacred Heart Convent in Lahore and then at All Saints' College in Nainital. After her graduation, she worked as a teacher at the Gokhale Memorial School in Calcutta. She met Asaf Ali, a leader in the Congress party, in Allahabad. They got married in 1928, despite parental opposition on grounds of religion and age (he was a Muslim and her senior by more than 20 years).[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMy father was no more when Asaf and I married in September 1928. My paternal uncle Nagendranath Ganguly, a university professor who regarded himself as my guardian, said to relatives and friends that as far as he was concerned I was dead and he had performed my shraddh.[4]\\r\\nShe was  an active member of Congress Party after marrying Asaf Ali and participated in public processions during the Salt Satyagraha.  She was arrested on the charge that she was a vagrant and hence not released in 1931 under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact which stipulated release of all political prisoners. Other women co-prisoners refused to leave the premises unless she was also released and gave in only after Mohandas K. Gandhi intervened. A public agitation secured her release.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1932, she was held prisoner at the Tihar Jail where she protested the indifferent treatment of political prisoners by launching a hunger strike. Her efforts resulted in an improvement of conditions in the Tihar Jail but she was moved to Ambala and was subjected to solitary confinement. She was politically not very active after her release, but at the ending of 1942, she took part in the underground movement. She was active in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 8 August 1942, the All India Congress Committee passed the Quit India resolution at the Bombay session. The government responded by arresting the major leaders and all members of the Congress Working Committee and thus tried to pre-empt the movement from success. Young Aruna Asaf Ali presided over the remainder of the session on  9 August and hoisted the Congress flag at the Gowalia Tank Maidan. This marked the commencement of the movement. The police fired upon the assembly at the session. Aruna was dubbed the Heroine of the 1942 movement for her bravery in the face of danger and was called Grand Old Lady of the Independence movement in her later years. Despite the absence of direct leadership, spontaneous protests and demonstrations were held all over the country, as an expression of the desire of Indias youth to achieve independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn arrest warrant was issued in her name but she went underground to evade the arrest and started an underground movement in the year 1942. Her property was seized and sold. In the meanwhile, she also edited Inquilab, a monthly magazine of the Congress Party, along with Ram Manohar Lohia. In a 1944 issue, she exhorted youth to action by asking them to forget futile discussions about violence and non-violence and join the revolution. Leaders such as Jayaprakash Narayan and Aruna Asaf Ali were described as \\"the Political children of Gandhi but recent students of Karl Marx.\\" The government announced a reward of 5,000 rupees for her capture. She fell ill and was for a period hiding in Dr. Joshi's Hospital in Karol Bagh in Delhi. Mahatma Gandhi sent her a hand-written note to her to come out of hiding and surrender herself ÿ as her mission was accomplished and as she could utilize the reward amount for the Harijan cause. However, she came out of hiding only after the warrant against her was withdrawn in 1946. She treasured the note from the Mahatma and it adorned her drawing room. However, she also faced criticism from Gandhi for her support of the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny, a movement she saw as the single greatest unifying factor of Hindus and Muslims at a time that was the peak of the movement for Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was a member of the Congress Socialist Party, a caucus within the Congress Party for activists with socialist leanings. Disillusioned with the progress of the Congress Party on socialism she joined a new party, Socialist Party in 1948. She, however, left that party along with Edatata Narayanan and they visited Moscow along with Rajani Palme Dutt. Both of them joined the Communist Party of India in the early 1950s. On the personal front, she was bereaved when Asaf Ali died in 1953.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1954, she helped form the National Federation of Indian Women, the women's wing of CPI but left the party in 1956 following Nikita Khrushchev's disowning of Stalin. In 1958, she was elected the first Mayor of Delhi. She was closely associated with social activists and secularists of her era like Krishna Menon, Vimla Kapoor, Guru Radha Kishan, Premsagar Gupta, Rajani Palme Joti, Sarla Sharma and Subhadra Joshi for social welfare and development in Delhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe and Narayanan started Link publishing house and published a daily newspaper, Patriot and a weekly, Link the same year. The publications became prestigious due to the patronage of leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Krishna Menon and Biju Patnaik. Later she moved out of the publishing house due to internal politics, stunned by greed taking over the creed of her comrades. In 1964, she rejoined the Congress Party but stopped taking part in active politics. Despite reservations about the emergency, she remained close to Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe died in New Delhi on 29 July 1996, aged 87.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAruna Asaf Ali was awarded International Lenin Peace Prize for the year 1964[6] and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1991.[7] She was awarded Indias second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan in her lifetime in 1992, and finally the highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, posthumously in 1997.[8] In 1998, a stamp commemorating her was issued.

Its position allows dry continental air from Eurasia to meet wetter air from the Atlantic Ocean, which causes the weather to be highly variable, often changing many times during the day. It is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K?ppen climate classification system. It is significantly warmer than other regions on the same latitude, due to the warmth provided by the Gulf Stream. Temperatures do not often switch between great extremes, with warm summers and mild winters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe British Isles undergo very small temperature variations. This is due to its proximity to the Atlantic, which acts as a temperature buffer, warming the Isles in winter and cooling them in summer. Coastal areas tend to be more temperate than inland areas, as the influence of the ocean is less acute. Valleys can be especially cold, as cool air collects in them during the winter. July is usually the warmest month, with the highest temperatures being found closest to Continental Europe, in south-east England. Temperatures usually do not reach freezing points, especially in coastal areas. However, the temperature is mainly warm to mediate temperatures.\\r\\nThe sunniest times are the months of May and June, whereas December has the least sunshine. The clearest skies in the British Isles occur over the south of England, due to the winds from the continent. Equally, mountainous areas, especially in the North-west receive barely any sunshine, sometimes less than 1000 hours a year. In winter on north-south valleys there are sometimes only a few hours of sunshine in a day.\\r\\nRadiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft. Fog is more common inland and on higher altitudes; mainly during winter and during the morning at times of high pressure.\\r\\nOn occasions blocking anticyclones (high pressure systems) may move over the British Isles, which can persist for weeks or even months. The subsided, dry air often results in clear skies and few clouds, bringing frosty nights in winter and hot days in the summer, when some coastal areas can achieve almost maximum possible sunshine for periods of weeks.\\r\\nRainfall varies across the Isles, with a general trend to more rain as you go west and in higher elevations. December and January are usually the wettest months. The mountain ranges are the wettest areas in the U.K..[1] These are some of the wettest locations in Britain.[2][3] Most rainfall comes from North Atlantic depressions occur throughout the year and are particularly frequent and intense in the autumn and winter. They can on occasions bring prolonged periods of heavy rain, and flooding is quite common.\\r\\nSnow can occur during winter months, most frequently occurring during January and February. Hail is relatively common, and is most common during the summer months. Each of the United Kingdom's 50 strongest hailstorms on record since 1650 have occurred between the months of May and September. [4]\\r\\nThe prevailing winds over the British Isles are from the south-west, and winds are strongest on coasts that face the Atlantic. Generally, the coast tends to be windier than inland areas; and the west tends to be windier than the east.\\r\\nGales  which are defined as winds with speeds of 51 to 101?km/h (32 to 63?mph) are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the area. The Hebrides experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale force winds). Areas of high elevation tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations.\\r\\nThe British Isles do not experience extreme weather regularly. There have been several occasions where extreme weather events have occurred. In the winter of 1982, for a few days parts of central and southern England experienced temperatures lower than central Europe and Moscow. In contrast, the summers of 1975 and 1976 experienced temperatures as high as 35?C (95?F). It was so dry the country suffered drought and water shortages.[5] Extended periods of extreme weather, such as the drought of 1975ÿ1976 and the very cold winters of 1946ÿ1947, 1962ÿ1963, 1978ÿ79, 1981ÿ1982 and 2009ÿ2010, are often caused by blocking anti-cyclones which can persist several days or even weeks. In winter they can bring long periods of cold dry weather and in summer long periods of hot dry weather.\\r\\nTropical cyclones themselves do not affect the British Isles due to the cold temperature of the surrounding ocean. Any tropical cyclone that comes near the Isles has said to have undergone a process called extratropical transition. The Isles do experience these extratropical cyclones, the Great Storm of 1987 was a deep depression which formed in the Bay of Biscay, which also contained the remnants of Hurricane Floyd.[6] Hurricane Lili of 1996 and Hurricane Gordon of 2006 both were strong extratropical cyclones with tropical storm-force winds, which caused transport closures, power-cuts and flooding. In 2011, the remnants of Hurricane Katia of 2011 brought near hurricane-force winds to Scotland, with sustained winds reaching 70?mph (110?km/h) while centred over the Isle of Lewis. In 2017, Hurricane Ophelia brought severe storms to Ireland, and carried Saharan dust and smoke from wildfires in Portugal into the atmosphere over the United Kingdom, creating red and orange skies across the country.\\r\\nThunderstorms are most common in the south-east, and least common in the north-west.[7] Occasionally, thunderstorms can be severe and produce large hailstones as seen in Ottery St Mary, Devon in October 2008, where drifts reached 1.8 metres (5?ft 11?in).[8]\\r\\nEstimates produced by the Met Office predict average annual temperature to increase by 2C (4F) and the warmest summer day to increase by 3C (6F) by the 2050s. Average winter rainfall is also likely to increase and most areas will see a slight decrease in annual rainfall.[9]\\r\\nRecently the British Isles have undergone some record breaking events. In 2004-2006, a partial drought caused fires to break out throughout the south of Great Britain, and water restrictions were introduced in some areas. The drought problems were solved due to the unusually wet period between October 2006 and July 2007, which had higher than average rainfall.\\r\\nThe year 2006 was an unusually warm one. Although the year started off cool, from April the weather stayed warmer than average. July was the hottest month on record for the United Kingdom,[10]","input":"What provides great britian with a moderate climate?"},{"output":"2006","context":"The Honda Civic is a line of small cars manufactured by Honda. Originally a subcompact, the Civic has gone through several generational changes, becoming both larger and more upmarket and moving into the compact car segment. EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of 110 to 119.9 cubic feet (3,110 to 3,400?L) is considered a mid-size car, and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-end mid-size car, although it still competes in the compact class.[1] The Civic coupe is still considered a compact car. The Civic currently falls between the Honda Fit and Honda Accord.\\r\\nThe first Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door model,[2] followed by a three-door hatchback that September. With an 1169?cc transverse engine and front-wheel drive like the British Mini, the car provided good interior space despite overall small dimensions.[3] Initially gaining a reputation for being fuel-efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly, later iterations have become known for performance and sportiness, especially the Civic Type R, Civic VTi, Civic GTi and Civic SiR/Si.[4][5]\\r\\nThe Civic has been repeatedly rebadged for international markets, and served as the basis for the Honda CR-X, the Honda CR-X del Sol, the Honda Concerto, the first generation Honda Prelude, the Honda Civic Shuttle (later to become the Honda Orthia), and the Honda CR-V.\\r\\nIn Japan, as customers increasingly shifted to minivans and compact cars like Honda Fit, production of non-hybrid Civic ended in August 2010 when it no longer complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations in the width category. However, production of Civic and Civic hybrid for export markets continued.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a period of developing idiosyncratic automobiles such as the lukewarmly received domestic Honda 1300, Honda considered pulling out of automobile manufacturing altogether by the early 1970s. However, the more conventional Civic's release in 1972 immediately changed things, thanks to its economy, reliability and low cost in an era of rising fuel prices. Honda's CVCC technology helped it make it affordable, meeting 1970s and early 1980s emission standards without an expensive catalytic converter.[7]\\r\\nThe first generation Honda Civic was introduced on 11 July 1972, but sold as a 1973 model in Japan. It was equipped with a 1,169?cc (71.3?cu?in) four-cylinder water-cooled engine and featured front power disc brakes, reclining vinyl bucket seats, simulated wood trim on the dashboard, as well as optional air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The Civic was available as a coupe, both a three- and a five-door hatchback, as well as a five-door station wagon. Due to the 1973 oil crisis, consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles was high, and due to the engine being able to run on either leaded or unleaded fuel, it gave drivers fuel choice flexibility over other vehicles. The CVCC engine debuted in 1975 and had a head design that allowed for more efficient combustion, and as a benefit the CVCC system did not require a catalytic converter or unleaded fuel to meet 1975 Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The Civic was joined by a platform expansion of the three-door hatchback, called the Honda Accord in 1976.\\r\\nThe second generation Honda Civic was introduced in June 1979 as a 1980 model. It was larger, had a more angular shape, and came with increased engine power. All Civic engines now used the CVCC design, which added a 3rd valve per cylinder; this introduced lean burn swirl technology. The base 1335 cc (\\"1300\\") engine made 55?hp (41?kW; 56?PS), with an optional 1488 cc (\\"1500\\") engine producing 67?hp (50?kW; 68?PS). Three transmissions were offered: a four-speed manual (on base models), a five-speed manual, and a two-speed semi-automatic Honda had previously called the \\"Hondamatic\\". The second generation Civic was offered as a three-door hatchback, a four-door sedan, a five-door hatchback and a five-door wagon.\\r\\nThe third generation was released in September 1983 for the 1984 model year. The separate five-door hatchback and wagon models were merged into a four-door \\"shuttle wagon\\" or \\"wagovan\\" sometimes referred to colloquially as a \\"breadbox\\" due to its appearance, called the Honda Civic Shuttle. An additional two-seat coupe stylelabeled CRXwas introduced, noted for its compact dimensions and light weight. The third generation Civic saw the introduction of the long running four-cylinder D series engine including a new 1.5?L (91.5?cu?in) CVCC engine. 1984 also saw the release of a high-performance Si model for the Japanese market, featuring upgraded suspension and the 1.6?L (97.6?cu?in) DOHC ZC engine which was rated at 130 PS (118 HP). Si models were offered in the US as a 3-door Civic Si hatchback and the CRX Si variant with a 91 horsepower (68?kW) fuel-injected SOHC 12-valve engine. A 4WD engine with different transmission mounts was introduced for the first time in 1984, and later upgraded in 1987. It delivered a fuel economy of around 28 mpg highway. The 4WD system was push-button operated until improved in 1987 when the rear wheels would engage automatically once the front wheels lost traction. This new system was called \\"Realtime\\" which used a \\"viscous coupler\\" connecting two propeller shafts between the front and rear axles. The manual transmission featured a synchronized 6th gear, called \\"SL\\", or \\"Super-Low\\", which was used for high torque at very low speeds. The \\"Realtime\\" idea is still utilized to this day but includes technological improvements since the first system. Starting with 1985, Japanese Civics were now exclusive to Honda Primo, with variants sold at Honda Verno and Honda Clio. A four-door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by Mercedes Benz South Africa, models were 1300, 1500, 1500i, and 1600i DOHC 1.6 injection.\\r\\nIn September 1987, a redesigned Civic was introduced with increased dimensions and a lower hood line. A wide range of models and trim levels were offered for various markets around the world. The most notable of which was the Japanese market SiR (featuring the B16A DOHC VTEC engine). All U.S. models featured electronic fuel injection, but carbureted models were still available elsewhere. The fourth generation saw the introduction of a fully independent rear suspension across the entire model range.[8] In addition, the Honda CRX continued to be part of the Civic family which included the HF, DX, and Si model in the U.S.A / four door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by Mercedes Benz South Africa / models were 1500 16v, 1600i 16v, and 1600i 16v DOHC. The first 800 cars produced at the then brand new Honda Plant in Aliston Ontario Canada were SE model cars. These Special Edition models included all white side molding that matched the white body and color matched dual mirrors. In the body molding was a wrap around blue stripe. Each car had interior upgrades as well as a chrome tipped exhaust.\\r\\nIntroduced in September 1991 for the 1992 model year, the redesigned Civic featured increased dimensions, as well as more aerodynamic styling. The wagon variant was now only available in the Japanese market where the previous generation wagon was carried over until 1995. The efficiency of the previous HF model was replaced by the VX hatchback which, with an EPA rating of 48/55 MPG, was Honda's most fuel efficient model sold at the time. In North America the Si featured a SOHC VTEC valve train, whereas the VX featured the VTEC-E. The Japanese Si featured a DOHC non-VTEC valve train D16A9. Continuing in the sporty tradition of the original Civic SiR, Honda sold several similarly equipped variants of the fifth generation car, still referred to as the Civic SiR, in Japan, Asia, and Europe. In South Africa, MBSA (Mercedes Benz of SA) built the Civic as the Ballade only in 4dr. A special model was the 180i with the B18B4, that was fitted to Ballade models. A new bodystyle was introduced with this generation called the Civic Coupe, based from the Civic Ferio sedan, and was sold in North America, Europe and Japan. The fifth generation remains popular among tuners and racers alike.\\r\\nIntroduced in September 1995 for the 1996 model year, the sixth generation featured updated styling although less radical than previous redesigns. Suspension and engine options were available along with their first Natural Gas Powered Civic, the GX. In the US, model year 1996 to 2000 the Civic was sold under the CX, DX, EX, EXR, HX, LX, and for Canada, SE, and Si trims; all base models were made with 1.6-liter engines. The EX-CX are all SOHC (Honda D engine). The CX, DX, and LX all have D16Y7 non-VTEC engines; whereas the EX has a D16Y8 VTEC, and the HX has D16Y5 VTEC-E. The USDM Si and Canadian SiR came with a DOHC (B16A2 VTEC). The first Civic Si coupe EM1 was introduced in 1999 until 2000. Europe saw a DOHC 1.6 VTi hatch and sedan and a DOHC 1.8L engine was available for the Domani related five-door liftback and estate.\\r\\nThe seventh generation was released in September 2000, for the 2001 model year. While the redesign retained the previous generation's exterior dimensions, interior space was improved in part by using a flat rear floor thus bumping up Civic to a compact car size segment. The front suspension was changed from that of a double wishbone to a MacPherson strut, in order to lower costs, as well as allow more engine bay room for the newly introduced Honda K-series engine. Power was also increased on some trim levels. The four main trim levels were DX, LX, EX, and HX. The Civic Coupe was no longer sold in Japan starting with this generation.\\r\\nIn North America, coupe and sedan body styles were available, except for the Si (SiR in Canada) which was offered only as a three-door hatchback.[9] The rest of the world received three and five-door hatchbacks. The Type R was redesigned as well this time using a more powerful i-VTEC motor and using the three-door hatchback body style. This generation saw Honda introduce their first Civic Hybrid, powered by a 1.3-liter engine.[10]\\r\\nThe eighth generation was released in September 2005, for the 2006 model year. For the eighth generation, Honda split the model into two different platforms, one for sedan and coupe, and one for a hatchback designed primarily for the European market using a simpler rear suspension from the Honda Fit and more aggressive styling. As of 2006, a total of 16.5?million Civics had been sold worldwide, with 7.3?million of them in the United States.[11] Although the North American and the home market model differ externally, they are mechanically identical. The hatchback is available as a three and five-door. Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R, while sharing the same engine size, are mechanically different. In the US, an improved, sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tuner Mugen was offered, featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension, wheels, slight exterior differences, and exhaust system. A Canadian only Acura model received a new nameplate, changing from the Acura EL to the Acura CSX. The end of this model generation also marked a hiatus of the Civic Type R in Japan, with no successor model until the later tenth generation, going on sale mid-2017[12].\\r\\nOn 13 December 2010, Honda unveiled a sketch of the new ninth-generation Civic which was described as \\"energetic, sleek and aerodynamic.\\" Both coupe and sedan concepts were shown on 10 January 2011 at the 2011 North American International Auto Show. The production version of the ninth-generation Civic (previewed by the concept) went on sale in the U.S. on 20 April 2011.[13] In late 2012, Honda updated its Civic model with new exterior and interior trims for the 2013 year.[14]\\r\\nHonda's Eco Assist technology is added to most models, and became the first gasoline-only powered Honda to employ such technology in North America. It is an information system to help the driver adopt a more fuel-efficient driving style,[15] and is proven to improve fuel economy by about 10% for Honda's hybrid vehicle in Japan.[16]\\r\\nAll models now come standard with ABS (Anti-Lock Brake Systems), VSA (Vehicle Stability Assistance) and EBD (Electronic Brake Distribution). Further improvements include a new multilink rear suspension to further reduce road feel on particularly battered roads and highways.\\r\\nFollowing its launch, the new model was widely panned by the automotive press due to the poor quality of its interior and ride, and for the first time, it failed to earn a Consumer Reports recommendation. In an unprecedented move, Honda made significant interior and exterior redesigns the following year to address these issues, but market share in the compact car segment showed a marked decline from the previous generation.[17]\\r\\nThe Civic is based on an all-new Honda compact global platform.[18]\\r\\nThe tenth-generation Civic features a new fastback exterior design, with the rear C-pillar flowing into the tailgate. The front of the car features a new chrome wing design that flows across the top of the headlamps.\\r\\nThe interior of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, the EX and above trim levels of the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital \\"Driver Information Interface\\" incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly behind the steering wheel and in the driver's line of sight.[19] The LX trim instrumentation consists of a large analog tachometer that surrounds a digital speedometer and other digital displays.\\r\\nCivic variants include sedan, coupe, five-door hatchback, Si trims, and Type-R models.\\r\\nWhile the Civic is sold in largely the same form worldwide, differences in the name of the models exist between markets. In Japan, the hatchback Civic is just called \\"Civic\\" while the sedan model was called the Civic Ferio (Japanese: Ͱ) during the fifth to seventh generations. The sixth-generation sedan was also sold as the Integra SJ. In Europe and the United States, \\"Civic\\" generically refers to any model, though in Europe the coupe is branded the \\"Civic Coupe\\". A four-door station wagon model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the Honda Stream). In South Africa, the sedan (the only model sold there until the 1996 launch of the sixth generation sedan and hatch) was known as the Ballade.\\r\\nOther models have been built on the Civic platform, including Prelude, Ballade, CR-X, Quint, Concerto, Domani, CR-X Del Sol, Integra, and CR-V.\\r\\nAlso, at various times, the Civic or Civic-derived models have been sold by marques other than Honda?ÿ for example, Rover sold the 200, 400 and 45, each of which were Civic-based at some point (first 200s were the second generation Ballade; from 1990 the 200 and 400 were based on the Concerto; the 400 was the 1995 Domani), as was their predecessor, the Triumph Acclaim, based on the first Honda Ballade. The Honda Domani, an upscale model based on the Civic, was sold as the Isuzu Gemini in Japan (1992ÿ2000), and confusingly the 5-door Domani was sold as the Honda Civic (along with the \\"real\\" hatchback and sedan Civics) in Europe from 1995 to 2000. In Thailand, the sixth generation Civic was available as the four-door Isuzu Vertex. The sixth-generation station wagon was sold as the Honda Orthia, with the Partner as the downmarket commercial variant. The seventh generation minivan model is called the Honda Stream. In Canada, the sixth and seventh generation Civics were mildly redesigned to create the Acura EL until the advent of the eight generation Civic, which was used to create the Acura CSX, which was designed in Canada. Honda Japan adopted the CSX styling for the Civic in its home country.\\r\\nThe three-door hatchback body style has been somewhat unpopular in the United States, but has achieved wide acceptance in Canada, as well as popularity in Japan and European markets, helping cement Honda's reputation as a maker of sporty compact models. Starting in 2002, the Civic three-door hatchback has been built exclusively at Honda's manufacturing plant in Swindon, England[20] ÿ previously the five-door Civic/Domani and the Civic Aerodeck (based on the Japanese Orthia) were built in this plant for sale in Europe along with the Japanese Civics. Accordingly, all instances of the current model (left or right hand drive, anywhere in the world) are British-made cars designed with Japanese engineering, except for the US-built two-door coupe and the sedan version built in Brazil for the Latin American market.\\r\\nIn North America, the Civic hatchback was dropped for 2006. The 2006 model year standard Civics for North America are manufactured in Alliston, Ontario, Canada (sedans, coupes and Si Coupes) and East Liberty, Ohio (sedans), while the Hybrid version is manufactured in Japan.\\r\\nIn Brazil, although being considered for local manufacturing since the early 1980s (it was illegal to import cars in Brazil from 1973 until 1990), the Civic wasn't available until 1992, via official importing. In 1997, production of the sixth generation Civic sedan started in the Sumar (a city near Campinas, in the state of S?o Paulo) factory. The only differences between the Japanese model and the Brazilian model were a slightly higher ground clearance, due to the country's road conditions and adaptations to make the engine suitable to Brazilian commercial gasoline, which contains about 25% ethanol (E25). The seventh generation production started in 2001, displacing the Chevrolet Vectra from the top sales record for the mid-size sedan segment, however it lost that position to the Toyota Corolla the following year. In 2006, the eighth generation was released and regained the sales leadership. Identical to the North American version, it lacks options such a moonroof, and standard security equipment like VSA and side and curtain airbags were removed due to lack of car safety laws in the Mercosur. Furthermore, the Brazilian subsidiary began producing flex-fuel versions for the Civic and the Fit models, capable of running on any blend of gasoline (E20 to E25 blend in Brazil) and ethanol up to E100.[21]\\r\\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the USA has determined frontal crash test ratings of Honda Civics of different model years.[22][23]\\r\\nThe eighth-generation Civic sedan's crash test performance has been rated highly by both the US government's NHTSA[24] and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS awarded the Civic sedan with a rating of \\"good\\" on both frontal and side impact crash tests[25] and lists the Civic as the second-best 2007 small car in overall crashworthiness.[26] The Civic coupe is rated \\"acceptable\\" in the side impact test.[27]\\r\\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test ratings[24]\\r\\nFrontal impact: \\r\\nSide impact front seat: \\r\\nSide impact rear seat: \\r\\nRollover: \\r\\nIn Australia, 1984ÿ2005 Civics were assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 on their level of occupant protection regardless of size or era.[28]\\r\\nDespite being a modest car, the Civic is popular as a platform for modification and customization by the enthusiast community. Starting with the fourth generation and continuing through the 2000 model year, Civics had front double wishbone suspension and rear semi-trailing arm suspension. Ready parts interchangeability allows easy engine swaps (primarily with more powerful B16A (Civic SI), B18C (Acura Integra GSR), and various K20 Civic motors) and many other upgrades.[29]\\r\\nMore recent seventh and eighth generation Civics, now rated as compacts rather than subcompacts, remain generally attractive as tuner projects in spite of added weight (mostly due to U.S. government safety mandates, such as airbags and ABS) and higher centers of gravity. Particularly unwelcome among the tuner community[30] was the replacement of the front double-wishbone suspension with MacPherson struts, which provide inferior handling primarily due to limited dynamic camber angle control.[31][32]\\r\\nHonda Civic EX was International Car of the Year in 2005. From 1972 to 1974, the Civic was awarded Car of the Year Japan. In 1973, the Civic ranked third in the European Car of the Year awards, the highest ranking for a Japanese vehicle at that time. It also was awarded the U.S. Road Test magazine's \\"1974 Car of the Year.\\"[33] The Civic was the Motor Trend Import Car of the Year for 1980[34] as well as its 2006 Car of the Year. In 2006, the Civic earned the 2007 \\"Semperit Irish Car of the Year\\" title. In 1996, Automobile Magazine honored the Civic as its Automobile of the Year. The Civic has been on Car and Driver magazine's yearly Ten Best list six times, in 1985, 1988ÿ91, and 1996. The Civic Si was named \\"Best New Sport Car\\" and the sedan was named \\"Best New Economy Car\\" in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year awards. The Civic also won the North American Car of the Year and the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) Car of the Year awards for 2006. In November 2006, the Civic received the prestigious \\"Car of The Year\\" award from Brazilian magazine Auto Esporte. The four-door Civic VXi sedan won the South African Car of the Year award for 2007.\\r\\nCivics have been used for racing ever since their introduction.\\r\\nCivics contested the Up to 1300cc class in the Bathurst 1000 touring car race at Bathurst in Australia each year from 1973 to 1976, with a best placing of second in class in both 1974 and 1976.[35]\\r\\nIn recent years the Civic has been used in a wide variety of racing series, particularly in Japan. It is also used in touring car races in Europe and the United States. The Civic has been used in the UK in endurance series by teams such as Barwell Motorsport and Cartek Motorsport.\\r\\nIn 2002 JAS Motorsport entered the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) with a Super 2000 spec Civic and was used until restart season of the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) in 2005.\\r\\nIn December 2005, on the date of the new 2006 Civic Si's launch in the USA, Honda's R&D Engineering Team completed 645 laps in an eighth generation Civic Si coupe (FG2) to place first in the E1 class of the famous '25 Hours of Thunderhill' marathon race. The drivers on Honda's team were Road & Track journalist Kim Wolfkill, Lee Niffenegger, Chad Gilsinger, Sage Marie, John Sherk, Rich Hays, Andrew Frame, Matt Staal and Car and Driver journalist Tony Swan.[36]\\r\\nIn the UK, the Civic has been used in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) for several years and is still highly competitive. The Civic Type R made its debut in the 2002 season with the 'Works' team run by Arena Motorsport. Built to BTC-T specifications, it gained the team third in the manufacturers championship. In the same year Synchro Motorsport won the BTCC Production Teams Championship with a pair of Civic Type Rs.\\r\\nThe 2003 season saw the 'works' team Civics secure an impressive second in the manufacturers championship. The 2003 BTCC Production Teams Championship also went to the Civic again, this time in the hands of Barwell Motorsport.\\r\\nSuch was the competitiveness of the Civic in its first two-season, 2004 saw five teams enter Civics, allowing the model to secure second in the manufacturers championship.\\r\\nAlthough manufacturer support from Honda for the BTCC ended in 2005, several teams still found success running the Civic in 2005 and 2006.\\r\\nFor the 2007 BTCC season, Team Halfords ran the new eighth-generation Honda Civics, built to the latest S2000 regulations, for Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden with limited success and continued to use the Civic into the 2008 and 2009 season. In both 2007 and 2008, the Civic allowed the team to finish 3rd in the Teams championship, behind the two manufacturer backed teams.\\r\\nIn 2010 Honda returned to the BTCC as a 'works' team with Team Dynamics using Civics to win the 2010 manufacturers championship.[37]\\r\\nIn 2011 the team returns with its Civic to defend its Team and Manufacturers championship again with the Neil and Shedden pairing.\\r\\nHonda Racing Team swapped to the brand new ninth generation Honda Civic, built fully to NGTC rules, for the 2012 BTCC season. They are the first manufacturer backed team to announce their intention to run fully to the NGTC specification.[38][39] The drivers continue to be Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden, who are the 2011 and 2012 BTCC driver champions respectively.[40][41] Andrew Jordan, driving for his family-run Eurotech Racing team, won the BTCC title in 2013 in their NGTC Civic, whilst Honda retained the manufacturer's championship.[42] However, in 2014, Honda were unable to retain their title, which was won instead by MG.[43]\\r\\nHonda announced plans to enter the 2012 World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) with a racer built on the 2012 Euro Civic five-door hatchback. The car is powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged engine, developed by Honda R&D, and would later race in Japan, China and Macau before a two car team joined the 2013 championship racing.[44] Honda won the 2013 Manufacturers' Championship in their first full season in the series, six races before the end of the season.[45] However, Honda was unsuccessful in defending their title in 2014, as Citro?n dominated the series in their first season.[46][47]\\r\\nThe car has also been used in the Japanese Touring Car Championship, and won the 2011 Asian Touring Car Series. It also competed in both the Touring and Super-production classes of the Russian Touring Car Championship.\\r\\nAs of February 2015, 18.5?million Civics had been sold worldwide.[48] With 7.3?million bought in the United States,[11] it has been a top seller both there[49][50][51] and in Canada, where it had placed No. 1 for 14 years through 2012.[52] Recent studies indicate that the Honda Civic is the most popular car among millennial car shoppers,[53] credited for its low price and small size.","input":"When was the last honda civic hatchback made?"},{"output":"7 fatalities out of 439 horses taking part between 2000 and 2010","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nModern steeplechase races have an average of just over 4 equine fatalities for every 1,000 horses taking part, according to the British Horseracing Authority.[1] However, the Grand National, a popular steeplechase held annually in England, yielded 7 fatalities out of 439 horses taking part between 2000 and 2010.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand National is a National Hunt handicap race over a distance of 4 miles 3? furlongs and over 30 fences at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool. The high number of equine deaths in the race has made it a target for animal rights activists. While course officials have repeatedly taken safety measures over the years, such as improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of fences,[4] some have campaigned for further modifications or the abolition of the event that was inaugurated in 1839.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 1989 Grand National, in which two horses died in incidents at Becher's Brook (the sixth and 22nd fence on the course), Aintree began making significant changes to the fences that are jumped during the National. The brook on the landing-side of Becher's was filled in to prevent horses rolling back into it, and the incline on the landing-side has been mostly levelled out, whilst retaining a drop to slow the runners. Other fences have been reduced in height, toe-boards have been made taller, and the entry requirements for participating horses have been made stricter, such as the requirement for runners to have been placed fourth or better in a previous recognised steeplechase over a distance of at least three miles.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome within the horseracing community, including some with notable achievements in the Grand National, such as Ginger McCain and Bob Champion,[6][7][8] have argued that the lowering of fences and the narrowing of ditches, primarily designed to increase horse safety, has had the adverse effect by encouraging the runners to race faster. During the 1970s and 1980s the Grand National saw a total of 12 horses die (half of which were at Becher's Brook); in the next 20-year period from 1990 to 2010, when modifications to the course were most significant, there were 17 equine fatalities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports counts the number of horse deaths at 40 over the three-day meet from the year 2000 to 2013.[9] The following list details the equine fatalities during, or as a direct result of participating in, the Grand National, that is, the showpiece steeplechase itself rather than all the various races held over the entire three-day \\"Grand National meeting\\" (which includes two other races over one circuit of the National course: the Fox Hunters for amateur jockeys and the Topham for professional jockeys).

The constitution states in Article 39, \\"All citizens shall have the duty of national defense under the conditions as prescribed by Act.\\"[4][5] The Military Service Act of 1949, which was implemented in 1957, specified that compulsory military service is required for men ages 18 or older.[6][2] Conscription is managed by the Military Manpower Administration, which was created in 1948.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy law, when a Korean man turns 18 years old, he is enlisted for \\"first citizen service,\\" meaning he is liable for military duty, but is not yet required to serve.[6][8] When he turns 19 years old (or, in some instances, 20 years old), he is required to undergo a physical exam to determine whether he is suitable for military service. The table below shows the physical exam's possible grades and their outcomes, according to the Military Service Act.[9] Men must enlist by the time they turn 28 (Korean age).[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe length of compulsory military service in South Korea varies based on military branch.[11] Active duty soldiers serve 21 months in the Army or Marine Corps, 23 months in the Navy, and 24 months in the Air Force.[12] After conscripts finish their military service, they are automatically placed on the reserve roster and are obligated to attend a few days of annual military training for 6 years.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-active duty personnel, or \\"supplemental service\\" personnel serve for various lengths: 24 months for social work personnel or international cooperation service personnel; 34 months for arts and sports personnel or industrial technical personnel; and 36 months for public health doctors, lawyers, veterinarians, or expert researchers.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth Korea currently has among the longest military service periods in the world, ranked behind Israel, Singapore, and North Korea.[citation needed] In 2010, there was growing public pressure to either shorten the length of conscription or to switch to voluntary military service, and calls from experts for a gradual phasing out of conscription rather than complete abolition.[14]  However, in December 2010, after taking into consideration of the 2010 ROKS Cheonan sinking and Bombardment of Yeonpyeong incidents, the South Korean government said it would not reduce service periods.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent conscription regulations stipulate that athletes who win medals in the Olympic Games or gold medals in the Asian Games are granted exemptions from military service and are placed in Grade 4.[16] They are required to do four weeks of basic military training and engage in sports field for 42 months. After that, they are automatically placed on the reserve roster, and are obligated to attend a few days of annual military training for six years. In practice, after athletes finish their four weeks of basic military training, they are able to continue their own sports career during the 34 months of duty.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable athletes who have been granted exemptions from military service are the bronze medal-winning football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics,[18][19] 2008 Olympic gold medalist badminton player Lee Yong-dae[20], swimmer Park Tae-hwan[21][22], 2014 Asian Games gold medalist tennis player Hyeon Chung[23] and 2018 Asian Games gold medalist footballer Son Heung Min.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe right to conscientious objection is not recognised in South Korea.[24] Usually, over 400 people are imprisoned at any one time for refusing military service, for political or religious reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following data is from 'Regulation on Public Servant Compensation', implemented on 1 January 2017.[25]  Exchange rate as of 2 May 2018 (?1077 to $1.00USD)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ministry of National Defense has revealed that it has failed to provide sneakers to 7,411 recruits who joined the military from 22 May to 4 June 2012, after the budget was insufficient for need. The Defense ministry originally projected the cost of each pair of sneakers to be 11,000 KRW. However, the actual cost turned out to be 15,000 KRW.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of National Assembly member Kim Kwang-jin of Democratic United Party revealed that cadets in Korea Military Academy were provided with sneakers worth 60,000 KRW and tennis shoes. Cadets in Korea Army Academy at Yeongcheon were provided with sneakers worth 64,250 KRW, in addition to running shoes and soccer shoes.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor dual citizens, or those with multiple citizenships, male South Koreans must choose their citizenship by the time they turn 18, before March 31 of that year. If these males choose to revoke their South Korean citizenship, they will not be required to complete their mandatory military service. However, if they fail to choose their citizenship by their 18th year, they will be subjected to fulfill their mandatory military service.[28]\\r\\nIf males choose to renounce their citizenship by their 18th year, they are ineligible to gain a Korean work visa (F series) until after they turn 40 years of age. It may still be possible to gain an E series visa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe South Korean public is sensitive towards the country's mandatory military service, and has an absolute zero-tolerance towards those who attempt to dodge or receive special treatment, especially after scandals of wealthy families caught trying to avoid their national duty. Those found or accused of draft dodging and negligence of duty often face harsh penalties and public backlash. According to Ha Jae-keun, a South Korean pop columnist, \\"The mood against draft-dodgers and negligence of duty is so hostile that nowadays entertainers feel it's better to get it over and done with.\\"[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2002, right before Korean American pop singer Steve Yoo was due to be drafted for his military service, he gave up his Korean nationality and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was born in Seoul and migrated to the United States at the age of 13. The South Korean government considered it an act of desertion and deported him, banning him from entering the country permanently.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 2004, it was revealed that actor Song Seung-heon had avoided his draft by taking medication to fail the military physical examination. Song had previously been exempted by claiming to have severe diabetes and high blood pressure, but that was found by the South Korean government to be false.[32] Amidst press coverage and public outcry, Song publicly apologized and agreed to immediately serve his two-year term in the military. Song was discharged on 15 November 2006 with the rank of Corporal.[33][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 April 2011, rapper MC Mong was cleared of intentionally pulling out healthy teeth to be exempted from military duty but was sentenced to a suspended jail term of 6 months, probation for one year, and 120 hours of community service, for deliberately delaying enlistment on false grounds.[35] The court acknowledged that there was a delay in his military enlistment; however, they were unable to determine whether he was guilty of extracting teeth for the purpose of avoiding his military draft. In September 2011, it was reported that Mong has been banned by Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) from appearing in its TV shows, for draft dodging.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2012 Kim Mu-yeol came under growing public criticism over allegations he dodged his compulsory military service. In a report released by the Korean Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), Kim was deemed fit to serve in active duty as a level two recruit after a March 2001 physical examination. However, throughout 2007 to 2009, Kim was granted postponement on the grounds that he was taking civil service examinations or had been admitted to a work training facility, neither of which took place. During this time he reportedly earned approximately ?300 million from films, musicals and television work. In December 2009, he received his final notice for enlistment, having used up the 730 days allowed for postponement. He submitted a request to change his military status in January 2010 because of a knee injury, which was rejected. Finally, a valid exemption was granted on the grounds that he was a \\"low-income individual\\" and the sole provider for his family. BAI's contention was that Kim's income is substantially higher than the standard for disqualification due to poverty; thus, the Military Manpower Administration was negligent in their duties by granting the exemption.[37][38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nKim's agency Prain TPC defended him, stating that Kim had been supporting his family by working as a security guard, construction worker and at a mobile phone factory since his late teens. When his father collapsed from a cerebral hemorrhage and was diagnosed with cancer in 2008, the treatments incurred a lot of debt for the family. Their worsening financial condition caused them to become totally dependent on Kim, resulting in his said filing for an exemption in 2010.[40] Given the publicity, a reinvestigation into the case was launched and Kim was asked by the production company to leave the film 11 A.M. (he was replaced by Choi Daniel).[41][42] On 4 October 2012, Kim released a statement that though there was no wrongdoing on his part, he had decided to voluntarily enter the army \\"to recover his honor damaged by the rumors.\\"[43][44]\\r\\n\\r\\nT.O.P began his two-year mandatory military service on February 9, 2017 as a conscripted police officer, where he was set to be discharged on November 8, 2018 after completing the requirements.[45] However, it was announced in June that he would be prosecuted without detention for use of marijuana.[46] He was subsequently transferred to a different police division to await notice of prosecution, and was suspended from police duty pending verdict on his case.[47] A few days after the announcement, T.O.P was found unconscious in police barracks due to a suspected anti-anxiety medicine overdose of prescribed benzodiazepine,[48] and was hospitalized.[49] On June 8, T.O.P's mother confirmed that her son had opened his eyes and was recovering.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 29, T.O.P faced his first trial for the marijuana usage charges at the Seoul Central District Court.[51] He pleaded guilty to the charges against him and admitted that he did smoke marijuana on two out of the four instances.[52] T.O.P received two years of probation, with a possibility of ten months' jail time if he violates any terms.[53] At the second court hearing the following month, T.O.P was sentenced to 10 months in prison suspended for two years for illegal marijuana use.[54] He acknowledged all guilty charges. After undergoing a disciplinary review by the police to decide if T.O.P could return as a conscripted policeman or will complete his service as a public service officer,[55] the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency reviewed T.O.P's current condition and decided T.O.P is unfit to resume service in his previous position.[56][57] A request was made to Army headquarters for a new position for T.O.P to determine either to serve as a public service worker of a full-time reserve soldier to complete his mandatory service.[58][59] T.O.P was eventually assigned reservist status by the Ministry of National Defense and transferred from police department.[60] He will complete his mandatory service as a public service worker.[61] The time T.O.P had been dismissed from duty during his prosecution will not count towards his total service.[62][63]","input":"How long do you have to be in the korean army?"},{"output":"Ike Ekweremadu","context":"The Deputy President of the Nigerian Senate is second highest-ranking member of the Senate of Nigeria, after the President of the Senate.

Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\\r\\nDemocracy in its earliest forms is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks and Romans, who were themselves considered the founders of Western civilization by the 18th century intellectuals who attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization.[2] The extent to which these 18th century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks and Romans into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of empire following the end of the Second World War.\\r\\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gulf between the Hobbesian 'state of nature' and the grip of authoritarianism through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropologists have identified forms of proto-democracy that date back to small bands of hunter gatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian, settled, societies and still exist virtually unchanged in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50-100 individuals, often tied closely by familial bonds, decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief.[4] Given that these dynamics are still alive and well today, it is plausible to assume that democracy in one form or another arises naturally in any well-bonded group or tribe.\\r\\nThese types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism, or primitive democracy. In this sense, a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are face-to-face discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government.[5] This becomes more complex on a larger scale, such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule ÿ including monarchy, tyranny, aristocracy, and oligarchy ÿ have flourished in more urban centers, often those with concentrated populations.[6]\\r\\nThe concepts (and name) of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 B.C. In ancient Greece, where there were many city-states with different forms of government, democracy was contrasted with governance by elites (aristocracy), by one person (monarchy), by tyrants (tyranny), etc.,\\r\\nIn recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred somewhere else (i.e. other than Greece) first, as Greece developed its complex social and political institutions long after the appearance of the earliest civilizations in Egypt and the Near East.[7]\\r\\nStudying pre-Babylonian Mesopotamia, renowned scholar Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic, myth, and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this, Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free male citizens, although \\"the various functions of government are as yet little specialised [and] the power structure is loose\\". In early Sumer, kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather, major city-states functioned with councils of elders and \\"young men\\" (likely free men bearing arms) that possessed the final political authority, and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war.[8][9]\\r\\nAlthough pioneering in nature, the work has invoked little serious discussion and gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word \\"democracy\\" in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted convincingly to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes, a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority.[10] Jacobsen has conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy.[11]\\r\\nAnother claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent \\"republics\\" of India, sanghas and ganas, which existed as early as the 6th century B.C. and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period. In addition, Diodorusa Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of Indiamentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.[12] Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century B.C. and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.[13][14]\\r\\nKey characteristics of the gana seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority. Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the gana, the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of K'satriya Varna. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.[15] The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families. On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.[16]\\r\\nScholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy.[17][18] Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation was truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the Artha' shastra, an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sangas, which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizensa surprising omission if democratic bodies, not the aristocratic families, actively controlled the republican governments.[19] Another issue is the persistence of the four-tiered Varna class system.[17] The duties and privileges on the members of each particular casterigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another ordermight have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state, regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decision-making power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ganas and sanghas is not comparable to truly democratic institutions.[18]\\r\\nAncient Greece, in its early period, was a loose collection of independent city states called poleis. Many of these poleis were oligarchies.[20] The most prominent Greek oligarchy, and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared, was Sparta. Yet Sparta, in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator, was a peculiar kind of oligarchy[21] and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy.[22][23][24] In Spartan government, the political power was divided between four bodies: two Spartan Kings (diarchy), gerousia (Council of Gerontes (Elders), including the two kings), the ephors (representatives of the citizens who oversaw the Kings) and the apella (assembly of Spartans).\\r\\nThe two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously, but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory, any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However, in practice, they were selected from wealthy, aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella, the most democratic element, was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors, and accepted or rejected gerousia's proposals.[25] Finally, the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and, if necessary, depose them. They served for one year and could not be re-elected for a second term. Over the years, the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of state. Additionally, they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system, which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As Aristotle noted, ephors were the most important key institution of state, but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office, with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed.[26][27]\\r\\nThe creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt, Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the city-states of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues: equality (among citizens), military fitness, and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government, the gerousia and the apella.[28]\\r\\nThe reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of rules/laws called Great Rhetra, making it the world's first written constitution.[29] In the following centuries, Sparta became a military superpower, and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability.[30] In particular, the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as ? (Homoioi, men of equal status). It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system, agoge, where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education.[24] This was admired almost universally by contemporaries, from historians such as Herodotus and Xenophon to philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In addition, the Spartan women, unlike elsewhere, enjoyed \\"every kind of luxury and intemperance\\" including rights such as the right to inheritance, property ownership, and public education.[31]\\r\\nOverall, the Spartans were remarkably free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However, despite these democratic elements in the Spartan constitution, there are two cardinal criticisms, classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First, individual freedom was restricted, since as Plutarch writes \\"no man was allowed to live as he wished\\", but as in a \\"military camp\\" all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second, the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies.[32][33]\\r\\nThe political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger, especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the Persian Wars. In addition, Athens, after the Persian Wars, was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Peloponnesian War, with Sparta prevailing in the end. However, the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later, when Philip II of Macedon crushed what remained of the power of the factional city states to his South.\\r\\nAlthough Athens was not one of the earliest Greek democracies, it is often regarded as the birthplace of democracy and remains a really important reference point of democracy.i[?]\\r\\nAthens emerged in the 7th century BCE, like many other poleis, with a dominating powerful aristocracy.[34] However, this domination led to exploitation, creating significant economic, political, and social problems. These problems were exacerbated early in the 6th century; and, as \\"the many were enslaved to few, the people rose against the notables\\".[35] At the same time, a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. Sparta's constitutional reforms by Lycurgus introduced a hoplite state that showed, in turn, how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory.[36] After a period of unrest between the rich and poor, Athenians of all classes turned to Solon to act as a mediator between rival factions, and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems.[37][38]\\r\\nSolon, an Athenian (Greek) of noble descent but moderate means, was a Lyric poet and later a lawmaker; Plutarch placed him as one of the Seven Sages of the ancient world.[38] Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority.[39] Solon divided the Athenians into four property classes, with different rights and duties for each. As the Rhetra did in the Lycurgian Sparta, Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. Now, all citizens were entitled to attend the Ecclesia (Assembly) and vote. Ecclesia became, in principle, the sovereign body, entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the courts.[38] All but those in the poorest group might serve, a year at a time, on a new Boule of 400, which was to prepare business for Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts, archons (magistrates), were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the Areopagus (Council of the Hill of Ares), and like the Gerousia in Sparta, it was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed timocratic and democratic system of institutions.[40]\\r\\nOverall, the reforms of the lawgiver Solon in 594 BC were devised to avert the political, economic, and moral decline in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians, established rules for legal redress against over-reaching aristocratic archons, and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than noble birth. Some of his reforms failed in the short term, yet he is often credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy.[41][42]\\r\\nEven though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes, it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship, the chief executive post. Peisistratus became tyrant of Athens three times and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus succeeded him.[43]\\r\\nAfter the fall of tyranny and before the year 508ÿ507 was over, Cleisthenes proposed a complete reform of the system of government, which later was approved by the popular Ecclesia.[44] Cleisthenes reorganized the population into ten tribes, with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones,[45] and improve the army's organization.[46] He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all, isonomia,[44] by expanding access to power to more citizens.[47] During this period, the word \\"democracy\\" (Greek: Ѵϫ?ϫ ÿ \\"rule by the people\\") was first used by the Athenians to define their new system of government.[48] In the next generation, Athens entered in its Golden Age by becoming a great center of literature and art.[49] The victories in Persian Wars encouraged the poorest Athenians (who participated in the military exhibitions) to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s, Ephialtes and Pericles presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society, by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed thetes (Athenians without wealth) to occupy public office.[50] Pericles was distinguished as its greatest democratic leader, even though he has been accused of running a political machine. In the following passage, Thucydides recorded Pericles, in the funeral oration, describing the Athenian system of rule:\\r\\nThe Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom, through the reforms of Solon, and equality (isonomia), introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles, the Athenians used lot for selecting officials. Lot's rationale was to ensure all citizens were \\"equally\\" qualified for office, and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used.[52] Moreover, in most positions chosen by lot, Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once; this rotation in office meant that no-one could build up a power base through staying in a particular position.[53]\\r\\nAnother important political institution in Athens was the courts; they were composed of a large number of juries with no judges, and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool, also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders.[6] Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory,[54] and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being \\"drafted\\" to office. The only officials chosen by elections, one from each tribe, were the strategoi (generals), where military knowledge was required, and the treasurers, who had to be wealthy, since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurer's private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by majority vote in Ecclesia (compare direct democracy), in which all male citizens could participate (in some cases with a quorum of 6000). The decisions taken in Ecclesia were executed by Boule of 500, which had already approved the agenda for Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year[55] and no citizen could serve more than twice.[56]\\r\\nOverall, the Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people, but also directest in the sense that the people through the assembly, boule, and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business.[57] And even though the rights of the individual (probably) were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense,ii[?] the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government, but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person.[48]\\r\\nWithin the Athenian democratic environment, many philosophers from all over the Greek world gathered to develop their theories. Socrates was the first to raise the question, further expanded by his pupil Plato, about the relation/position of an individual within a community. Aristotle continued the work of his teacher, Plato, and laid the foundations of political philosophy. The political philosophy created in Athens was, in the words of Peter Hall, \\"in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium\\".[58] Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek city-states had and categorized them into three categories based on how many ruled: the many (democracy/polity), the few (oligarchy/aristocracy), a single person (tyranny or today autocracy/monarchy). For Aristotle, the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work Politics:\\r\\nThe Athenian democracy, in its two centuries of life-time, twice voted against its democratic constitution, both during the crisis at the end of the Pelopponesian War, creating first the Four Hundred (in 411 BCE) and second Sparta's puppet rgime of the Thirty Tyrants (in 404 BCE). Both votes were under manipulation and pressure, but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants removed most law-making authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected law-making juries known as \\"nomothetai.\\" Athens restored again its democratic constitution, after the unification by force of Greece from Phillip II of Macedon and later Alexander the Great, but it was politically shadowed by the Hellenistic empires. Finally after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BC, Athens was restricted to matters of local administration.\\r\\nHowever, the decline of democracy was not only due to external powers, but from its citizens, such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Through their influential works, after the rediscovery of classics during renaissance, Sparta's political stability was praised,[60][61][62] while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule, where either the less well-born, the mob (as a collective tyrant), or the poorer classes were holding power.[48] It was only centuries afterwards, with the publication of \\"A history of Greece\\" by George Grote in 1846, that the Athenian democracy of Pericles started to be viewed positively by political thinkers.[63] Over the last two decades, scholars have re-examined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and a \\"post-modern\\" example for communities and organizations alike.[64]\\r\\nEven though Rome is classified as a Republic and not a democracy, its history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved.[65] Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries,[66] and today's modern (representative) democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models.[67]\\r\\nRome was a city-state in Italy next to powerful neighbors; Etruscans had built city-states throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other city-states, Rome was ruled by a king. However, social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus.[68][69] A new constitution was crafted, but the conflict between the ruling families (patricians) and the rest of the population, the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite, written, and secular laws. The patrician priests, who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes, by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands, the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers.[68][69] When they returned, the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men ÿ a decemviri ÿ to formulate a new code, and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission, under the supervision of a resolute reactionary, Appius Claudius, transformed the old customary law of Rome into Twelve Tables and submitted them to the Assembly (which passed them with some changes) and they were displayed in the Forum for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE, the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state.\\r\\nThe political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution[70] and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution: two consuls, embodying the monarchic form; the Senate, embodying the aristocratic form; and the people through the assemblies.[71] The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate.[72] Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees, which were called senatus consultum and were official advices to a magistrate. However, in practice it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senate's advice.[72] The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict, the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also it managed Rome's civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100,000 denarii worth of land, being born of the patrician (noble aristocrats) class, and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members.[72] The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new laws, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had, in practice the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate[72] and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as Livy writes \\"levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men\\".[73] Moreover, the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes.[73][74]\\r\\nRoman stability, in Polybius assessment, was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other: a consul at war, for example, required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory, and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even: Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the Carthaginian constitution (another mixed constitution) at the time of the Hannibalic War was an effect of the latters greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy.[75] Moreover, recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense ÿ eleutheria: living as you like ÿ have fallen on stony ground, since eleutheria (which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens[76]) was anathema in the Roman eyes.[77] Romes core values included order, hierarchy, discipline, and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes, since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples.\\r\\nRome became the ruler of a great Mediterranean empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy, and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of over-mighty generals, championing the cause of either the rich or the poor, in the last century BCE.\\r\\nOver the next few hundred years, various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons, mostly to address perceived injustices, either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was Julius Caesar, where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesar's career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including Marcus Junius Brutus. In the power vacuum that followed Caesar's assassination, his friend and chief lieutenant, Marcus Antonius, and Caesar's grandnephew Octavian who also was the adopted son of Caesar, rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However, in 31 BC war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE, at the naval Battle of Actium where the fleet of Octavian under the command of Agrippa routed Antony's fleet. Thereafter, there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to, or could stand against Octavian, and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact, though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions, having military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition, though subtle, disguised, and relying on personal power over the power of offices, was complete. In that year, Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate, and in a carefully staged way, the Senate refused and titled Octavian Augustus  \\"the revered one\\". He was always careful to avoid the title of rex  \\"king\\", and instead took on the titles of princeps  \\"first citizen\\" and imperator, a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders.\\r\\nThe Roman Empire had been born. Once Octavian named Tiberius as his heir, it was clear to everyone that even the hope of a restored Republic was dead. Most likely, by the time Augustus died, no one was old enough to know a time before an Emperor ruled Rome. The Roman Republic had been changed into a despotic rgime, which, underneath a competent and strong Emperor, could achieve military supremacy, economic prosperity, and a genuine peace, but under a weak or incompetent one saw its glory tarnished by cruelty, military defeats, revolts, and civil war.\\r\\nThe Roman Empire was eventually divided between the Western Roman Empire which fell in 476 AD and the Eastern Roman Empire (also called the Byzantine Empire) which lasted until the fall of Constantinople in 1453 AD.\\r\\nMost of the procedures used by modern democracies are very old. Almost all cultures have at some time had their new leaders approved, or at least accepted, by the people; and have changed the laws only after consultation with the assembly of the people or their leaders. Such institutions existed since before the times of the Iliad or of the Odyssey, and modern democracies are often derived from or inspired by them, or what remained of them.\\r\\nNevertheless, the direct result of these institutions was not always a democracy. It was often a narrow oligarchy, as in Venice, or even an absolute monarchy, as in Florence, in the Renaissance period; but during the medieval period guild democracies did evolve.\\r\\nEarly institutions included:\\r\\nHistorian Jack Weatherford has argued that the ideas leading to the United States Constitution and democracy derived from various indigenous peoples of the Americas including the Iroquois. Weatherford claimed this democracy was founded between the years 1000ÿ1450, and lasted several hundred years, and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America.[86]\\r\\nTemple University professor of anthropology and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois Elizabeth Tooker has reviewed these claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact. The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old, but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canasatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation, and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance.[87]\\r\\nWhat little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council, and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government, and there were no elections; deceased chiefs' successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous, with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that \\"...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois\\" and that the myth that this was the case is the result of exaggerations and misunderstandings of a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt after his death in 1937.[87]\\r\\nThe Aztecs also practiced elections, but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker, not a ruler.[86]\\r\\nThe notion of a secret ballot, where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes, is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However, this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century; it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method, which is more similar to what most democracies use today, had voters put a mark in the preferred candidate's corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret, as it was traceable by a special number.\\r\\nThe stone inscriptions in a temple say that ballot elections were held in South India by a method called Kudavolai system. Kudavolai means the ballot sheet of leaf that was put secretly in a pot vessel called \\"kudam\\". The details are found inscribed on the walls of the village assembly hall. Actually, the once village-assembly hall is the present temple. The details show that the village had a secret ballot electoral system and a written Constitution, prescribing the mode of elections.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe, as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights, universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation, open list system. Likewise, the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic impact of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America.\\r\\nThe Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to America's indigenous peoples, called \\"Indians\\" in this Act. (The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S., but only if \\"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\\"; this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples.) The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States.\\r\\nWorld War II was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe, where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However, many countries of Central and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet satellite states. In Southern Europe, a number of right-wing authoritarian dictatorships (most notably in Spain and Portugal) continued to exist.\\r\\nJapan had moved towards democracy during the Taish period during the 1920s, but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar Allied occupation, with initial elections in 1946.\\r\\nWorld War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan, as it weakened, with the exception of the USSR and the United States, all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive colonies/possessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war.\\r\\nThe aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations' decision to partition the British Mandate into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage.[100][101]\\r\\nIndia became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952, India achieved the status of the world's largest liberal democracy with universal suffrage which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic; those that were formerly part of the British Empire often adopted the Westminster parliamentary system.[102] The process of decolonisation created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia, with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government.\\r\\nIn the United States of America, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act enforced the 15th Amendment. The 24th Amendment ended poll taxing by removing all tax placed upon voting, which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The Voting Rights Act also granted voting rights to all Native Americans, irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971.\\r\\nNew waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s, as a number of right-wing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later, in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, the communist states in the USSR sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies.\\r\\nMuch of Eastern Europe, Latin America, East and Southeast Asia, and several Arab, central Asian and African states, and the not-yet-state that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s.\\r\\nAn analysis by the U.S. Government funded Freedom House shows that there was not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage in the world in 1900, but that in 2000, 120 of the world's 192 nations, or 62% were such democracies. They count 25 nations, or 13% of the world's nations with \\"restricted democratic practices\\" in 1900 and 16, or 8% of the world's nations today. They counted 19 constitutional monarchies in 1900, forming 14% of the world's nations, where a constitution limited the powers of the monarch, and with some power devolved to elected legislatures, and none in the present. Other nations had, and have, various forms of non-democratic rule.[104] While the specifics may be open to debate (for example, New Zealand actually enacted universal suffrage in 1893, but is discounted due to a lack of complete sovereignty and certain restrictions on the Mori vote), the numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century.\\r\\nIn the 21st century, democracy movements have been seen across the world. In the Arab world, an unprecedented series of major protests occurred with citizens of Egypt, Tunisia, Bahrain, Yemen, Jordan, Syria and other countries across the MENA region demanding democratic rights. This revolutionary wave was given the term Tunisia Effect, as well as the Arab Spring. The Palestinian Authority also took action to address democratic rights.\\r\\nIn Iran, following a highly disputed presidential vote fraught with corruption, Iranian citizens held a major series of protests calling for change and democratic rights (see: the 2009ÿ2010 Iranian election protests and the 2011 Iranian protests). The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq led to a toppling of Saddam Hussein and a new constitution with free and open elections.[citation needed][neutrality is disputed]\\r\\nIn Asia, the country of Burma (also known as Myanmar) had long been ruled by a military junta; however, in 2011, the government changed to allow certain voting rights and released democracy-leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. However, Burma still will not allow Suu Kyi to run for election and still has major human rights problems and not full democratic rights. In Bhutan, in December 2005, the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that the first general elections would be held in 2008, and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently undergoing further changes to allow for a constitutional monarchy. In the Maldives, protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and presidential elections in 2008.\\r\\nUnder the influence of the theory of deliberative democracy, there have been several experiments since the start of the new millennium with what are called deliberative fora, places (in real life or in cyber space) where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange reasons. One type of deliberative forum is called a minpublic: a body of randomly chosen or actively selected citizens that represents the whole population. The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is known as sortition. Examples of this are citizens' assemblies and citizens' juries. Citizens' assemblies have been used in Canada (2004, 2006) and the Netherlands (2006) to debate electoral reform, and in Iceland (2009 and 2010) for broader constitutional change.\\r\\n^?i:? Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being The Republic of Plato and Politics of Aristotle, continuing with Discourses of Niccol Machiavelli. The latest, listed in the References section, include works from scholars such as J. Dunn, J. Ober, T. Buckley, J. Thorley and E. W. Robinson, who examine the origins and the reasons of Athens being the first[22][48][62][105][106][107] to developed a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy. Despite its flaws (slavery, no women's rights) it is often considered the closest to the ideal democracy and called as classical democracy. It is often compared with modern (representative) democracies.[108][109]\\r\\n^?ii:? The ancient Greeks did not have a word to use for \\"rights\\".[110]\\r\\n^?iii:? The United States of America was and is, a republic, not a direct democracy. A direct democracy can be defined as a form of government in which the people decide matters directly, with prime example the Athenian democracy. A democratic republic, is a form of government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. The delegates who wrote the Constitution were fearful of direct democracy; in the words of James Madison: \\"[D]emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\\"[111] Nevertheless, the framers recognized that the public is required to impose a check to the government, in Madison words: \\"dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government\\".[112]\\r\\nBy popular usage, however, the word \\"democracy\\" came to mean a form of government in which the government derives its power from the people and is accountable to them for the use of that power. In this sense the United States can be called a democratic republic. Many states allow for policy questions to be decided directly by the people by voting on ballot initiatives or referendums. (Initiatives originate with, or are initiated by, the people while referendums originate with, or are referred to the people by a state's legislative body.)","input":"What ideas gave birth to the first democratic nation?"},{"output":"Albany","context":"","input":"What's the state capital of new york?"},{"output":"30 June 1960","context":"","input":"When did the drc gain independence from belgium?"},{"output":"23 official perfect games","context":"Over the 140 years of Major League Baseball history, and over 210,000 games played,[1] there have been 23 official perfect games by the current definition. No pitcher has ever thrown more than one. The perfect game thrown by Don Larsen in game 5 of the 1956 World Series is the only postseason perfect game in major league history and one of only two postseason no-hitters. The first two major league perfect games, and the only two of the premodern era, were thrown in 1880, five days apart. The most recent perfect game was thrown on August 15, 2012, by Flix Hernndez of the Seattle Mariners. There were three perfect games in 2012; the only other year of the modern era in which as many as two were thrown was 2010. By contrast, there have been spans of 23 and 33 consecutive seasons in which not a single perfect game was thrown. Though two perfect-game bids have gone into extra innings, no extra-inning game has ever been completed to perfection.\\r\\nThe first two pitchers to accomplish the feat did so under rules that differed in many important respects from those of today's game: in 1880, for example, only underhand pitchingfrom a flat, marked-out box 45 feet from home platewas allowed, it took eight balls to draw a walk, and a batter was not awarded first base if hit by a pitch.[2] Lee Richmond, a left-handed pitcher for the Worcester Ruby Legs, threw the first perfect game. He played professional baseball for six years and pitched full-time for only three, finishing with a losing record. The second perfect game was thrown by John Montgomery Ward for the Providence Grays. Ward, an excellent pitcher who became an excellent position player, went on to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\\r\\nThough convention has it that the modern era of Major League Baseball begins in 1900, the essential rules of the modern game were in place by the 1893 season. That year the pitching distance was moved back to 60 feet, 6?inches, where it remains, and the pitcher's box was replaced by a rubber slab against which the pitcher was required to place his rear foot. Two other crucial rules changes had been made in recent years: In 1887, the rule awarding a hit batsman first base was instituted in the National League (this had been the rule in the American Association since 1884: first by the umpire's judgment of the impact; as of the following year, virtually automatically).[3] In 1889, the number of balls required for a walk was reduced to four.[4] Thus, from 1893 on, pitchers sought perfection in a game whose most important rules are the same as today, with two significant exceptions: counting a foul ball as a first or second strike, enforced by the National League as of 1901 and by the American League two years later, and the use of the designated hitter in American League games since the 1973 season.[5]\\r\\nDuring baseball's modern era, 21 pitchers have thrown perfect games. Most were accomplished major leaguers. Six have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame: Cy Young, Addie Joss, Jim Bunning, Sandy Koufax, Catfish Hunter, and Randy Johnson. Roy Halladay won two Cy Young Awards and was named to eight All-Star teams. David Cone won the Cy Young once and was named to five All-Star teams. Flix Hernndez is likewise a one-time Cy Young winner, as well as a six-time All-Star. Four other perfect-game throwers, Dennis Martnez, Kenny Rogers, David Wells and Mark Buehrle, each won over 200 major league games. Matt Cain, though he ended with a 104ÿ118 record, was a three-time All-Star, played a pivotal role on two World Seriesÿwinning teams, and twice finished top ten in Cy Young voting. For a few, the perfect game was the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable career. Mike Witt and Tom Browning were solid major league pitchers; Browning was a one-time All-Star with a career record of 123ÿ90, while Witt was a two-time All-Star, going 117ÿ116. Larsen, Charlie Robertson, and Len Barker were journeyman pitcherseach finished his major-league career with a losing record; Barker made one All-Star team, Larsen and Robertson none. Dallas Braden retired with a 26ÿ36 record after five seasons due to a shoulder injury. Philip Humber's perfecto was the only complete game he ever recorded, and his major league career, in which he went 16ÿ23, ended the year after he threw it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRichmond was pitching in his first full season in the big leagues after appearing in one game in 1879. He was apparently considered a good hitter, as he batted second in the lineup. His perfect game featured an unusual 9ÿ3 putout, with Worcester right fielder Lon Knight throwing out Cleveland's Bill Phillips at first.[6] The play came on one of three balls Cleveland hit out of the infield.[7] Three outs were recorded on \\"foul bounds\\": balls caught after bouncing once in foul territory (the foul bound rule was eliminated three years later). In the seventh inning, the game was delayed for seven minutes due to rain; Richmond dried the ball off with sawdust when he returned to the mound.[8] A monument marks the site of the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds where the game took place, now part of the campus of Becker College.[9] The feat was recognized as unusual: a newspaper report described it as \\"the most wonderful game on record\\".[10][11]\\r\\nMonte Ward threw his perfect game at the Grays' park in Providence, but Buffalo, by virtue of a coin toss, which was the custom under the rules at that time, was officially the \\"home\\" team, batting in the bottom of each inning. At the age of 20 years, 105 days, Ward is the youngest pitcher ever to throw a perfect game. He batted sixth in the lineup. Beginning in 1881, the year after his perfect game, Ward spent more time as a position player than a pitcher; in 1885, following an arm injury, he became a full-time infielder.[12] The five days between Ward's game and Richmond's is the shortest amount of time between major-league perfect games.\\r\\nYoung's perfect game was part of a hitless streak of 24 or 25? straight inningsdepending on whether partial innings at either end of the streak are included. In either calculation, the streak remains a record. It was also part of a streak of 45 straight innings in which Young did not give up a run, which was then a record.[13]\\r\\nJoss's was the most pressure-packed of any regular-season perfect game. With just four games left on their schedule, the Cleveland Naps were involved in a three-way pennant race with the Tigers and the White Sox, that day's opponents. Joss's counterpart, the great Ed Walsh, struck out 15 and gave up just four scattered singles. The lone, unearned run scored as a result of a botched pickoff play and a wild pitch.[15] The Naps ended the day tied with the Tigers for first, with the White Sox two games back; the Tigers would ultimately win the league by a half game over the Naps. Joss would throw a second no-hitter against the White Sox in 1910, making him and Tim Lincecum of the San Francisco Giants the only major league pitchers ever to throw two no-hitters against the same team.\\r\\nRobertson's perfect game was only his fifth appearance, and fourth start, in the big leagues. He finished his career with a 49ÿ80 record, the fewest wins of any perfect-game pitcher until Dallas Braden; Robertson's winning percentage of .380 remains the lowest of anyone who ever threw a perfect game. The Tigers, led by player-manager Ty Cobb, accused Robertson of illegally doctoring the ball with oil or grease.[16] In terms of the opposing team's ability to get on base, this is statistically the most unlikely of perfectos: the 1922 Tigers had an on-base percentage (OBP) of .373.[17]\\r\\nLarsen did not know he would pitch in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series until a few hours before gametime.[18] This was his second start of the Series; he'd lasted less than two innings in Game 2. In his perfect game, Larsen employed the style he had adopted in mid-season, working without a windup. Just one Dodgers batterPee Wee Reese, in the first inningworked a three-ball count.[19] The Dodgers had the highest season winning percentage of any team ever to lose a perfect game: .604. The image of catcher Yogi Berra leaping into Larsen's arms after the final strike is one of the most famous in baseball history.[20] The 34 years between Robertson's feat and Larsen's is the longest gap between perfect games.\\r\\nBunning's perfect game, pitched on Father's Day, was the first in the National League since Ward's 84 years before. Defying the baseball superstition that holds one should not talk about a no-hitter in progress, Bunning spoke to his teammates about the perfect game as it developed to loosen them up and relieve the pressure.[21]\\r\\nKoufax's perfect game was the first one pitched at night. It was nearly a double no-hitter, as Cubs pitcher Bob Hendley gave up only one hit, a bloop double to left-fielder Lou Johnson in the seventh inning that did not figure in the scoring. The Dodgers scored their only run in the fifth inning: Lou Johnson reached first on a walk, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third, and scored when Cubs catcher Chris Krug overthrew third base on the play. The game also set records for the fewest hits by both teams, one, and the fewest base runners by both teams, two (both Johnson). Koufax's 14 strikeouts are tied with Matt Cain for the most ever thrown by a perfect game pitcher.\\r\\nHunter, a talented batter, was also the hitting star of his perfect game. He went 3 for 4 with a double and 3 RBIs, including a bunt single that drove home the first and thus winning run in the seventh inningeasily the best offensive performance ever by a perfect game pitcher. At 22 years and 30 days old, Hunter was the youngest pitcher to throw a perfect game in the modern era. This was the first no-hitter of the Athletics' Oakland tenure, which was only 25 games old.[22]\\r\\nBarker's perfect game was the first one in which designated hitters were used. He didn't reach a three-ball count in the entire game.[23] Toronto shortstop Alfredo Griffin, who played for the losing team in this game, went on to play for the losers in the perfect games of Browning and Martnez. Also on the losing end of this game was Danny Ainge, who would play 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association. All 11 of Barker's strikeouts were swinging.[24]\\r\\nWitt's perfect game came on the last day of the 1984 season. Reggie Jackson, who drove in the only run of the game on a seventh-inning fielder's choice ground ball, was also on the winning team in Catfish Hunter's perfect game. On April 11, 1990, Witt, pitching out of the bullpen, combined with starting pitcher Mark Langston to throw a no-hitter for the California Angels.\\r\\nBrowning's perfect game, for the Cincinnati Reds against the Los Angeles Dodgers in September 1988, came against the team that eventually won that year's World Series, the only time that has happened. A two-hour, twenty-seven-minute rain delay[25] caused the game to start at approximately 10 PM. Right fielder Paul O'Neill, who played for the winning side in this game, also played for the winning side in the perfect games of Wells and Cone. The following July 4, Browning came within an inning of becoming the first pitcher to throw two perfect games, retiring the first 24 batters in a game against the Phillies before surrendering a leadoff double in the ninth.[26]\\r\\nMartnez, born in Granada, Nicaragua, was the first major league pitcher born outside of the United States to throw a perfect game. He achieved the feat for the Montreal Expos against the Los Angeles Dodgers in July 1991. Opposing pitcher Mike Morgan was perfect through five full innings, the latest the opposing starter in a perfect game has remained perfect. Two days earlier, Expos pitcher Mark Gardner no-hit the Dodgers through nine innings but lost the no-hitter in the tenth, meaning the Expos narrowly missed throwing a no-hitter and a perfect game in the same series. Martnez's catcher, Ron Hassey, had also caught Len Barker's perfect game. This was the third perfect game pitched against the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers, joining those of Larsen and Browning; the only other teams to lose more than one perfect game are the Twins (Hunter and Wells) and the Rays (Buehrle, Hernandez and Braden).\\r\\nRogers benefited from center fielder Rusty Greer's fantastic diving catch of a line drive hit by Rex Hudler, leading off the ninth inning.[27] Rogers' performance against the Angels came 10 seasons after Witt's perfect game against the Rangers. The Angels and Rangers are the only major league teams to record perfect games against each other. The home plate umpire was a minor league fill-in, Ed Bean, who was working his 29th Major League game and seventh behind the plate. Bean, who was substituting for 17-year veteran Ken Kaiser, worked only seven more MLB games following Rogers' performance.\\r\\nWells attended the same high school as Don Larsen: Point Loma High School, San Diego, California. They also both enjoyed the night life. Casey Stengel once said of Larsen, \\"The only thing he fears is sleep.\\" Wells has claimed to have been \\"half-drunk\\" and suffering from a \\"raging, skull-rattling hangover\\" during his perfect game.[28] Wells' perfect game comprised the core of a streak of 38 consecutive retired batters (May 12ÿ23, 1998), an American League record he held until 2007.\\r\\nCone's perfect game occurred on Yogi Berra Day. Don Larsen threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Berra, who had been his catcher during the 1956 World Series perfect game. As the game wore on, television cameras showed Larsen, the only perfect game pitcher to attend another perfect game. No Expo worked even a three-ball count.[29] Cone's perfect game, which took only 88 pitches, was interrupted by a 33-minute rain delay and is the only one to date in regular-season interleague play. Following teammate Wells's perfect game the previous season, this also represents the only time two successive perfect games have been thrown by the same team.\\r\\nJohnson threw his perfect game at the age of 40 years, 256 days, becoming by more than three and a half years the oldest pitcher to achieve the feat. The former holder of the mark, Cy Young, threw his at the age of 37 years, 37 days. Johnson is also the tallest perfect game pitcher at 6' 10\\", surpassing Mike Witt by three inches. Of the teams to have a perfect game thrown against them, the 2004 Braves have the second-highest OBP (.343) and are tied for the second-highest winning percentage (.593).[30] In contrast, the Diamondbacks had by far the worst season winning percentage (.315) of any team to benefit from a perfect game.[31]\\r\\nBuehrle was assisted by a dramatic ninth-inning wall-climbing catch by center fielder DeWayne Wise to rob Gabe Kapler of a home run; Wise had just entered the game as a defensive replacement before Kapler's at-bat. This was the first major league perfect game in which the pitcher and catcher were battery-mates for the first time; Ram܇n Castro had been acquired by the White Sox less than two months before.[32] This was also the first perfect game to feature a grand slam, by Josh Fields in the bottom of the second inning. Umpire Eric Cooper, who called the game, had been behind the plate for Buehrle's previous no-hitter.[33] On July 28, Buehrle followed up with another 5 2/3 perfect innings to set the major league record for consecutive batters retired at 45 (this includes the final batter he faced in his appearance before the perfect game).[34] That record was broken by Yusmeiro Petit of the San Francisco Giants in 2014[35]\\r\\nBraden's perfect game, pitched on Mother's Day, was the first complete game of his career. His grandmother attended the game and celebrated on the field with him. It was the first time a perfect game had been pitched against the team with the best record in the majors at the time; coming into the contest, the Rays were 22ÿ8.[36] The 2010 Rays are tied for the second-highest winning percentage (.593) of any team to be on the receiving end of a perfect game.[37] MLB's previous perfect game had also been thrown against the Rays, making them the second team to have successive perfect games against them (the first was the Dodgers in 1988 and 1991).[38] This game came 290 days after Buehrle's, the shortest period between modern-day perfect gamesa record which would last just three weeks until Halladay's.\\r\\nHalladay pitched the second perfect game of the 2010 season 20 days after Braden's, the shortest period between perfect games in the modern era.[39] Mark Buehrle's perfect game had been 10 months earlier, marking the first time that three perfect games occurred within a one-year span. Seven batters reached three-ball counts against Halladay.[40] Halladay nearly pitched a second perfect game in the 2010 NL Division Series against the Reds but gave up a walk to Jay Bruce. The hurler had to settle for a no-hitter and became the only perfect game pitcher to throw another no-hitter in the same season, and the fifth with two no-hitters. Halladay is the second pitcher to throw a perfect game and win the Cy Young Award in the same season; Sandy Koufax did so in 1965.[41]\\r\\nOn April 21, 2012, Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox pitched the third perfect game in White Sox history. The final out of Humber's perfect game came after a full-count check-swing third strike to Brendan Ryan on a ball that catcher A. J. Pierzynski dropped. As Ryan disputed umpire Brian Runge's decision that he had swung, Pierzynski threw the ball to first base for the final out.[42] As with Braden, Humber's perfect game was the first complete game of his career.[43] Humber's lifetime major league record of 16-23 gives him the fewest career wins of any pitcher who has thrown an MLB perfect game. The White Sox became the second franchise with three perfect games, joining the Yankees.\\r\\nOn June 13, 2012, Matt Cain of the San Francisco Giants pitched the first perfect game in Giants franchise history, the second of three in 2012, and the 22nd in MLB history. Third baseman Joaqun rias threw out Jason Castro for the final out on a chopped grounder he fielded deep behind the bag. Cain tallied 14 strikeouts, tying Sandy Koufax for the most strikeouts in a perfect game. Cain's 125 pitches are the most ever thrown in a perfect game. Cain was aided by a running catch at the wall by Melky Cabrera in the 6th and a diving catch by Gregor Blanco in the 7th. The winning Giants scored 10 runs, making this the highest-scoring perfect game. Home plate umpire Ted Barrett had also called Cone's perfect game, making him the only person to call two; having umpired at third base for Humber's game, Barrett also became just the second man, after Alfredo Griffin, to have been on the field for three perfect gameswithin two months, there would be four more.\\r\\nOn August 15, 2012, Flix Hernndez of the Seattle Mariners threw the 23rd perfect game in MLB history (and the first in August) against the Tampa Bay Rays. This was the first perfect game in Mariners history, and the franchise's fourth no-hitter.[44] Hernandez's performance was highlighted by 12 strikeouts and a career-high 26 swinging-strikes. In an on-field interview immediately following the last out, Hernandez said he had started thinking about the possibility of a perfect game in the second inning. It was the third time in the past four seasons that Tampa Bay was on the losing side of a perfect game. Four RaysEvan Longoria, Carlos Pe?a, B.J. Upton, and Ben Zobristjoined Alfredo Griffin in having played in three perfect games for the losing team; all four also participated in Buehrle's and Braden's.\\r\\nThree perfect-game pitchers had RBIs in their games: Hunter (3), Bunning (2), and Young (1). Hunter had three hits; Richmond, Ward, Bunning, Martnez, and Cain each had one. Cain is the only pitcher to score a run during a perfect game (Gregor Blanco followed him in the order and hit a home run). Barker, Witt, Rogers, Wells, Cone, Buehrle, Braden, Humber, and Hernndez did not bat in their perfect games, as the American League adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973. The latest the winning run has been scored in a perfect game is the seventh inningthis occurred in the games of Hunter (bottom), Witt (top), and Martnez (top).\\r\\nSeven perfect-game pitchers have also thrown at least one additional no-hitter: Young, Joss, Bunning, Koufax, Johnson, Buehrle, and Halladay. Witt participated in a combined no-hitter. Koufax has the most total no-hitters of any perfect-game pitcher, with four. Richmond and Robertson were rookies, though each had made a single appearance in a previous season. Although by the latter part of the twentieth century, major league games were being played predominantly at night, six of the last ten perfect games, and four of the last six, have taken place in the daytime. Since 1973, nine perfect games have been thrown with the DH rule in effect (including one interleague game held at an American League park) and only five without it.\\r\\nOf the thirty franchises that currently make up Major League Baseball, seven have never as of the end of the 2017 season been involved in a perfect game, win or lose, including three of the Original 16 franchises (the Cardinals, Pirates, and Orioles) and four of the fourteen teams that joined MLB in the expansion era (the Royals, Brewers, Padres, and Rockies). The table below shows the number of perfect games won and lost by the remaining twenty-three franchises.\\r\\nThere have been three instances in which a major league pitcher retired every player he faced over nine innings without allowing a baserunner, but, by the current definition, is not credited with a perfect game, either because there was already a baserunner when he took the mound, or because the game went into extra innings and an opposing player eventually reached base:\\r\\nFour other games in which one team failed to reach base are not official perfect games because they were called off before nine innings were played:[50]\\r\\nOn March 14, 2000, in a spring training gameby definition unofficialthe Red Sox used six pitchers to retire all 27 Toronto Blue Jays batters in a 5ÿ0 victory. The starting pitcher for the Red Sox was Pedro Martnez (see above).[54]\\r\\nOn thirteen occasions in Major League Baseball history, a perfect game has been spoiled when the batter representing what would have been the third and final out in the ninth inning reached base. Unless otherwise noted, the pitcher in question finished and won the game without allowing any more baserunners:[55]\\r\\nThere have been fifteen occasions in Major League Baseball history when a pitcheror, in one case, multiple pitchersrecorded at least 27 consecutive outs after one or more runners reached base. In four instances, the game went into extra innings and the pitcher(s) recorded more than 27 consecutive outs:\\r\\nIn the eleven other instances, the leadoff batter (or batters) reached base in the first inning, followed by 27 consecutive batters (or batters and baserunners) being retired through the end of a nine-inning game.[76] In two cases, the leadoff baserunner was retired, meaning the pitcher faced the minimum:\\r\\nThe remaining instances in which a pitcher recorded 27 consecutive outs in a game, noting how the opponent's leadoff batter (or batters) reached base:\\r\\nIn Major League Baseball play since 1893, with the essential modern rules in place, there have been ten instances when a pitcher allowed not a single baserunner through his pitching efforts over a complete game of at least nine innings, but was not awarded a perfect game because of one or more fielding errors:\\r\\nNo otherwise perfect game in major league history has ever been spoiled solely by a dropped third strike, interference, or outfield error. On August 23, 2017, the Dodgers' Rich Hill had been pitching perfectly when third baseman Logan Forsythe booted a grounder by the Pirates' first batter in the bottom of the ninth inning, Jordy Mercer. It was the first time in major league history a perfect-game bid was ruined by an error in the ninth. Hill retired the next three batters, but as the Dodgers had not supported his effort with a single run (as they failed to in the top of the first extra frame, as well), Hill took his no-hit, no-walk, noÿhit batsman game into the bottom of the 10th inning. The leadoff batter, Josh Harrison, became the first player ever to spoil a no-hitter with a walk-off homer in extra innings.[98][99]\\r\\nItalics denotes post-season perfect game","input":"How many perfect games have there been in major league history?"},{"output":"January 12, 2009","context":"Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai (English: What Is This Relationship Called?) is a Hindi language television drama that premiered on January 12, 2009 in India and airs every Monday through Friday at 9:30 pm on Star Plus.

After finding Naira, the story takes a new twist: a love triangle that forms between Kartik (Naitik's employee), Naira and Gayu (Naitik's niece). Naira and Kartik have feelings for each other but don't know that it's love. Meanwhile Gayu loves Kartik, unaware that Kartik doesn't love her back. When Kartik proposes Naira, she initially rejects him, but by the time she realizes that Gayu also loves him, she thinks of sacrificing her happiness in favor of Gayu. When Mishti reveals that Kartik loves only Naira, Kartik and Naira confess their love for each other; Gayatri understands. Kartik doesn't want to talk about his family as he hates them. Meanwhile, on Akshara's birthday, everyone goes for a veneration, but Akshara dies in a car accident. Singhanias blame Kartik for Akshara's death as Kartik was found drunk and injured at the accident site. Kartik's family shows up and supports Kartik. Later, Naira finds that Kartik is not the culprit. She proves Kartik's innocence by finding the real culprit. Kartik doesn't like his father and stepmother as he thinks they were responsible for his mother's death. Seeing Kartik's feelings towards a Singhanias, his family approves of their relationship in spite of not being much in favor of it.\\r\\nThe two families start making preparations for their wedding. Naira unexpectedly enters the Goenka house during the Tilak ceremony (which is considered to be unlucky before the wedding); Karthik's grandmother demands Naira's name to be changed as a solution. Just before the wedding, Kartik discovers the real culprit who ran Akshara over and yearns to tell Naira, but his uncle convinces him that he will tell her. He reneges and tells Naira only that Kartik is missing his mother. Finally, the wedding takes place. Currently the series is about the situations following the wedding. Just one day after the wedding, Kartik finds out about the promise Naira made to Suwarna before the wedding that she would try to convince Kartik to stay in the Goenka house forever. He immediately leaves with Naira to stay in a separate flat; Naira is not happy about it. Naira is injured by robbers, causing them to move back to the Goenka home. Naira meets the man whose brother is in jail for killing her mother and learns that Akshara's accident was caused by Mansi, Karthik's sister. The news reaches the Singhanias and they are heartbroken. The Goenkas come to apologize. Naira is initially very hurt and angry with Karthik, but she understands that it's not his fault. She takes Akshara's accident case back and forgives Mansi. On Karthik's birthday, he comes to know that Aditya tortures Keerthi and, along with Naira, decides to expose him.\\r\\nParallel with Akshara and Naitik's stories, the stories of their respective siblings also form significant story arcs in the series. Past plots have been built around the lives of Naitik's sisters Nandini and Rashmi. The series has also focused on Naitik's step-siblings. The series also paralleled the story of Akshara-Naitik with that of Varsha-Shaurya. Varsha is Akshara's best friend, and Shaurya is Akshara's older brother. The shows also focus on Naksh, Kartik, Naira, Gayatri \\"Gayu\\" Deora and Tara. Naksh is Naitik and Akshara's son; Gayu is Nikhil-Rashmi's daughter (Sameer's stepdaughter).

Over 60 million people were killed, which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistics of military wounded are available for the major combatants. The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses. World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total deaths ranging from 50 million to more than 80 million.[2] The higher figure of over 80 million includes deaths from war-related disease and famine.\\r\\n\\r\\nCivilians killed totalled 50 to 55 million, including 19 to 28 million from war-related disease and famine. Military deaths from all causes totalled 21 to 25 million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war. Statistics on the number of military wounded are included whenever available.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than half of the total number of casualties are accounted for by the dead of the Republic of China and of the Soviet Union.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of the Russian Republic in the 1990s published an estimate of USSR losses at 26.6 million,[3][4] including 8 to 9 million due to  famine and disease.[5][4][6] \\r\\nThe People's Republic of China as of 2005 estimated the number of Chinese dead at 20 million,[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total number of German dead is estimated at close to 7 million, including 5.3 million military dead and missing\\r\\nin the estimate of Rdiger Overmans of the Military History Research Office (Germany) (2000); this number includes\\r\\n900,000 men conscripted from outside of Germany's 1937 borders, in Austria, and in east-central Europe.[8][9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of Polish dead are estimated to number between 5.6 and 5.8 million according to the Institute of National Remembrance (2009).[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese government as of 2005 put the number of Japanese casualties due at 3.1 million.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nCompiling or estimating the numbers of deaths and wounded caused during wars and other violent conflicts is a controversial subject. Historians often put forward many different estimates of the numbers killed and wounded during World War II.[13] The authors of the Oxford Companion to World War II maintain that \\"casualty statistics are notoriously unreliable.\\"[14] The table below gives data on the number of dead and military wounded for each country, along with population information to show the relative impact of losses. When scholarly sources differ on the number of deaths in a country, a range of war losses is given, in order to inform readers that the death toll is disputed. Since casualty statistics are sometimes disputed the footnotes to this article present the different estimates by official governmental sources as well as historians. Military figures include battle deaths (KIA) and personnel missing in action (MIA), as well as fatalities due to accidents, disease and deaths of prisoners of war in captivity. Civilian casualties include deaths caused by strategic bombing, Holocaust victims, German war crimes, Japanese war crimes, population transfers in the Soviet Union, Allied war crimes, and deaths due to war related famine and disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sources for the casualties of the individual nations do not use the same methods, and civilian deaths due to starvation and disease make up a large proportion of the civilian deaths in China and the Soviet Union. The losses listed here are actual deaths; hypothetical losses due to a decline in births are not included with the total dead. The distinction between military and civilian casualties caused directly by warfare and collateral damage is not always clear-cut. For nations that suffered huge losses such as the Soviet Union, China, Poland, Germany, and Yugoslavia, sources can give only the total estimated population loss caused by the war and a rough estimate of the breakdown of deaths caused by military activity, crimes against humanity and war-related famine. The casualties listed here include 19 to 25 million war-related famine deaths in the USSR, China, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India that are often omitted from other compilations of World War II casualties.[15][16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe footnotes give a detailed breakdown of the casualties and their sources, including data on the number of wounded where reliable sources are available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe estimated breakdown for each Soviet republic of total war dead[13]^AY4\\r\\n\\r\\nThe source of the figures is Vadim Erlikman. Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke: spravochnik. Moscow, 2004. ISBN?5-93165-107-1. pp.?21ÿ35. Erlikman, a Russian historian,  notes that these figures are his estimates.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncluded in the figures of total war dead for each nation are victims of the Holocaust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Holocaust is the term generally used to describe the genocide of approximately six million European Jews during World War II. Martin Gilbert estimates 5.7 million (78%) of the 7.3 million Jews in German occupied Europe were Holocaust victims.[228] Estimates of Holocaust deaths range between 4.9 and 5.9 million Jews.[229]\\r\\n\\r\\nStatistical breakdown of Jewish dead:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures for the pre-war Jewish population and deaths in the table below are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust.[229] The low, high and average percentage figures for deaths of the pre-war population have been added.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1940 the Jewish population had increased to 140,000 with the inclusion of 30,000 Jewish refugees.[235] In the Netherlands 8,000 Jews in mixed marriages were not subject to deportation.[238] However, an article in the Dutch periodical De Groene Amsterdammer maintains that some Jews in mixed marriages were deported before the practice was ended by Hitler.[239]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome scholars maintain that the definition of the Holocaust should also include the other victims persecuted and killed by the Nazis.[243][244]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following figures are from The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust, the authors maintain that \\"statistics on Gypsy losses are especially unreliable and controversial. These figures (cited below) are based on necessarily rough estimates\\".[255]\\r\\n\\r\\nIncluded with total war dead are victims of Japanese war crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total war dead in the USSR includes victims of Soviet oppression.  The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased as a result of wartime overcrowding and food shortages.[288] The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal.[289] Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of people executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons.[290] The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941ÿ1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives.[291] The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps has been the subject of a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era.[292][293] Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll.[294][295] Rosefielde posits that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB.[296] Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre.[297] Rosefielde's demographic analysis puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939ÿ40 and 5,458,000 from 1941ÿ1945.[298] Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.[299]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 2009 the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) researchers estimated 150,000 Polish citizens were killed due to Soviet repression. Since the collapse of the USSR, Polish scholars have been able to do research in the Soviet archives on Polish losses during the Soviet occupation.[226] Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90,000ÿ100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.[300] In 2005 Tadeusz Piotrowski estimated the death toll in Soviet hands at 350,000.[301]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Estonian State Commission for the Examination of Repressive Policies Carried out During the Occupations put civilian deaths due to the Soviet occupation in 1940ÿ1941 at 33,900 including (7,800 deaths) of arrested people, (6,000) deportee deaths, (5,000) evacuee deaths, (1,100) people gone missing and (14,000) conscripted for forced labor.

The death toll attributable to the flight and expulsions was estimated at 2.2 million by the West German government in 1958.[455] German government reports which were released to the public in 1987 and 1989 have caused some historians in Germany to put the actual total at 500,000 to 600,000.[456] English language sources put the death toll at 2 to 3 million based on the West German government statistical analysis of the 1950s.[457][458][459][460][461][462][463][464][465][466]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe German government figures of 2.0 to 2.5 million civilian deaths due to the expulsions have been disputed by scholars since the publication of the results of the German church search service survey and the report by the German Federal Archive.[481][482][483][484][485][486][487][488]\\r\\n\\r\\nPost war increase in natural deaths\\r\\n\\r\\n^T xGreece\\r\\n\\r\\n^TA xGuam\\r\\n\\r\\n^U xHungary\\r\\n\\r\\n^V xIceland\\r\\n\\r\\n^W xIndia\\r\\n\\r\\nBengal famine of 1943\\r\\n\\r\\n^X xIran\\r\\n\\r\\n^Y xIraq\\r\\n\\r\\n^Z xIreland\\r\\n\\r\\n^AA xItaly\\r\\n\\r\\n???????????Military war dead\\r\\n???????????Confirmed dead were 159,957 (92,767 pre-armistice, 67,090 post armistice)[514]\\r\\n???????????Missing and presumed dead(including POWs) were 131,419 (111,579 pre-armistice, 19,840 post armistice)[515]\\r\\n???????????Losses by branch of service: Army 201,405; Navy 22,034; Air Force 9,096; Colonial Forces 354; Chaplains 91; Fascist militia\\r\\n???????????10,066; Paramilitary 3,252; not indicated 45,078.[516]\\r\\n???????????Military Losses by theatre of war: Italy 74,725 (37,573 post armistice); France 2,060 (1,039 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????Germany 25,430 (24,020 post armistice); Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia 49,459 (10,090 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????USSR 82,079 (3,522 post armistice); Africa 22,341 (1,565 post armistice), at sea 28,438 (5,526 post armistice);\\r\\n???????????other and unknown 6,844 (3,695 post armistice).[517]\\r\\n\\r\\n^AB xJapan\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary dead\\r\\n\\r\\n?????????????Key: Location, Army dead, Navy dead, (Total dead)\\r\\n?????????????Japan Proper: 58,100, 45,800, (103,900)\\r\\n?????????????Bonin Islands: 2,700, 12,500, (15,200)\\r\\n?????????????Okinawa: 67,900, 21,500, (89,400)\\r\\n?????????????Formosa (Taiwan): 28,500, 10,600, (39,100)\\r\\n?????????????Korea: 19,600, 6,900, (26,500)\\r\\n?????????????Sakhalin, the Aleutian, and Kuril Islands: 8,200, 3,200, (11,400)\\r\\n?????????????Manchuria: 45,900, 800, (46,700)\\r\\n?????????????China (inc.

Of these, approximately 330,000 were fatalities.[543]\\r\\n\\r\\n2-United States Strategic Bombing Survey, Medical Division (1947) The bombing of Japan killed 333,000 civilians and injured 473,000. Of this total 120,000 died and 160,000 were injured in the atomic bombings, leaving 213,000 dead and 313,000 injured by conventional bombing.[544]\\r\\n\\r\\n3-The effects of air attack on Japanese urban economy.

The exact number of dead and injured will never be known because of the confusion after the explosions. Persons unaccounted for might have been burned beyond recognition in the falling buildings, disposed of in one of the mass cremations of the first week of recovery, or driven out of the city to die or recover without any record remaining. No sure count of even the prepaid populations existed. Because of the decline in activity in the two port cities, the constant threat of incendiary raids, and the formal evacuation programs of the Government, an unknown number of the inhabitants had either drifter away from the cities or been removed according to plan. In this uncertain situation, estimates of casualties have generally ranged between 100,000 and 180,000 for Hiroshima, and between 50,000 and 100,000 for Nagasaki. The Survey believes the dead at Hiroshima to have been between 70,000 and 80,000, with an equal number injured; at Nagasaki over 35,000 dead and somewhat more than that injured seems the most plausible estimate.\\r\\n[547]\\r\\n\\r\\n^AC xKorea\\r\\n\\r\\n^AD xLatvia\\r\\n\\r\\n^AE xLithuania\\r\\n\\r\\n^AF xLuxembourg\\r\\n\\r\\n^AG xMalaya and Singapore\\r\\n\\r\\n^AH xMalta 1,493 civilians were killed and 3,734 wounded during the Siege of Malta (World War II)[109] Maltese civilians killed during the siege are also included with U.K. civilian deaths by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission\\r\\n\\r\\n^AI xMexico\\r\\n\\r\\n^AJ xMongolia\\r\\n\\r\\n^AK xNauru\\r\\n\\r\\n^AL xNepal\\r\\n\\r\\n^AM xNetherlands\\r\\n\\r\\n??????Military deaths 6,750 which included 3,900 regular Army, 2,600 Navy forces, and 250 POW in Germany.\\r\\n??????Civilian deaths of 203,250 which included 1,350 Merchant seaman, 2,800 executed, 2,500 dead in Dutch concentration camps,\\r\\n???????20,400 killed by acts of war, 104,000 Jewish Holocaust dead, 18,000 political prisoners in Germany, 27,000 workers in Germany,\\r\\n???????3,700 Dutch nationals in the German armed forces and 7,500 missing and presumed dead in Germany and 16,000 deaths\\r\\n???????in the Dutch famine of 1944.

German forces, under express orders from Hitler, fought with a special vengeance against the Serbs, who were considered Untermensch.[189] One of the worst one-day massacres during the German military occupation of Serbia was the Kragujevac massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\nC. Deliberate acts of reprisal against target populations were perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced the shooting of hostages on a large scale. At the end of the war, many Usta?e and Slovene collaborators were killed in or as a result of the Bleiburg repatriations.[189]\\r\\n\\r\\nD. The systematic extermination of large numbers of people for political, religious or racial reasons.

The Ustasa also killed most of Croatias Jews, 20,000 Gypsies and many thousands of their political enemies.\\"[673] According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum \\"The Croat authorities murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Usta?a rule; more than 30,000 Croatian Jews were killed either in Croatia or at Auschwitz-Birkenau\\".\\r\\n[674] The USHMM reports between 77,000 and 99,000 persons were killed at the Jasenovac and Stara Gradi?ka concentration camps.[675] The Jasenovac Memorial Site quotes a similar figure of between 80,000 and 100,000 victims. Stara Gradi?ka was a sub-camp of Jasenovac established for women and children.[676] The names and data for 12,790 victims at Stara Gradi?ka have been established[citation needed] Serbian sources currently claim that 700,000 persons were murdered at Jasenovac[676]\\r\\nSome 40,000 Roma were murdered.[677] Jewish victims in Yugoslavia totaled 67,122.[678]\\r\\nE.

The Interim Constitution provides for freedom to practice one's religion. The Interim Constitution also specifically denies the right to convert another person. The now-defunct constitution of 1990, which was in effect until January 15, 2007, described the country as a \\"Hindu Kingdom,\\" although it did not establish Hinduism as the state religion. The Government generally did not interfere with the practice of other religious groups, and religious tolerance was broadly observed; however, there were some restrictions.\\r\\nThe Government took positive preliminary steps with respect to religious freedom during the period covered by this report, and government policy contributed to the generally free practice of religion. The Interim Parliament, through the Interim Constitution, officially declared the country a secular state in January 2007; however, no laws specifically affecting freedom of religion were changed. Nonetheless, many believed that the declaration made it easier to practice their religion freely.\\r\\nAdherents of the country's many religious groups generally coexisted peacefully and respected places of worship, although there were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Those who converted to another religious group at times faced violence and occasionally were ostracized socially but generally did not fear to admit their affiliations in public. But overall, Nepal is viewed as a religiously harmonious place for its state of development.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country has an area of 147,181 square kilometres (56,827?sq?mi) and a population of 28 million. Hinduism is reported to be the religion of 81.34% of the population followed by Buddhism (9.04%), Islam(4.38%), Kirant (3.04%), Christianity (1.41%) practitioners of Kirant (an indigenous animist religion), 0.1 percent; and Christians, 0.6 percent. There are adherents to many other religious groups, whose proportion is small.[1] According to the chairman of the Madrassah Islamiyah Association, there are almost 2,500 madrassahs. Twenty thousand Tibetan Buddhist refugees reside in the country.\\r\\nThe Interim Constitution provides for freedom of religion and permits the practice of all religious groups; however, there are some restrictions. The Interim Parliament declared the country a secular state in the Interim Constitution in January 2007. The previous constitution described the country as a \\"Hindu Kingdom,\\" although it did not establish Hinduism as the state religion. Article 23 of the Interim Constitution protects the rights of all religious groups by guaranteeing the individual the right \\"to profess and practice his/her own religion as handed down to him/her from ancient times having due regard to traditional practices.\\" It also states \\"no person shall be entitled to convert another person from one religion to another and shall not take actions or behave in a way that would create disturbance in another's religion.\\"\\r\\nThe Interim Constitution maintains the stipulation from the 1990 constitution that no one can be discriminated against based on caste. In 2002 the previous government constituted a National Dalit Commission charged with protecting and promoting Dalit (formerly called \\"untouchable\\") rights and ensuring active participation of the Dalit community in the development of the country. Before the People's Movement in April 2006, which led to removal of the King and his government, the Commission devised legal and policy arrangements for Dalit rights, made recommendations to implement international conventions to which the country is a party, monitored and coordinated non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on efforts to uplift Dalits, and launched programs on social awareness to end social discrimination and untouchability. After the success of the People's Movement, many members of the Commission were accused of being royalist and resigned, and the Commission was unable to function. The Interim Government nominated 16 members to the Commission on June 3, 2007.\\r\\nThere are no specific laws favoring the Hindu majority, nor does the Government control the expression of Hinduism.\\r\\nAlthough there were no registration requirements for religious groups, there were legal registration requirements for NGOs. Organizations had been prohibited from registering if their names contained religious words. However, this began to change in April 2007 when the Government allowed the registration of an organization with the word \\"Bible\\" in its title. Christian, Muslim, and Jewish religious organizations claimed that, unless registered, such organizations were restricted from owning land, an important step for establishing churches, mosques, synagogues, or burial sites. An organization that provides religious services and kosher foods to Jewish adherents (generally tourists) complained that the organization was not able to legally register as a religious organization and its workers had to enter the country on business visas.\\r\\nProselytizing remained illegal. There are officially no foreign missionaries; however, for decades dozens of Christian missionary hospitals, welfare organizations, and schools have operated in the country. These organizations did not proselytize, and otherwise operated freely. Missionary schools were among the most respected institutions of secondary education; many members of the governing and business elite graduated from Jesuit high schools. Foreign workers in the missionary hospitals and schools entered the country with visas designating them as technical workers for local or international NGOs sponsoring the hospitals and schools. The Government enforced these immigration laws; if foreign workers were found to proselytize, they were expelled from the country. There were no expulsions during the reporting period. Many foreign Christian organizations had direct ties to local churches and sponsored pastors for religious training abroad.\\r\\nSome holy days, most of them Hindu, were recognized as national holidays. These were Mahashivaratri, Buddha Jayanti, Falgun Purnima, Krishna Asthami, Dasain, and Tihar.\\r\\nAlthough public schools did not teach religion, most had a statue of Saraswoti, the Hindu goddess of learning, on their grounds. Many began the day with a Hindu prayer to the goddess.\\r\\nThe Government had no formal policy on interfaith understanding. A local NGO, the Interreligious Council of Nepal, consisting of representatives of the Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and Baha'i faiths, was active in promoting peace in the country.\\r\\nTibetan Buddhists faced various restrictions on their celebrations. Local authorities generally restricted celebration of Tibetan religious festivals to private property. Police in Kathmandu prohibited Tibetans celebrating the New Year from carrying pictures of the Dalai Lama around an important Buddhist temple as part of religious ceremonies. The Government also restricted all other non-religious local Tibetan celebrations (Tibetan New Year, the Dalai Lama's birthday, and Democracy Day) to private property. On March 10, 2007, however, the Tibetan community was allowed to march freely in the street, demanding \\"freedom and justice for Tibet.\\" During the reporting period, the Government revoked the legally obtained registration of a welfare office to look after Tibetan refugees (a lawsuit was pending at the end of the reporting period) and did not allow the registration of an office to represent the Dalai Lama. The welfare office previously looked after more than 20,000 Tibetan refugees who left their homeland after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959.\\r\\nThe law prohibits converting others and proselytizing; these activities are punishable by fines, imprisonment, or, for foreigners, expulsion. However, personal conversion is allowed. Some Christian and Muslim groups were concerned that the ban on proselytizing limited the expression of non-Hindu religious belief. NGOs or individuals were allowed to file reports that individuals or organizations were proselytizing, and the Government investigated these reports.\\r\\nThere were no incidents of punishment for conversion or proselytism during the reporting period.\\r\\nMadrassahs, but not mosques, are required to register with local district administration offices (part of the Home Ministry) and supply information about their funding sources to operate; they receive no government funding. Some Muslim leaders criticized the move as discriminatory; however, the registration requirement has not been enforced. Muslims were not restricted from participating in the Hajj, although the Government did not subsidize the pilgrimage.\\r\\nThe Constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of caste; however, the caste system strongly influences society. While the Government has stressed that caste-based discrimination is illegal and temple access for \\"lower castes\\" has improved in some areas, caste discrimination was frequently practiced at Hindu temples, where Dalits were forbidden from entering by some Hindu priests.\\r\\nThere were no restrictions on the selling or possession of religious literature.\\r\\nCivil servants may take off religious holidays and celebrate them on private property without government interference.\\r\\nThere were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees.\\r\\nThere were no reports of forced religious conversion, including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States. [Edit: The meaning of this sentence is unclear.] There have been frequent reports alleging that various missionaries and foreign Christian organizations have lured poor people to change their religion by offering them jobs and money. No proof for these allegations has ever been brought forward, however; and such charges have long been leveled against Christians in south Asia. The charges have sometimes brought tensions in societies, where the newly converted are claimed to have been brainwashed.\\r\\nDuring the Nepalese Civil War, Maoist insurgents restricted religious freedom in parts of the country. There were reports of Maoists enforcing a \\"people's calendar\\" in schools that did not allow for religious holidays. Maoists sometimes demanded the use of religious facilities for their political organizations and courts.\\r\\nChristian organizations reported several cases where Maoists extorted cash from churches. In September 2004 Maoist threats prompted the temporary closing of 21 churches in Sankhuwasabha District. In October 2006 local leaders closed the Christian Kashi Gaun Church in Kashi village, Gorkha in response to pressure from local religious Lamas who were concerned that people would abandon their traditional religious beliefs. Members of the Nepal Interreligious Council visited Gorkha and met with religious and district leaders, and the government agreed to reopen the church in February 2007.\\r\\nThere were scattered reports of Maoist insurgents attacking Hindu temples and harassing Hindu priests.[citation needed] On August 21, 2006, a group of Maoists disrupted a religious function organized by a pro-Hindu organization in Bhairahawa, accusing the group of attempting to reestablish the monarchy. On September 21, 2005, a group of armed Maoists attacked and vandalized Ramchandra Temple in Muga village of Dhankuta District.\\r\\nAdherents of the country's many religious groups generally coexisted peacefully and respected places of worship. Most Hindus respected the many Buddhist shrines located throughout the country; Buddhists accorded Hindu shrines the same respect. Buddha's birthplace is an important pilgrimage site, and his birthday is a national holiday. However, some Christian groups reported that Hindu extremism increased in recent years, especially since the Parliamentary declaration of the country as a \\"secular state\\" instead of a \\"Hindu Kingdom.\\" Of particular concern were the local affiliates of the India-based Hindu political party Shiv Sena, locally known as Pashupati Sena, Shiv Sena Nepal, and Nepal Shivsena. This group was accused of playing a role in the violence in the Terai, the southern area of Nepal along the border with India, in late 2006 and early 2007.\\r\\nSome citizens were wary of proselytizing and conversion by Christians and viewed the growth of Christianity with concern. There were unconfirmed reports that Maoists suppressed religious observance in areas under their control through intimidation and harassment.\\r\\nThose who chose to convert to other religions, in particular Hindu citizens who converted to Islam or Christianity, were sometimes ostracized. They occasionally faced isolated incidents of hostility or discrimination from Hindu extremist groups. Some reportedly were forced to leave their villages. While this prejudice was not systematic, it was occasionally violent. Nevertheless, converts generally were not afraid to publicly admit their new religious affiliations.\\r\\nAlthough such discrimination is prohibited by the Constitution, the caste system strongly influenced society. Societal discrimination against members of lower castes and Dalits remained widespread despite the Government's efforts to protect the rights of disadvantaged castes. Lower castes also experienced discrimination in many other areas of life, including education, employment, and marriage. Other religious communities did not practice caste discrimination. Entrance into many Hindu temples was often restricted for persons not of South Asian ethnicity, who are unlikely to be Hindu.\\r\\nOn April 11, 2007, the Ministry of Education and Sports reported that Dalit students in Parbat District had been refused admission to the high school completion examination based on their caste. The Ministry said it would take action against those involved; however, at the end of the reporting period, the Ministry had not done so.\\r\\nOn March 4, 2007, more than 100 Dalit families were forced to leave their village in Rautahat District after a clash between a Dalit and a higher caste individual during a religious festival. The families returned to their village on March 8 after police, human rights activists, and Dalit organizations intervened.\\r\\nIn October 2006 a Dalit family in Doti District was banished from its community because family members refused to play music (their traditional role) during a Hindu religious celebration. The family took refuge in a neighboring village.\\r\\nAtheist population in Nepal is emerging. Although at a technical level, the roots of atheism were established by the Communist parties (United Mission league and Maoists), they themselves were more or less influenced by a cultural bias of favoritism to Hinduism.

According to Islamic tradition, the Mahdi's tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (Isa), who is to assist the Mahdi against the Masih ad-Dajjal (literally, the \\"false Messiah\\" or Antichrist).[6] Both Sunni and Shia Muslims agree that there is to be a Mahdi in Islamic eschatology, and that he will rule over the Muslims and establish justice; however, they differ extensively on his attributes and status. For Sunnis, the Mahdi is the Muslims' future leader who is yet to come. For most Shia Muslims, the Mahdi was born but disappeared and will remain hidden from humanity until he reappears to bring justice to the world, a doctrine known as the Occultation. For Twelver Shia, this \\"hidden Imam\\" is Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Twelfth Imam. According to Shia Quran commentators,[which?] implicit references to the Mahdi can be found in the Quran.[7]\\r\\nThroughout history, various individuals have claimed to be the Mahdi. These have included Muhammad Jaunpuri, founder of the Mahdavia sect; the Bb (Siyyid Ali Muhammad), founder of Bbism; Muhammad Ahmad, who established the Mahdist state in Sudan in the late 19th century; and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya sect.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe term mahdi does not occur in the Quran, but it is derived from the Arabic root h-d-y, commonly used to mean \\"divine guidance\\". The term al-Mahdi was employed from the beginning of Islam, but only as an honorific epithet and without any messianic significance.[5] As an honorific it has been used in some instances to describe Muhammad (by Hassan ibn Thabit), as well as Abraham, al-Hussain, and various Umayyad rulers (hudt mahdiyyn).[5] During the second civil war (680-692), after the death of Mu?awiya, the term acquired a new meaning of a ruler who would restore Islam to its perfect form and restore justice after oppression.[5] In Kufa during the rebellion in 680s, Al-Mukhtar proclaimed Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah as the Mahdi in this heightened sense. Among the Umayyads, Sulayman encouraged the belief that he was the Mahdi, and other Umayyad rulers, like Umar II, have been addressed as such in the panegyrics of Jarir and al-Farazdaq.[5]\\r\\nEarly discussions about the identity of al-Mahdi by religious scholars can be traced back to the time after the Second Fitna. These discussions developed in different directions and were influenced by traditions (hadiths) attributed to Muhammad. In Umayyad times, scholars and traditionists not only differed on which caliph or rebel leader should be designated as Mahdi, but also on whether Mahdi is a messianic figure and if signs and predictions of his time have been satisfied.[5] By the time of the Abbasid Revolution in the year 750, Mahdi was already a known concept. Evidence shows that the first Abbasid caliph As-Saffah assumed the title of \\"the Mahdi\\" for himself.[5]\\r\\nIn Shia Islam, it seems likely that the attribution of messianic qualities to the Mahdi originated from two of the groups supporting al-Hanafiyyah: southern Arabian settlers and local recent converts in Iraq. They became known as Kaysanites, and introduced what later became two key aspects of the Shia's concept of the Mahdi. The first was the notion of return of the dead, particularly of the Imams. The second was that after al-Hanafiyyah's death they believed he was, in fact, in hiding in the Razwa mountains near Medina. This later developed into the doctrine known as the Occultation.[8] The Mahdi appeared in early Shiite narratives, spread widely among Shiite groups and became dissociated from its historical figure, Muhammad al-Hanafiyyah. During the 10th century, based on these earlier beliefs, the doctrine of Mahdism was extensively expanded by Al-Kulayni, Ibrahim al-Qummi and Ibn Babawayh.[9] In particular, in the early 10th century, the doctrine of the Occultation, which declares that the Twelfth Imam did not die but was concealed by God from the eyes of men, was expounded. The Mahdi became synonymous with the \\"Hidden Imam\\" who was thought to be in occultation awaiting the time that God has ordered for his return. This return is envisaged as occurring shortly before the final Day of judgment.[4] In fact, the concept of the \\"hidden Imam\\" was attributed to several Imams in turn.[10]\\r\\nSome historians suggest that the term itself was probably introduced into Islam by southern Arabian tribes who had settled in Syria in the mid-7th century. They believed that the Mahdi would lead them back to their homeland and reestablish the Himyarite kingdom. They also believed that he would eventually conquer Constantinople.[8] It has also been suggested that the concept of the Mahdi may have been derived from messianic Judeo-Christian beliefs.[9][11] Accordingly, traditions were introduced to support certain political interests, especially Anti-Abbassid sentiments.[11][12] These traditions about the Mahdi appeared only at later times in hadith collections such as Jami' at-Tirmidhi and Sunan Abi Dawud, but are absent from the early works of Bukhari and Muslim.[3]\\r\\nThe Sunnis view the Mahdi as the follower of Muhammad and a leader of the Muslims, but, unlike most Shia Muslims, often do not believe the Mahdi has already been born,[13] but there is a group of Sunni famous scholars who mentioned that Mahdi has already been born, such as Al-Dhahabi, Ibn-Hajar, Abu al-Falah Hanbali, al-Qunduzi and so on; meanwhile, Sheikh Najm al-Din al-Askari in his book[14] named 40 of Sunni scholars who mentioned that Mahdi has already been born.[15][16][17][14][18]\\r\\nThe Mahdi is expected to arrive to rule the world and to reestablish righteousness.[8]\\r\\nSunnis in general do not consider expansive genealogies for canonical traces of the Mahdi, do not believe he has yet been born, and reject the Twelver Shi'ite principle of the Mahdi's occultation. Sunnis do, however, rely heavily on traditionally canonical collections of narrations for derivations of the Mahdi's attributes and lineage. According to Sunan Abi Dawud, one of the six canonical books of Hadith in Sunni Islam, narrated by Umm Salamah, \\"The Prophet said: The Mahdi will be of my family, of the descendants of Fatimah.\\" [19]\\r\\nIn heavy contrast with Shia Islam, Sunnis have a much more human view of the Mahdi, who they believe will be nothing less than the most rightly guided Muslim of his time. He will be rectified in a single night (which is taken to mean that the provisions for his leadership and rule will be made in a single night). According to Sunan Ibn Majah, one of the six canonical collections of Hadith, narrated by 'Ali, \\"Mahdi is one of us, the people of the Household. Allah will rectify him in a single night.\\" [20] Whereas much of the Shi'ite belief ascribes divine facultiesin some circles of Shi'ite Islam it is even believed that the Mahdi can mentally control the wind and vegetation by God's permissionand transcendent status to the Mahdi, Sunnis believe he will be altogether human but will have sagacity, especially as it pertains to leading other people and ruling a nation. Sunnis believe he will rise and be recognized by his continued philanthropy, charity, piety, facial features, name, and sense of justice, not through direct divine intervention. It is not unreasonable to suspect, based on these narrations, that the Mahdi may not be known to the people immediately, even after being born and living for quite some time without the title of Mahdi (hence, being rectified by God). According to Sunan Abi Dawud, \\"The Prophet said: The Mahdi will be of my stock, and will have a broad forehead [and] a prominent nose. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny, and he will rule for seven years.\\" [21]\\r\\nOther canonical narrations describe the state of the Muslims during the Mahdi's reign, and a few of his other characteristics, including a hint of his name, which is presumed to be Muhammad. According to Jami al-Tirmidhi, one of the six canonical collections of Hadith, the Prophet is reported to have said, \\"The world shall not pass away until a man from the people of my family rules the Arabs whose name agrees with my name.\\" [22] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, \\"Even if there was only one day left of this world, Allah would make it last until a man from my household took possession of (the mountain of) Dailam and Constantinople.\\" [23] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, \\"We, the sons of 'Abdul-Muttalib, will be leaders of the people of Paradise: Myself, Hamzah. 'Ali, Ja'far, Hasan, Husain and Mahdi.\\" [24] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, \\"The Mahdi will be among my nation. If he lives for a short period, it will be seven, and if he lives for a long period, it will be nine, during which my nation will enjoy a time of ease such as it has never enjoyed. The land will bring forth its yield and will not hold back anything, and wealth at that time will be piled up. A man will stand up and say: 'O Mahdi, give me!' He will say: 'Take.'\\" [25] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, \\"Three will fight one another for your treasure, each one of them the son of a caliph, but none of them will gain it. Then the black banners will come from the east, and they will kill you in an unprecedented manner.\\" Then he mentioned something that I do not remember, then he said: \\"When you see them, then pledge your allegiance to them even if you have to crawl over the snow, for that is the caliph of Allah, Mahdi.\\" [26]\\r\\nBoth Shi'ite and Sunni schools of thought concur that there is to be a Mahdi in Islamic eschatology, and that he will rule over the Muslims and establish justice; however, they differ extensively on his attributes and status.\\r\\nThe Mahdi is frequently mentioned in Sunni hadith as establishing the caliphate. Among Sunnis, some believe the Mahdi will be an ordinary man. The following Sunni hadith make references to the Mahdi:\\r\\nHis name will be my name, and his father's name my father's name[8]\\r\\nEven if the entire duration of the world's existence has already been exhausted and only one day is left before Doomsday, Allah will expand that day to such length of time as to accommodate the kingdom of a person from my Ahlul-Bayt who will be called by my name. He will fill out the earth with peace and justice as it will have been full of injustice and tyranny (by then).[27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35]\\r\\nHis [the Mahdi's] aim is to establish a moral system from which all superstitious faiths have been eliminated. In the same way that students enter Islam, so unbelievers will come to believe.[36]\\r\\nWhen the Mahdi appears, Allah will cause such power of vision and hearing to be manifested in believers that the Mahdi will call to the whole world from where he is, with no postman involved, and they will hear and even see him.[37]\\r\\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \\"He is one of us\\".[38]\\r\\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \\"The Mahdi is of my lineage, with a high forehead and a long, thin, curved nose. He will fill the earth with fairness and justice as it was filled with oppression and injustice, and he will rule for seven years.[39]\\r\\nThe Messenger of Allah said: \\"At the end of the time of my ummah, the Mahdi will appear. Allah will grant him rain, the earth will bring forth its fruits, he will give a lot of money, cattle will increase and the ummah will become great. He will rule for seven or eight years.[40]\\r\\nThe Mahdi is from my Ummah; he will be born and live to rule five or seven or nine years. (If) one goes to him and says, \\"Give me (a charity)\\", he will fill one's garment with what one needs.\\r\\nThe face of the Mahdi shall shine upon the surface of the Moon.\\r\\nHis forehead will be broad and his nose will be high, his face will shine like a star and he will have a black spot on his left cheek.[41]\\r\\nIn Dhu al-Qi'dah (Islamic month), there will be fight among the tribes, Muslim pilgrims will be looted and there will be a battle in Mina in which many people will be slain and blood will flow until it runs over the Jamaratul Aqba (one of the three stone pillars at Mina). The man they seek will flee and will be found between the Rukn (a corner of the Kaaba containing the Black Stone) and the Maqam of Prophet Abraham (near Ka'ba). He will be forced to accept people's Bay'ah (being chosen as a Leader/Caliph). The number of those offering Bay'ah will be the same as the number of the people of Badr (Muslim fighters who participated in the Battle of Badr at time of Prophet Mohammad). Then, the dweller of Heaven and the dweller of the Earth will be pleased with him.[42]\\r\\nA typical modernist in his views on the Mahdi, Abul Ala Maududi (1903ÿ1979), the Pakistani Islamic revivalist, stated that the Mahdi will be a modern Islamic reformer/statesman, who will unite the Ummah and revolutionise the world according to the ideology of Islam, but will never claim to be the Mahdi, instead receiving posthumous recognition as such.[43]\\r\\nSome Islamic scholars reject Mahdi doctrine, including Allama Tamanna Imadi (1888ÿ1972),[44] Allama Habibur Rahman Kandhalvi,[45] and Javed Ahmad Ghamidi (1951- ).[46][47]\\r\\nJaved Ahmad Ghamidi writes in his Mizan:\\r\\nBesides these, the coming of the Mahdi and that of Jesus from the heavens are also regarded as signs of the Day of Judgment. I have not mentioned them. The reason is that the narratives of the coming of the Mahdi do not conform to the standards of hadith criticism set forth by the muhaddithun. Some of them are weak and some fabricated; no doubt, some narratives, which are acceptable with regard to their chain of narration, inform us of the coming of a generous caliph; (Muslim, No: 7318) however, if they are deeply deliberated upon, it becomes evident that the caliph they refer to is Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz who was the last caliph from a Sunni standpoint. This prediction of the Prophet has thus materialized in his personality, word for word. One need not wait for any other Mahdi now.\\r\\nAhmed Hulusi interpreted the Mahdi as a part of the inner self. Therefore, the Mahdi awakes in a person to defeat the inner Dajjal. The Mahdi stands for attaining selflessness and realizing a person's own existence as a part of God.[48]\\r\\nTwelver Shi'ites (as the main branch of Shia, which consists of 85% of all Shia Muslims[49][50][51][52]) claim that their twelfth Imam, Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Askari, who went into occultation around 256/873-874, is the promised Mahdi, who will appear before the day of Judgement, to restore justice and equity on earth.[53] In Shia Islam, the Mahdi is associated with the belief in the Occultation, that the Mahdi is a \\"hidden Imam\\" who has already been born and who will one day return alongside Jesus to fill the world with justice.[13] The promised Mahdi, who is usually mentioned in Shia Islam by his title of Imam-Al-Asr (the Imam of the \\"Period\\") and Sahib al-Zaman (the Lord of the Age), is the son of the eleventh Imam. His name is the same as that of the Prophet of Islam. According to Shia Islam, Mahdi was born in Samarra in 868 and until 872 when his father was martyred, lived under his father's care and tutelage. He was hidden from public view and only a few of the elite among the Shiah were able to meet him.[54]\\r\\nBy Shi'ism, belief in the messianic Imam is not a part of their creed but it is the foundation of their creed.[53] Shias believe that after the martyrdom of his father he became Imam and by Divine Command went into occultation (ghaybat). Thereafter he appeared only to his deputies (naib) and even then only in exceptional circumstances. [54]\\r\\nIn Shias' perspective, Mahdi chose as a special deputy for a time Uthman ibn Said Umari, one of the companions of his father and grandfather who was his con?dant and trusted friend. Through his deputy Mahdi would answer the demands and questions of the Shias. After Uthman ibn Said, his son Muhammad ibn Uthman Umari was appointed the deputy of him. After the death of Muhammad ibn Uthman, Abul Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh Nawbakhti was the special deputy, and after his death Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari was chosen for this task.[54]\\r\\nA few days before the death of Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari in 939 an order was issued by Mahdi stating that in six days Ali ibn Muhammad Simmari would die. Henceforth the special deputation of the Imam would come to an end and the major occultation (ghaybat-i kubra) would begin and would continue until the day God grants permission to the Imam to manifest himself.[54]\\r\\nIn Shia view, the occultation of Mahdi is, therefore, divided into two parts: the ?rst, the minor occultation (ghaybat-i sughra) which began in 872 and ended in 939, lasting about seventy years; the second, the major occultation which commenced in 939 and will continue as long as God wills it. In a hadith upon whose authenticity Shia and Sunni agree, Muhammad has said, \\"If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household. His name will be the same as my name. He will ?ll the earth with equity and justice as it was ?lled with oppression and tyranny.\\" [54][55]\\r\\nShias believe that the arrival of the Mahdi will be signalled by the following portents:[4]\\r\\nShia traditions also state that the Mahdi be \\"a young man of medium stature with a handsome face\\" and black hair and beard. \\"He will not come in an odd year [...] will appear in Mecca between the corner of the Kaaba and the station of Abraham and people will witness him there.[4]\\r\\nThe Mahdi is the protector of the knowledge, the heir to the knowledge of all the prophets, and is aware of all things.[56][57]\\r\\nThe dominion (authority) of the Mahdi is one of the proofs that God has created all things; these are so numerous that his [the Mahdi's] proofs will overcome (will be influential, will be dominant) everyone and nobody will have any counter-proposition against him.[58]\\r\\nPeople will flee from him [the Mahdi] as sheep flee from the shepherd. Later, people will begin to look for a purifier. But since they can find none to help them but him, they will begin to run to him.[59]\\r\\nWhen matters are entrusted to competent [the Mahdi], Almighty God will raise the lowest part of the world for him, and lower the highest places. So much that he will see the whole world as if in the palm of his hand. Which of you cannot see even a single hair in the palm of his hand?[60]\\r\\nIn the time of the Mahdi, a Muslim in the East will be able to see his Muslim brother in the West, and he in the West will see him in the East.[61]\\r\\nThe Master of the Command was named as the Mahdi because he will dig out the Torah and other heavenly books from the cave in Antioch. He will judge among the people of the Torah according to the Torah; among the people of the Gospel according to the Gospel; among the people of the Psalms in accordance with the Psalms; among the people of the Qur'an in accordance with the Qur'an.\\r\\nAbu Bashir says: When I asked Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, \\"O son of the Messenger of God! Who is the Mahdi (qa'im) of your clan (ahl al-bayt)?\\", he replied: \\"The Mahdi will conquer the world; at that time the world will be illuminated by the light of God, and everywhere in which those other than God are worshipped will become places where God is worshiped; and even if the polytheists do not wish it, the only faith on that day will be the religion of God.[62]\\r\\nSadir al-Sayrafi says: I heard from Imam Abu Abdullah Ja'far al-Sadiq that: Our modest Imam, to whom this occultation belongs [the Mahdi], who is deprived of and denied his rights, will move among them and wander through their markets and walk where they walk, but they will not recognize him ().[63]\\r\\nAbu Bashir says: I heard Imam Muhammad al-Baqr say: \\"He said: When the Mahdi appears he will follow in the path of the Messenger of God. Only he [the Mahdi] can explain the works of the Messenger of God.[64]\\r\\nThe face of the Mahdi shall shine upon the surface of the Moon.[65]\\r\\nAccording to Twelevers, the main goal of the Mahdi will be to establish an Islamic state and to apply Islamic laws that were revealed to Muhammad.[66] The Mahdi is believed to be the Twelfth Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi.[67] they believe that the Twelfth Imam will return from the Occultation as the Mahdi with \\"a company of his chosen ones,\\" and his enemies will be led by Antichrist and the Sufyani. The two armies will fight \\"one final apocalyptic battle\\" where the Mahdi and his forces will prevail over evil. After the Mahdi has ruled Earth for a number of years, Isa will return.[4]\\r\\nShia strongly believe that the prolonged lifespan of Mahdi is thoroughly justified according to rational, Quranic, traditional, research-based and historical accounts. In this regard, some reasons will be expressed: 1-The Quran includes verses that can show the Shia claim regarding the possibility of the prolonged lifespan of the Mahdi such as the fourteenth verse of chapter Al-Ankabut (29). In this verse, Prophet Noah invited his people to God for 950 years. Some Hadiths say that he lived for 2500 years.[68] Twenty-fifth verse of chapter Al-Kahf is the other one. This verse states that the People of the Cave lived for 309 years asleep in the cave. 2-Narrations from Imams allege the feasibility of a long-lasting life span in humans. For instance, Shia sources have been emphasized the longevity of Khizr; besides, the meeting of Ali and Khizr is stated in Shia sources.[69]\\r\\nAccording to some interpretations of the Quran, throughout the history of human life, the earth has never been without divine leaders and Allah has selected an appropriate man for every nation. There are two types of Quranic verses which one can find out the existence of Imam Mahdi and advent of him. 1-Some verses show the necessity of the existence of Imam such as You are only a warner, and there is a guide for every people (13:7). Imam Sadiq has said in this regard: there is a leader from our family at any time and guides people to the straight path.[70] 2-Some verses give good news that the government of believers will be created; such as this verse: Certainly We wrote in the Psalms, after the Torah:\\" Indeed My righteous servants shall inherit the earth.\\" [71]\\r\\nIn 648/1250-1 the Syrian Shafi'i author Mu?ammad b. Yusuf al-Gandji al-Kurashi wrote K. al-Bayan fi akhbar sahib al-zaman in proving the Mahdiship of the Twelfth Imam using Sunni traditions. In 650/1252 Kamalal-Din Mu?ammad b. Talha al-?Adawi al-Nisibini, a Shafi'i scholar composed his Ma?alib al-su?ul fi mana?ib al al-rasul answering Sunni objections to the belief that the Twelfth Imm was the Mahdi. The Sibt ibn al-Jawzi wrote Tadhkirat khawass al-umma bi-dhikr khasa?is al-a?imma collecting hadiths from Sunni sources about the virtues of ?Ali and his descendants, and at the end affirmed that the Twelfth Imam was the Expected Qa?im and Mahdi. Among Sufi circles Abu Bakr al-Bayha?ؐ (d. 458/1066) had noted that some Sufi gnostics (djama?a min ahl al-kashf) agreed with the Imami doctrine about the identity of the Mahdi and his ghayba (occultation). The Persian Sufi Sadr al-Din Ibrahim al-Hammuyi (late 7th/13th century) supported Imami doctrine on the Mahdi in his Fara?id al-simtayn. The Egyptian Sufi al-Sha?rani, while generally showing no sympathy for Shi?ism affirmed in his al-Yawa?it wa l-dj?awahir (written in 958/1551) that the Mahdi was a son of Imam al-Hasan al-?Askari born in the year 255/869 and would remain alive until his meeting with Jesus.[72]\\r\\nFor the Sevener Ism?ؐlؐ, the Immate ended with Isma'il ibn Ja'far, whose son Muhammad ibn Ismail was the expected Mahdi that Ja'far al-Sadiq had preached about. However, at this point the Ism?ؐlؐ Imms according to the Nizari and Mustaali found areas where they would be able to be safe from the recently founded Abbasid Caliphate, which had defeated and seized control from the Umayyads in 750 AD.[73]\\r\\nIn Ahmadiyya belief the terms \\"Messiah\\" and \\"Mahdi\\" are synonymous terms for one and the same person. Like the term Messiah which, among other meanings, in essence means being anointed by God or appointed by God the term \\"Mahdi\\" means guided by God, thus both imply a direct ordination or commissioning and a spiritual nurturing by God of a divinely chosen individual. According to Ahmadiyya thought the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam, the Messiah and Mahdi, were in fact to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets.[74] The prophecies concerning the Mahdi or the Second Coming of Jesus are seen by Ahmadis as metaphorical and subject to interpretation. It is argued that one was to be born and rise within the dispensation of Muhammad, who by virtue of his similarity and affinity with Jesus, and the similarity in nature, temperament and disposition of the people of Jesus' time and the people of the time of the promised one (the Mahdi) is called by the same name.[75]\\r\\nThese prophecies according to Ahmadi Muslims have been fulfilled in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835ÿ1908), the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement, who claimed to be divinely appointed as the second coming of Jesus and the Mahdi in 1891 around the same point in time after Muhammad as Jesus had appeared after Moses (thirteen centuries). Contrary to mainstream Islam, the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven, but claim that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus, the promised Messiah and Mahdi.[76][77]\\r\\nThe Mahdavia sect, founded by Muhammad Jaunpuri commonly known as Nur Pak claimed to be the Mahdi in Mecca, in front of Kaaba (between rukn and maqam) in the Hijri year 901(10th Hijri), and is revered as such by Mahdavia. He was born in Jaunpur, traveled throughout India, Arabia and Khorasan, where he died at the town of Farah, Afghanistan at the age of 63. The Mahdavi regard Jaunpuri as the Imam Mahdi, the Caliph of Allah and the second most important figure after the Islamic prophet Muhammad.\\r\\nAl Mu?ammad Shrz (20 October 1819 ÿ 9 July 1850), claimed to be the Mahdi on 24 May 1844, taking the name Bb (Arabic: ????? / English: Gate) and thereby founding the religion of Bbism. He was later executed by firing squad in the town of Tabriz. His remains are buried in a tomb at the Bah' World Centre in Haifa, Israel.\\r\\nThe Bb is considered the forerunner of Bah'u'llh (Arabic: ???? ?????? / English: Glory of God), and both are considered as Manifestation of God. The declaration by the Bb to be the Mahdi is considered by Baha'is to be the beginning of the Bah' calendar.[78]\\r\\nIn Dasam Granth, the Sikh scripture attributed to the tenth Sikh guru Guru Gobind Singh prophesizes the Mahdi (referred to as \\"Mahdi Meer\\") to be born for a purpose of defeating Kalki. As Kalki becomes egoistic and begins referring to himself as the Almighty, the powerful Mahdi will slay him and rule the world and when Mahdi Meer walks the same line as the Kalki Avtaar, i.e., equating himself with God, then he also will die from an insect created by God, which will enter into his body and will disease him.\\r\\nThe following individuals (or their adherents on their behalf) have claimed to be the Mahdi:","input":"Who is al mahdi and what will he accomplish?"},{"output":"Doctor of Medicine (MD","context":"","input":"What degree do you get out of medical school?"},{"output":"June 6, 1946","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States:\\r\\n\\r\\nCanada:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America; composed of 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). It is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. The NBA is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB),[2] which is recognized by FIBA (also known as the International Basketball Federation) as the national governing body for basketball in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. NBA players are the world's best paid athletes by average annual salary per player.[3][4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league was founded in New York City on June 6, 1946, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA).[1][5] The league adopted the name National Basketball Association on August 3, 1949, after merging with the competing National Basketball League (NBL). The league's several international as well as individual team offices are directed out of its head offices located in the Olympic Tower at 645 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. NBA Entertainment and NBA TV studios are directed out of offices located in Secaucus, New Jersey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Basketball Association of America was founded in 1946 by owners of the major ice hockey arenas in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States and Canada. On November 1, 1946, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens, in a game the NBA now refers to as the first played game in NBA history.[6] The first basket was made by Ossie Schectman of the Knickerbockers. Although there had been earlier attempts at professional basketball leagues, including the American Basketball League and the NBL, the BAA was the first league to attempt to play primarily in large arenas in major cities. During its early years, the quality of play in the BAA was not significantly better than in competing leagues or among leading independent clubs such as the Harlem Globetrotters. For instance, the 1948 ABL finalist Baltimore Bullets moved to the BAA and won that league's 1948 title, and the 1948 NBL champion Minneapolis Lakers won the 1949 BAA title. Prior to the 1948ÿ49 season, however, NBL teams from Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester jumped to the BAA, which established the BAA as the league of choice for collegians looking to turn professional.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn August 3, 1949, the remaining NBL teamsÿSyracuse, Anderson, Tri-Cities, Sheboygan, Denver, and Waterlooÿmerged into the BAA. In deference to the merger and to avoid possible legal complications, the league name was changed to the present National Basketball Association, even though the merged league retained the BAA's governing body, including Podoloff.[7] To this day, the NBA claims the BAA's history as its own. It now reckons the arrival of the NBL teams as an expansion, not a merger, and does not recognize NBL records and statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new league had seventeen franchises located in a mix of large and small cities,[8] as well as large arenas and smaller gymnasiums and armories. In 1950, the NBA consolidated to eleven franchises, a process that continued until 1953ÿ54, when the league reached its smallest size of eight franchises: the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Philadelphia Warriors, Minneapolis Lakers, Rochester Royals, Fort Wayne Pistons, Tri-Cities Blackhawks, and Syracuse Nationals, all of which remain in the league today. The process of contraction saw the league's smaller-city franchises move to larger cities. The Hawks shifted from the Tri-Cities to Milwaukee in 1951, and then to St. Louis in 1955. The Rochester Royals moved from Rochester, New York, to Cincinnati in 1957 and the Pistons relocated from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to Detroit in 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nJapanese-American Wataru Misaka broke the NBA color barrier in the 1947ÿ48 season when he played for the New York Knicks. He remained the only non-white player in league history prior to the first African-American, Harold Hunter, signing with the Washington Capitols in 1950.[9][10] Hunter was cut from the team during training camp,[9][11] but several African-American players did play in the league later that year, including Chuck Cooper with the Celtics, Nathaniel \\"Sweetwater\\" Clifton with the Knicks, and Earl Lloyd with the Washington Capitols. During this period, the Minneapolis Lakers, led by center George Mikan, won five NBA Championships and established themselves as the league's first dynasty.[12] To encourage shooting and discourage stalling, the league introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954.[13] If a team does not attempt to score a field goal (or the ball fails to make contact with the rim) within 24 seconds of obtaining the ball, play is stopped and the ball given to its opponent.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1957, rookie center Bill Russell joined the Boston Celtics, which already featured guard Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, and went on to lead the club to eleven NBA titles in thirteen seasons. Center Wilt Chamberlain entered the league with the Warriors in 1959 and became a dominant individual star of the 1960s, setting new single game records in scoring (100) and rebounding (55). Russell's rivalry with Chamberlain became one of the greatest rivalries in the history of American team sports.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1960s were dominated by the Celtics. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy and coach Red Auerbach, Boston won eight straight championships in the NBA from 1959 to 1966. This championship streak is the longest in NBA history. They did not win the title in 1966ÿ67, but regained it in the 1967ÿ68 season and repeated in 1969. The domination totaled nine of the ten championship banners of the 1960s.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough this period, the NBA continued to evolve with the shift of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Warriors to San Francisco, the Syracuse Nationals to Philadelphia to become the Philadelphia 76ers, and the St. Louis Hawks moving to Atlanta, as well as the addition of its first expansion franchises. The Chicago Packers (now Washington Wizards) became the ninth NBA team in 1961. From 1966 to 1968, the league expanded from 9 to 14 teams, introducing the Chicago Bulls, Seattle SuperSonics (now Oklahoma City Thunder), San Diego Rockets (who relocated to Houston four years later), Milwaukee Bucks, and Phoenix Suns.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1967, the league faced a new external threat with the formation of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The leagues engaged in a bidding war. The NBA landed the most important college star of the era, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor). However, the NBA's leading scorer, Rick Barry, jumped to the ABA, as did four veteran refereesNorm Drucker, Earl Strom, John Vanak, and Joe Gushue.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1969, Alan Siegel, who oversaw the design of Jerry Dior's Major League Baseball logo a year prior, created the modern NBA logo inspired by the MLB's. It incorporates the silhouette of the legendary Jerry West based on a photo by Wen Roberts, although NBA officials denied a particular player as being its influence because, according to Siegel, \\"They want to institutionalize it rather than individualize it. It's become such a ubiquitous, classic symbol and focal point of their identity and their licensing program that they don't necessarily want to identify it with one player.\\" The iconic logo debuted in 1971 (with a small change to the typeface on the NBA wordmark in 2017) and would remain a fixture of the NBA brand.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ABA succeeded in signing a number of major stars in the 1970s, including Julius Erving of the Virginia Squires, in part because it allowed teams to sign college undergraduates. The NBA expanded rapidly during this period, one purpose being to tie up the most viable cities. From 1966 to 1974, the NBA grew from nine franchises to 18. In 1970, the Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Buffalo Braves (now the Los Angeles Clippers) all made their debuts expanding the league to 17.[18] The New Orleans Jazz (now in Utah) came aboard in 1974 bringing the total to 18. Following the 1976 season, the leagues reached a settlement that provided for the addition of four ABA franchises to the NBA, raising the number of franchises in the league at that time to 22. The franchises added were the San Antonio Spurs, Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, and New York Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets). Some of the biggest stars of this era were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Rick Barry, Dave Cowens, Julius Erving, Elvin Hayes, Walt Frazier, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore, George Gervin, Dan Issel, and Pete Maravich. The end of the decade, however, saw declining TV ratings, low attendance and drug-related player issues ÿ both perceived and real ÿ that threatened to derail the league.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league added the ABA's innovative three-point field goal beginning in 1979 to open up the game. That same year, rookies Larry Bird and Magic Johnson joined the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers respectively, initiating a period of significant growth in fan interest in the NBA throughout the country and the world. The two had faced each other in the 1979 NCAA Division I Basketball Championship Game, and they later played against each other in three NBA Finals (1984, 1985, and 1987, featuring 11 players and coaches who would later be inducted to the Basketball Hall of Fame). Like the 1960s, when the Celtics and Lakers faced each other in six NBA Finals, the two teams again dominated the NBA. In the 10 seasons of the 1980s, Johnson led the Lakers to five titles in eight Finals while Bird led the Celtics to three titles in five Finals. Also in the early 1980s, the NBA added one more expansion franchise, the Dallas Mavericks, bringing the total to 23 teams. Later on, Larry Bird won the first three three-point shooting contests. Former league commissioner David Stern, who took office on February 1, 1984, oversaw the expansion and growth of the NBA to a global commodity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael Jordan entered the league in 1984 with the Chicago Bulls, providing an even more popular star to support growing interest in the league. This resulted in more cities demanding teams of their own. In 1988 and 1989, four cities got their wishes as the Charlotte Hornets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, and Minnesota Timberwolves made their NBA debuts, bringing the total to 27 teams. The Detroit Pistons won the back-to-back in 1989 and 1990, led by coach Chuck Daly and guard Isiah Thomas. Jordan and Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to two three-peats in eight years during the 1991ÿ98 seasons. Hakeem Olajuwon won back-to-back titles with the Houston Rockets in 1994 and 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1992 Olympic basketball Dream Team, the first to use current NBA stars, featured Michael Jordan as the anchor, along with Bird, Johnson, David Robinson, Patrick Ewing, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler, Karl Malone, John Stockton, Chris Mullin, Charles Barkley, and star NCAA amateur Christian Laettner. The team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, while 11 of the 12 players on the roster (all but Laettner) and three of the four coaches have been elected to the Hall of Fame as individuals.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1995, the NBA expanded to Canada with the addition of the Vancouver Grizzlies and the Toronto Raptors. In 2001, the Vancouver Grizzlies relocated to Memphis, which left the Raptors as the only Canadian team in the NBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, the NBA created a women's league, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1998, the NBA owners began a lockout which lasted 191 days and was settled on January 18, 1999. As a result of this lockout the 1998ÿ99 NBA season was reduced from 82 to 50 games (61% of a normal season), and the All-Star Game was cancelled. The San Antonio Spurs won their first championship, and first by a former ABA team, by beating the New York Knicks, who were the first, and are the only, eighth seed to ever make it to the NBA Finals.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the breakup of the Chicago Bulls championship roster in the summer of 1998, the Western Conference has dominated. The Los Angeles Lakers of coach Phil Jackson and the San Antonio Spurs of Gregg Popovich combined to make 13 Finals in 16 seasons, with 10 titles. Tim Duncan and David Robinson won the 1999 championship with the Spurs, and Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant started the 2000s with three consecutive championships for the Lakers. The Spurs reclaimed the title in 2003 against the Nets. In 2004, the Lakers returned to the Finals, only to lose in five games to the Detroit Pistons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Spurs took home the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in 2005, the 2006 Finals featured two franchises making their inaugural Finals appearances. The Miami Heat, led by their star shooting guard, Dwyane Wade, and Shaquille O'Neal, who had been traded from the Lakers during summer 2004, won the series over the Dallas Mavericks in six after losing the first two games. The Lakers/Spurs dominance continued in 2007 with a four-game sweep by the Spurs over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were led by LeBron James. The 2008 Finals saw a rematch of the league's highest profile rivalry, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, with the Celtics winning, for their 17th championship, thanks to their new big three of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Kevin Garnett.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2009, Kobe Bryant and the Lakers returned to the Finals, this time defeating the Dwight Howard-led Orlando Magic. Bryant won his first Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award in his 13th season after leading the Lakers to their first NBA championship since the departure of Shaquille O'Neal.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2010 NBA All-Star Game was held at Cowboys Stadium in front of the largest crowd ever, 108,713.[20] At the end of that season, the Celtics and the Lakers renewed their rivalry from 2008 when they met again in the NBA Finals for a record 12th time. The Lakers won the title by winning Game 7, 83ÿ79.[21] Before the start of the 2010ÿ11 season the NBA had an exciting summer with one of the most anticipated free agent classes of all time. Two of which signed, and one resigned, with the Miami Heat, leading to a season that was heavily centered on their eventual success or failure at taking home the championship. The Heat, led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, did in fact make the Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, in a rematch for the franchises of the 2006 Finals. The Mavericks, led by Dirk Nowitzki (the eventual NBA Finals MVP), took the series in six games. This was the Mavericks' first title. Veterans Shawn Marion, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, and Peja Stojakovi? celebrated their first NBA championship.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 1, 2011, at 12:01 am, the NBA announced another lockout.[22] After the first few weeks of the season were canceled, the players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement on December 8, 2011, setting up a shortened 66-game season.[23] Following the shortened season, the Miami Heat made a return to the Finals with the trio of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh against Oklahoma City Thunder's Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden. The Heat went on to defeat the Thunder in five games, capturing their second NBA title in six years. Their success would continue into the following season, which concluded with their victory over the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 NBA Finals. The two teams would meet for a rematch in the following year's Finals, where the Spurs defeated the Heat in five games. Off the court, commissioner David Stern retired on February 1, 2014, exactly 30 years to the day from taking office. He was succeeded by his deputy, Adam Silver.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the 2014 Finals, LeBron James announced that he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. James led the Cavaliers to their second Finals appearance, where they lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. The following year, in a rematch, the 2016 NBA Finals concluded with the Cavaliers defeating the Warriors in seven games to win their first NBA Championship. The dominance of those two teams continued in 2017, when the Warriors, having signed Kevin Durant as a free agent, took the third straight Finals matchup between the two teams in five games, with Durant named Finals MVP, and again in 2018 when they went to a fourth straight Finals matchup.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra?en Petrovi? (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Since 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009, in the EuroLeague American Tour. The 2013ÿ14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[24]. The beginning of the 2017-18 season saw a record 108 international players representing 42 different countries marking 4 consecutive years of at least 100 international players and each team having at least one international player[25]. In 2018, the Phoenix Suns hired Serbian coach Igor Koko?kov as their new head coach, replacing Canadian interim coach Jay Triano, making Koko?kov the first European coach to become a head coach for a team in the NBA.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2001, an affiliated minor league, the National Basketball Development League, now called the NBA G League, was created.[26] Before the league was started, there were strong rumors that the NBA would purchase the Continental Basketball Association, and call it its developmental league.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo years after the Hornets' relocation to New Orleans, the NBA returned to North Carolina, as the Charlotte Bobcats were formed as an expansion team in 2004.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hornets temporarily relocated to Oklahoma City in 2005 for two seasons because of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina. The team returned to New Orleans in 2007.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new official game ball was introduced on June 28, 2006, for the 2006ÿ07 season, marking the first change to the ball in over 35 years and only the second ball in 60 seasons.[27] Manufactured by Spalding, the new ball featured a new design and new synthetic material that Spalding claimed offered a better grip, feel, and consistency than the original ball. However, many players were vocal in their disdain for the new ball, saying that it was too sticky when dry, and too slippery when wet.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommissioner Stern announced on December 11, 2006, that beginning January 1, 2007, the NBA would return to the traditional leather basketball in use prior to the 2006ÿ07 season. The change was influenced by frequent player complaints and confirmed hand injuries (cuts) caused by the microfiber ball.[28] The Players' Association had filed a suit on behalf of the players against the NBA over the new ball.[29] As of the 2017ÿ18 season, the NBA team jerseys are manufactured by Nike, replacing the previous supplier, Adidas. All teams will wear jerseys with the Nike logo except the Charlotte Hornets, whose jerseys will instead have the Jumpman logo associated with longtime Nike endorser Michael Jordan, who owns the Hornets.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation on July 19, 2007, over allegations that veteran NBA referee Tim Donaghy bet on basketball games he officiated over the past two seasons and that he made calls affecting the point spread in those games.[31] On August 15, 2007, Donaghy pleaded guilty to two federal charges related to the investigation. Donaghy claimed in 2008 that certain referees were friendly with players and \\"company men\\" for the NBA, and he alleged that referees influenced the outcome of certain playoff and finals games in 2002 and 2005. NBA commissioner David Stern denied the allegations and said Donaghy was a convicted felon and a \\"singing, cooperating witness\\".[32] Donaghy served 15 months in prison and was released in November 2009.[33] According to an independent study by Ronald Beech of Game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Sacramento Kings, although the refs increased the Lakers' chances of winning through foul calls during the game, there was no collusion to fix the game. On alleged \\"star treatment\\" during Game 6 by the refs toward certain players, Beech claimed, \\"there does seem to be issues with different standards and allowances for different players.\\" [34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA Board of Governors approved the request of the Seattle SuperSonics to relocate to Oklahoma City on April 18, 2008.[35] The team, however, could not move until it had settled a lawsuit filed by the city of Seattle, which was intended to keep the SuperSonics in Seattle for the remaining two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena. Following a court case, the city of Seattle settled with the ownership group of the SuperSonics on July 2, 2008, allowing the team to move to Oklahoma City immediately in exchange for terminating the final two seasons of the team's lease at KeyArena.[36] The Oklahoma City Thunder began playing in the 2008ÿ09 season.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first outdoor game in the modern era of the league was played at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden on October 11, 2008, between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nA referee lockout began on September 1, 2009, when the contract between the NBA and its referees expired. The first preseason games were played on October 1, 2009, and replacement referees from the WNBA and NBA Development League were used, the first time replacement referees had been used since the beginning of the 1995ÿ96 season. The NBA and the regular referees reached a deal on October 23, 2009.[38][39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first official NBA league games on European ground took place in 2011. In two matchups, the New Jersey Nets faced the Toronto Raptors at the O2 Arena in London in front of over 20,000 fans.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2011ÿ12 NBA season, scheduled to begin November 1, 2011, with a matchup between the defending champion Dallas Mavericks and the Chicago Bulls, was postponed due to a labor dispute. The lockout officially ended on December 8, 2011, when players and owners ratified a new collective bargaining agreement, and the season began on Christmas Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the 2012ÿ13 season, the New Orleans Hornets renamed themselves the Pelicans.[40] During the 2013ÿ14 season, Stern retired as commissioner after 30 years, and deputy commissioner Adam Silver ascended to the position of commissioner. During that season's playoffs, the Bobcats officially reclaimed the Hornets name, and by agreement with the league and the Pelicans, also received sole ownership of all history, records, and statistics from the Pelicans' time in Charlotte. As a result, the Hornets are now officially considered to have been founded in 1988, suspended operations in 2002, and resumed in 2004 as the Bobcats, while the Pelicans are officially treated as a 2002 expansion team.[41] (This is somewhat similar to the relationship between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the NFL.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDonald Sterling, who was then-owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, received a lifetime ban from the NBA on April 29, 2014, after racist remarks he made became public. Sterling was also fined US$2.5 million, the maximum allowed under the NBA Constitution.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nBecky Hammon was hired by the San Antonio Spurs on August 5, 2014, as an assistant coach, becoming the second female coach in NBA history but the first full-time coach.[43][44] This also makes her the first full-time female coach in any of the four major professional sports in North America.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA announced on April 15, 2016, that it would allow all 30 of its member clubs to sell corporate sponsor advertisement patches on official game uniforms, beginning with the 2017ÿ18 season. The sponsorship advertisement patches would appear on the left front of jerseys, opposite Nike's logo, marking the first time a manufacturer's logo would appear on NBA jerseys, and would measure approximately 2.5 by 2.5 inches. The NBA would become the first major North American professional sports league to allow corporate sponsorship logos on official team uniforms, and the last to have a uniform manufacturer logo appear on its team uniforms.[45] The first team to announce a jersey sponsorship was the Philadelphia 76ers, who agreed to a deal with StubHub.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 6, 2017, the NBA unveiled an updated rendition of its logo; it is largely identical to the previous design, except with revised typography and a \\"richer\\" color scheme. The league began to phase in the updated logo across its properties during the 2017 NBA Summer League, but it will not immediately be used on equipment or uniforms due to lead time.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA also officially released new Nike uniforms for all 30 teams beginning with the 2017ÿ18 season. The league eliminated \\"home\\" and \\"away\\" uniform designations. Instead, each team would have four uniforms: the \\"Association\\" edition, which is the team's traditional white uniform, the \\"Icon\\" edition, which is the team's primary color uniform, and two other uniform editions, to be unveiled at a later date.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA originated in 1946 with 11 teams, and through a sequence of team expansions, reductions, and relocations currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004ÿ05 season. Reflecting the population distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country: thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the players for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with which they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held. Preseason matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season begins in the last week of October.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its own division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team plays all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the strength of schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team will have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road), 180 games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and 150 games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League). Each team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day.[49] The league has been playing games regularly on the holiday since 1947,[50] though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until 1983ÿ84.[51] Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players.[49][50][51] Christmas is also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television each season.[50][51] Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains. Fan votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then, the top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter in the league eanrs first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded with a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally Rookie Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with the current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest time; the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a given time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various sponsors who have paid for naming rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the season (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time.[52] After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades are often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAround the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for individual awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than actual games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach of the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most Valuable Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally, Sporting News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists of five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NBA Playoffs begin in late April, with the top eight teams in each conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the Championship. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular-season record (with a tiebreaker system used as needed).\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. Before the league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006ÿ07 season, this meant that, for example, if the team that received the 6 seed had a better record than the team with the 3 seed (by virtue of a divisional championship), the 6 seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team had a higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the Northwest Division and the #3 seed. Their opponent was the #6 seed Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47 games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the series matching the 1st and 8th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 4th and 5th seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the 2nd and 7th seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the 3rd and 6th seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series follows a 2ÿ2ÿ1ÿ1ÿ1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2ÿ3ÿ2 pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in games 3, 4, and 5.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA Finals, and is held annually in June. The victor in the NBA Finals wins the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Each player and major contributorincluding coaches and the general manageron the winning team receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award to the best performing player of the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless of divisional alignment, in the 2015ÿ16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls and Golden State Warriors (2 in Philadelphia, 4 in Oakland) with six championships each. The San Antonio Spurs have five championships, all since 1999.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrent teams that have no NBA Finals appearances:\\r\\n\\r\\nAs one of the major sports leagues in North America, the National Basketball Association has a long history of partnership with television networks in the United States. The League signed a contract with DuMont in its 8th season (1953ÿ54), marking the first year the NBA had a national television broadcaster. Similar to NFL, the lack of television stations leads to NBC taking over the rights beginning the very next season until April 7, 1962 - NBC's first tenure with the NBA. Currently in the U.S., the NBA has a contract with ESPN and TNT through the 2024ÿ25 season. Games that are not broadcast nationally are usually aired over regional sports network specific to the area where the teams are located.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Basketball Association has sporadically participated in international club competitions. From 1987 to 1999 the NBA champions played against the continental champions of the Fdration Internationale de Basketball (FIBA) in the McDonald's Championship. This tournament was won by the NBA invitee every year it was held.[55]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2012, a ticket cost from $10 to $3,000 apiece, depending on the location of the seat and the success of the teams that were playing.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to Nielsen's survey, the NBA has the youngest audience, with 45 percent of its viewers under 35, but the least likely, along with Major League Baseball, to be watched by women, who make up only 30% of the viewership. It also has the highest share of black viewers with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being white, making it the only top North American sport that doesn't have a white majority audience.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing pioneers like Vlade Divac (Serbia) and Dra?en Petrovi? (Croatia) who joined the NBA in the late 1980s, an increasing number of international players have moved directly from playing elsewhere in the world to starring in the NBA. Below is a short list of foreign players who have won NBA awards or have been otherwise recognized for their contributions to basketball, either currently or formerly active in the league:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn some occasions, young players, most but not all from the English-speaking world, have attended U.S. colleges before playing in the NBA. Notable examples are:\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2006, the NBA has faced EuroLeague teams in exhibition matches in the NBA Europe Live Tour, and since 2009 in the EuroLeague American Tour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2013ÿ14 season opened with a record 92 international players on the opening night rosters, representing 39 countries and comprising over 20% of the league[24] The NBA defines \\"international\\" players as those born outside the 50 United States and Washington, D.C.

It was the twelfth most visited theme park in North America in 2015.[2] The park features 35 rides including roller coasters, family rides, children's rides, water rides, and historical rides, and it employs about 10,000 seasonal and full-time employees.[3]\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott, Cordelia Knott, and their family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors. Cordelia Knott's efforts in the Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant were essential to putting Knott's Berry Farm on the map, and the ensuing crowds prompted the creation of even more tourist attractions. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica ghost town on the property. Knott added several other attractions over the years, and began charging admission to the attractions in 1968. In 1983, Knott's Berry Farm added Camp Snoopy, which began the park's present-day association with the Peanuts characters.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, following the deaths of Walter and Cordelia Knott, their children sold the theme park to Cedar Fair and the family's food business to ConAgra Foods, which subsequently sold it to J. M. Smucker. Cedar Fair has continued to expand the theme park, adding Knott's Soak City in 1999 and adding new rides to the original park.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theme park sits on the site of a former berry farm established by Walter Knott and his family. Beginning around 1920, the Knott family sold berries, berry preserves, and pies from a roadside stand along State Route 39. In 1934, the Knotts began selling fried chicken dinners in a tea room on the property, later called \\"Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant\\". The dinners soon became a major tourist draw, and the Knotts built several shops and other attractions to entertain visitors while waiting for a seat in the restaurant. In 1940, Walter Knott began constructing a replica Ghost Town on the property, the beginning of the present-day theme park. The idea of an amusement park really picked up in the 1950s when Walter Knott opened a \\"summer-long county fair\\".\\r\\nIn 1968, for the first time, an admission price was required to get into the park, originally set at 25 cents. The Calico log ride was added in 1969. The park became a popular destination for conservative college students in the 1960s, especially as conservative organizations like the California Free Enterprise Association, the Libres Foundation, and the Americanism Educational League were based there.[4] According to Assistant Professor Caroline Rolland-Diamond of the Paris West University Nanterre La Dfense:\\r\\nit also appealed to conservative Americans, young and old, because the idealized representation of a past devoid of social and racial tensions that it offered stood in sharp contrast with the political and social upheavals affecting California since the Free Speech Movement erupted at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964.\\r\\nOn April 12, 1974, Cordelia Knott died. Walter turned his attention toward political causes,[6][7] Roaring Twenties[8] re-themed Gypsy Camp in the 1970s with the addition of a nostalgic traditional amusement area, Wheeler Dealer Bumper Cars, Knott's Bear-y Tales. Then with the northward expansion of a 1920s-era Knott's Airfield themed area featuring the Cloud 9 Dance Hall, Sky Cabin/Parachute Sky Jump and Motorcycle Chase steeple chase roller coaster above the electric guided rail Gasoline Alley car ride.[9]\\r\\nSky Tower with the illuminated \\"K\\" in logo script at the top was built to support two attractions, the Parachute Sky Jump (now closed) and the Sky Cabin (now closed). Parachute Sky Jump boarded one or two standing riders anticipating the thrill of the drop into baskets beneath a faux parachute canopy. From the top, eight arms supported the vertical cable tracks of wire rope which lifted the baskets. The Sky Cabin ringed the support pole with a single floor of seats that are enclosed behind windows. The Sky Cabin ring revolves slowly as it rises to the top and back offering a pleasantly changing vista. Sky Cabin is very sensitive to weather and passenger motion, such as walking, which is prohibited during the trip. During winds 25?mph+ or rain it is closed. When built, Sky Tower was the tallest structure in Orange County (a distinction briefly held by WindSeeker before its relocation to Worlds of Fun in 2012.)\\r\\nMotorcycle Chase?ÿ A modernized steeplechase rollercoaster built in 1976 by Arrow Development, featured single motorbike themed vehicles racing side-by-side, each on one of four parallel tracks, launched together.[9] One or two riders straddled each \\"Indian motorcycle\\" attraction vehicle. The tubular steel monorail track closely followed dips and bumps in \\"the road\\" and tilted to lean riders about the curves. Gasoline Alley, an electric steel-guiderail car ride below, was built together and intimately intertwined, which enhanced ride-to-ride interaction thrill value.[10] Rider safety concerns of the high center of gravity coupled with the method of rider restraints caused it to be re-themed Wacky Soap Box Racers with vehicles now attached in four car trains, each car seated two riders, strapped in low (nearly straddling the track), surrounded by the close fitting car sides, and the dips and bumps of the track were straightened flat in 1980. Motorcycle Chase/Wacky Soap Box Racers was removed 1996 for a dueling loop coaster Windjammer Surf Racers and now Xcelerator, a vertical launch coaster, takes its place.\\r\\nOn December 3, 1981, Walter Knott died, survived by his children who would continue to operate Knott's as a family business for another fourteen years.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Knott's built the Barn Dance featured Bobbi & Clyde as the house band. It was during the height of the \\"Urban Cowboy\\" era. The \\"Barn Dance\\" was featured in Knott's TV Commercials.\\r\\nDuring the 1980s, Knott's met the competition in Southern California theme parks by theming a new land and building two massive attractions:\\r\\nThe Boomerang roller coaster replaced the Corkscrew[8] in 1990 with a lift shuttle train passing to and fro through a cobra roll and a vertical loop for six inversions each trip.\\r\\nMystery Lodge (1994),[11] inspired by General Motors \\"Spirit Lodge\\" pavilion, was a live show augmented with Peppers Ghost and other special effects, which was among the most popular exhibits at Expo 86 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, which was produced by Bob Rogers of BRC Imagination Arts[12] and created with the assistance of the Kwagulth Native reserve in Alert Bay, British Columbia.[13] Mystery Lodge recreates a quiet summer night in the village of Alert Bay, British Columbia then guests \\"move inside\\" the longhouse and listen to the storyteller weave a tale of the importance of family from the smoke of the bonfire.\\r\\nThe Jaguar! was opened June 17, 1995, to add another roller coaster to the mix of Fiesta Village alongside Montezooma's Revenge.\\r\\nIn the 1990s, after Walter and Cordelia died, their children decided to sell off their businesses:\\r\\nIn the late 1990s Cedar Fair acquired the Buena Park Hotel at the corner of Grand Ave. and Crescent. It was then brought up to Radisson standards and branded Radisson Resort Hotel as a franchise. In 2004, the park renamed the Radisson Resort Hotel the Knott's Berry Farm Resort Hotel.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Knott family sold the food specialty business to ConAgra Foods, which later re-sold the brand to The J.M. Smucker Company in 2008.\\r\\nIn 1997, the Knott family sold the amusement park operations to Cedar Fair Entertainment Company. Initially, the Knotts were given an opportunity to sell the park to The Walt Disney Company. The park would have been amalgamated into the Disneyland Resort and converted into Disney's America, which had previously failed to be built near Washington, D.C. The Knotts refused to sell the park to Disney out of fear most of what Walter Knott had built would be eliminated.\\r\\nSince being acquired by Cedar Fair, the park has seen an aggressive shift towards thrill rides, with the construction of a number of large roller coasters and the addition of a high-performance Shoot-the-Chutes ride Perilous Plunge. Perilous Plunge had the record of being the tallest and steepest water ride in the world until September 2012 when it was closed and removed.[14] Also, in 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that the most popular ride at the park, the Timber Mountain Log Ride, would be closed for a major 5 month refurbishment, led by Garner Holt Productions, Inc.[15]\\r\\nOn May 25, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm added three new family rides on the site of former Perilous Plunge. They include: Coast Rider (wild mouse roller coaster), Pacific Scrambler (Scrambler ride) and Surfside Gilders. All three of the rides added to the Boardwalk theme. The old bridge which connected the exit of Perlious Plunge and the boardwalk is now used as the entrance to Surfside Gilders and Pacific Scrambler. The Boomerang roller coaster was also repainted a lime-green color as part of the Boardwalk expansion.\\r\\nOn September 2, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced that Windseeker would be removed from the park. The ride was removed and sent to Worlds of Fun for the 2014 season.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm made a major announcement for the 2014 operating season; the famous and historical Calico Mine Ride would be closed for a major 6 month refurbishment beginning in January 2014.[16]\\r\\nThe park's annual Knott's Scary Farm has drawn crowds since 1973. The idea for this event was presented at one of the regularly scheduled round table meetings for managers by Patricia Pawson. The actual event was created by Bill Hollingshead, Gary Salisbury, Martha Boyd and Gene Witham, along with other members of the Knott's Berry Farm Entertainment Department as documented in the DVD Season of Screams. Initially fake corpses and other static figures were rented from Hollywood prop house, but Bud Hurlbut, the creator/concessionaire of the Mine Ride, Log Ride and other rides at Knott's, decided that this wasn't enough.[25] He dressed up in a gorilla suit, and started scaring guests on the Mine Ride. Halloween Haunt was an instant hit, and by the next year, the event sold out nightly.[26] During this special ticketed event, the entire park (or major portions of it) re-themes itself into a \\"haunted house\\" style attraction in the form of mazes and \\"scare zones\\" in the evening. Over a thousand specially employed monsters are also scattered?ÿ often hidden out of view?ÿ throughout the park at this time. Some of the characters have become well-known, such as the green witch, which has been portrayed by Charlene Parker since 1983, the longest of any performer.[27][28][29][30][31][32][33] Several attractions are decorated for the event including the Timber Mountain Log Ride and Calico Mine Train and there are 13 mazes of various themes. Elvira (actress Cassandra Peterson) was introduced into the Halloween Event in 1982 and was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal,[34] although she returned for one night in 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the event and has returned as a regular performer throughout the run of the event for the last several years.[35] During the month of October, Knott's Scary Farm generates half the revenue for Knott's Berry Farm's fiscal year.[citation needed]\\r\\nSeason of Screams is a DVD produced by an independent company which traces the beginnings of Halloween Haunt and the story behind how it all got started back in 1973. Season of Screams also highlights recent Halloween Haunts.\\r\\nWinter Coaster Solace is an event that takes place in the first or second weekend of March every year when roller coaster enthusiasts can come before the park opens and stay after the park closes to ride the rides and eat at the Chicken Dinner Restaurant. It is intended to provide \\"solace\\" to visitors from other parts of the country where theme parks and roller coasters are seasonal, not year-round operations like the Southern California parks. Knott's Berry Farm also used to give attendees behind the scenes tours of the rides.\\r\\nEvery year since 1991, Knott's has offered free admission to veterans and their families during the month of November. Though this was originally started as a tribute to returning Gulf War veterans, they subsequently expanded it to include all veterans and have run it every year since.\\r\\nA Christmas event known as \\"Knott's Merry Farm\\" also happens annually. Previous Merry Farm events have included manufactured snow, handcrafts exhibits, and a visit with Santa Claus. This event was originally created by Gary Salisbury in the Fall of 1985.\\r\\nPraise (festival) has been a Christian themed celebration presented many years as a mix-in special event of music and comedy on New Year's Eve.\\r\\nThe park consists of five themed areas:\\r\\nCraftsmen in Ghost Town demonstrate the arts of the blacksmith, woodcarver, glass-blower, sign cutter, and spinner. Demonstrations of narrow gauge railroading and farm equipment hobbyists accompany additional merchant stalls of cottage-craft fairs seasonally at discounted admission which is restricted to Ghost Town only.\\r\\nWestern Trails Museum, relocated between the candy store and the General Store to accommodate Bigfoot Rapids, still features historical western artifacts large and small, from a hand powered horse-drawn fire engine to miniature replica of a borax hauling \\"Twenty Mule Team\\" and utensils necessary to survive the prairie and wilderness.\\r\\nThe Ghost Town area has a few other notable attractions. The Bird Cage Theatre only hosts two seasonal entertainments?ÿ during \\"Knott's Merry Farm,\\" two small productions of \\"The Gift of the Magi\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and a Halloween Haunt thrill show. The Calico Stage, a large open-air stage in Calico Square, hosts a variety of shows and acts, big and small, from those of elementary school students, Gallagher, a local band, and the summer-spectacular All Wheels Extreme stunt show featuring youthful performers demonstrating aerial tricks with acrobatics, trampolines, and riding ramps with skates, scooters, skateboards, and freestyle bikes to popular music. Calico Saloon recreates the revelry of music, singing and dancing, with Cameo Kate hosting a variety of acts. Jersey Lily, Judge Roy Bean's combination courthouse/saloon, offers certified comical \\"genuine illegal hitchin'\\" alongside pickles, candy, and sports/soft drinks.\\r\\nMany parts of Ghost Town are forever lost to progress. The conversion of the Silver Dollar Saloon to a shooting gallery, Hunters Paradise shooting gallery to Panda Express and the original Berry Stand, moved several times with its last location now occupied by the Silver Bullet station.\\r\\nWhat is left of Ghost Town today was based on Calico ghost town and other real ghost towns in the Western United States such as Prescott, Arizona. Walter Knott inherited his uncle's silver mill and land, then bought more of the actual Calico ghost town in 1951 and developed it. In 1966, he donated that property to the corporate-municipal County of San Bernardino which then made the town of Calico, California into a public historic park, for which it charged an entrance/parking fee. See 'History?ÿ Ghost Town?ÿ Calico' section above.\\r\\nWild Water Wilderness is a section of Ghost Town that features two major rides: the Bigfoot Rapids river rafting adventure, and Pony Express, a horse themed family roller coaster installed in 2008. Nearby Bigfoot Rapids is Rapids Trader, a small merchandise stand. It is also home to Mystery Lodge, a multimedia show based on an Expo 86 pavilion featuring a Native American storyteller.\\r\\nFiesta Village was built in 1969 with a pop-culture Mexican theme. It was the second area constructed after the completion of Ghost Town. Stores like Casa California, restaurants like Pancho's Tacos, La Papa Loca, and La Victoria Cantina, games like Shoot If Yucan, and the themed rides like La Revoluci܇n, Jaguar!, and Montezooma's Revenge, along with the former attraction Tampico Tumbler, all contribute to the Mexican and Aztec theme of the area. In 2013 colorful string lights were added for the summer season.\\r\\nOriginally themed as Gypsy Camp, and later re-themed to the \\"Roaring '20s\\", \\"Knott's Airfield\\", then \\"The Boardwalk\\", this area is home to the most of Knott's major thrill rides.\\r\\nBoardwalk Games include physical challenges such as a rock wall, soccer, basketball and a rope ladder crawl. A variety of traditional pitch three balls and win a prize type games, such as squirt gun into clowns mouth, knock off milk bottles, pitch a quarter onto a plate are pitched by hawkers along the Boardwalk Games midway. In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for an expansion of the Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.\\r\\nThe world's largest Johnny Rockets restaurant franchise is located at Knott's Boardwalk, featuring over 5,900 square feet (550?m2) of indoor dining space for more than 260 guests.\\r\\nCamp Snoopy is home to the park's family and children rides, with many of the rides and attractions being built specifically for children and guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive attractions. Its theme is Charles M. Schulz' \\"Peanuts\\" comic strip characters. Snoopy has been the mascot of Knott's Berry Farm since 1983, and the characters can now be seen at all of Cedar Fair's parks, except Gilroy Gardens, which is managed by Cedar Fair and owned by the city of Gilroy. The 14 rides include a mini roller coaster called the Timberline Twister, a mini-scrambler called the Log Peeler, a Zamperla Rockin' Tug called Lucy's Tugboat, and a steel spinning roller coaster called Sierra Sidewinder. Snoopy Bounce is a small attraction for kids. However, it is not considered a ride at the park. For guests who cannot ride the park's more aggressive and thrilled rides, Camp Snoopy contains a good number of rides for guests of all ages including infants, children, and seniors. With the exception of Sierra Sidewinder and Timberline Twister, the rides are relativity tame and not aggressive.\\r\\nKnott's Berry Farm also built the Mall of America's indoor theme park, which itself was originally called Camp Snoopy. (In fact, Charles M. Schulz hailed from St. Paul.) However, today the park is no longer affiliated with Knott's or Cedar Fair, and is now called Nickelodeon Universe.\\r\\nOn November 22, 2013, Knott's Berry Farm announced major improvements in the area of Camp Snoopy. Camp Snoopy will receive a makeover as the section is approaching its 30th anniversary. In summer 2014, Knott's Berry Farm will open up new rides in Camp Snoopy.[16]\\r\\nThe 2?ft (610?mm) narrow gauge[42] Grand Sierra Scenic Railroad takes guest on a four-minute train ride through the reflection lake. The ride was made shorter with the construction of Silver Bullet.\\r\\nLocated next to the Bottle House in Ghost Town, Indian Trails is a small area sandwiched between Camp Snoopy, Ghost Town, and Fiesta Village, showcasing Native American art, crafts, and dance. One ride is located in this area. It is called Butterfield Stagecoach which is a family ride where an actual stagecoach take guest on a circular ride through Fiesta Village and Camp Snoopy. It is one of the original rides at the park. The ride was developed directly by the park and it opened in 1949.\\r\\nMany of the original attractions are outside the gates of the current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, or things which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.\\r\\nThe east side of the property, divided by Beach Blvd., features the main parking lot, Knott's Soak City a seasonal water park that requires separate admission, the picnic grounds rental areas, complementary admission to Independence Hall and gift shop, and the Church of Reflections which was moved outside the theme park in 2004 and held non-denominational Sunday services until 2010, but is still used for wedding ceremonies. A tunnel and pedestrian underpass beneath Beach Blvd. connects the main parking lot to the shops, restaurants and theme park.\\r\\nFor Halloween Haunt in 2016, Knott's Berry Farm introduced FearVR: 5150, a virtual reality attraction that was met with controversy from the mental health community regarding the negative portrayal of mental illness.[45] The ten-minute-long attraction immersed guests inside of a chaotic mental hospital haunted by a supernatural central character named Katie and zombie-like patients.[46] The initial controversy came from the attraction's name, with 5150 referring to the California law that allows a law enforcement officer or clinician to involuntarily commit a person suspected of having a mental illness and determined \\"a danger to themselves or others\\". The backlash was focused on Cedar Fair's use of painful experiences suffered by those dealing with mental illness and to have it \\"transmogrified into spooky entertainment\\".[45] In response, Cedar Fair removed \\"5150\\" from the name, and after continued opposition, permanently closed the attraction on September 28, 2016, only six days after its debut.[47][48] A petition was signed by more than 2,000 people hoping Cedar Fair would bring it back, with the petition's organizer stating that Cedar Fair shouldn't be \\"forced to shut down an attraction based on the words of people who had not even experienced the attraction\\".[49]\\r\\nKnott's Soak City is Knott's Berry Farm's water park. It opened in 1999 as Soak City U.S.A. It requires separate admission from Knott's Berry Farm.\\r\\nFast Lane is Knott's Berry Farm's virtual queue system. For an extra fee, visitors get a wrist band that enables them to get to the front of the line on some of the most popular attractions without queuing.\\r\\nThe J. M. Smucker Company continues to sell the jam and preserves made famous by the Knott family, however other products such as the syrups have been discontinued due to low demand.[50]\\r\\nIn November 2013, Knott's Berry Farm began selling their \\"Berry Market\\" brand of preserves at the park. The Berry Market brand is all natural and uses the Knott family's original recipe. They are unable to use \\"Knott's\\" on the label, since Smucker's owns the rights to the name.","input":"What is the oldest part of knott's berry farm?"},{"output":"Red Army","context":"Victory for the Red Army in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, South Caucasus, Central Asia, Tuva, and Mongolia;\\r\\n Russian SFSR and other Soviet republics\\r\\n Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine (1919ÿ20)\\r\\n Left SR (until March 1918)\\r\\n White Movement\\r\\nOther new republics\\r\\nPro-German armies\\r\\n Vladimir Lenin\\r\\n Leon Trotsky\\r\\n Mikhail Tukhachevsky\\r\\n Jukums Vcietis\\r\\n Sergey Kamenev\\r\\n Mikhail Bonch-Bruyevich\\r\\n Kliment Voroshilov\\r\\n Mikhail Frunze\\r\\n3,000,000[3]\\r\\nThe Russian Civil War (Russian: ? ־񳭷? ־ ˾?, tr. Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi; November 1917 ÿ October 1922)[1] was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.[4] The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000ÿ12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.[5]\\r\\nMany pro-independence movements emerged after the break-up of the Russian Empire and fought in the war.[2] Several parts of the former Russian EmpireFinland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandwere established as sovereign states, with their own civil wars and wars of independence. The rest of the former Russian Empire was consolidated into the Soviet Union shortly afterwards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the Russian Provisional Government was established during the February Revolution of 1917.\\r\\nFrom mid-1917 onwards, the Russian Army, the successor-organisation of the old Russian Imperial Army, started to disintegrate;[6] the Bolsheviks used the volunteer-based Red Guards as their main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the Cheka (the Bolshevik state-security apparatus). In January 1918, after significant Bolshevik reverses in combat, the future People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Leon Trotsky headed the reorganization of the Red Guards into a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in order to create a more effective fighting force. The Bolsheviks appointed political commissars to each unit of the Red Army to maintain morale and to ensure loyalty.\\r\\nIn June 1918, when it had become apparent that a revolutionary army composed solely of workers would not suffice, Trotsky instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army.[7] The Bolsheviks overcame opposition of rural Russians to Red-Army conscription units by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance,[8] exactly the same practices used by the White Army officers.[9] The Red Army utilized former Tsarist officers as \\"military specialists\\" (voenspetsy),[10] sometimes their families were taken hostage in order to ensure their loyalty.[11] At the start of the civil war, former Tsarist officers comprised three-quarters of the Red Army officer-corps.[11] By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.[12]\\r\\nWhile resistance to the Red Guard began on the very day after the Bolshevik uprising, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the political ban [clarification needed] became a catalyst[13] for the formation of anti-Bolshevik groups both inside and outside Russia, pushing them into action against the new regime.\\r\\nA loose confederation of anti-Bolshevik forces aligned against the Communist government, including landowners, republicans, conservatives, middle-class citizens, reactionaries, pro-monarchists, liberals, army generals, non-Bolshevik socialists who still had grievances and democratic reformists voluntarily united only in their opposition to Bolshevik rule. Their military forces, bolstered by forced conscriptions and terror[9] and by foreign influence and led by Gen. Yudenich, Adm. Kolchak and Gen. Denikin, became known as the White movement (sometimes referred to as the \\"White Army\\") and controlled significant parts of the former Russian Empire for most of the war.\\r\\nA Ukrainian nationalist movement was active in Ukraine during the war. More significant was the emergence of an anarchist political and military movement known as the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine or the Anarchist Black Army led by Nestor Makhno. The Black Army, which counted numerous Jews and Ukrainian peasants in its ranks, played a key part in halting Gen. Denikin's White Army offensive towards Moscow during 1919, later ejecting White forces from Crimea.\\r\\nThe remoteness of the Volga Region, the Ural Region, Siberia and the Far East was favorable for the anti-Bolshevik forces, and the Whites set up a number of organizations in the cities of these regions. Some of the military forces were set up on the basis of clandestine officers' organizations in the cities.\\r\\nThe Czechoslovak Legions had been part of the Russian army and numbered around 30,000 troops by October 1917. They had an agreement with the new Bolshevik government to be evacuated from the Eastern Front via the port of Vladivostok to France. The transport from the Eastern Front to Vladivostok slowed down in the chaos, and the troops became dispersed all along the Trans-Siberian Railway. Under pressure from the Central Powers, Trotsky ordered the disarming and arrest of the legionaries, which created tensions with the Bolsheviks.\\r\\nThe Western Allies armed and supported opponents of the Bolsheviks. They were worried about (1) a possible Russo-German alliance, (2) the prospect of the Bolsheviks making good on their threats to default on Imperial Russia's massive foreign loans and (3) the possibility that the Communist revolutionary ideas would spread (a concern shared by many Central Powers). Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. Winston Churchill declared that Bolshevism must be \\"strangled in its cradle\\".[14] The British and French had supported Russia during World War I on a massive scale with war materials. After the treaty, it looked like much of that material would fall into the hands of the Germans. Under this pretext began allied intervention in the Russian Civil War with the United Kingdom and France sending troops into Russian ports. There were violent clashes with troops loyal to the Bolsheviks.\\r\\nThe German Empire created several short-lived satellite buffer states within its sphere of influence after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk: the \\"United Baltic Duchy\\", \\"Duchy of Courland and Semigallia\\", \\"Kingdom of Lithuania\\", \\"Kingdom of Poland\\", the \\"Belarusian Peoples Republic\\", and the \\"Ukrainian State\\". Following the defeat of Germany in World War I in November 1918, these states were abolished.\\r\\nFinland was the first republic that declared its independence from Russia in December 1917 and established itself in the ensuing Finnish Civil War from JanuaryÿMay 1918. The Second Polish Republic, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia formed their own armies immediately after the abolition of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty and the start of the Soviet westward offensive in November 1918.\\r\\nIn the European part of Russia the war was fought across three main fronts: the eastern, the southern and the northwestern. It can also be roughly split into the following periods.\\r\\nThe first period lasted from the Revolution until the Armistice. Already on the date of the Revolution, Cossack Gen. Kaledin refused to recognize it and assumed full governmental authority in the Don region,[15] where the Volunteer Army began amassing support. The signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk also resulted in direct Allied intervention in Russia and the arming of military forces opposed to the Bolshevik government. There were also many German commanders who offered support against the Bolsheviks, fearing a confrontation with them was impending as well.\\r\\nDuring this first period the Bolsheviks took control of Central Asia out of the hands of the Provisional Government and White Army, setting up a base for the Communist Party in the Steppe and Turkestan, where nearly two million Russian settlers were located.[16]\\r\\nMost of the fighting in this first period was sporadic, involving only small groups amid a fluid and rapidly shifting strategic scene. Among the antagonists were the Czechs, known as the Czechoslovak Legion or \\"White Czechs\\",[17] the Poles of the Polish 5th Rifle Division and the pro-Bolshevik Red Latvian riflemen.\\r\\nThe second period of the war lasted from January to November 1919. At first the White armies' advances from the south (under Gen. Denikin), the east (under Adm. Kolchak) and the northwest (under Gen. Yudenich) were successful, forcing the Red Army and its allies back on all three fronts. In July 1919 the Red Army suffered another reverse after a mass defection of units in the Crimea to the anarchist Black Army under Nestor Makhno, enabling anarchist forces to consolidate power in Ukraine. Leon Trotsky soon reformed the Red Army, concluding the first of two military alliances with the anarchists. In June the Red Army first checked Kolchak's advance. After a series of engagements, assisted by a Black Army offensive against White supply lines, the Red Army defeated Denikin's and Yudenich's armies in October and November.\\r\\nThe third period of the war was the extended siege of the last White forces in the Crimea. Gen. Wrangel had gathered the remnants of Denikin's armies, occupying much of the Crimea. An attempted invasion of southern Ukraine was rebuffed by the anarchist Black Army under the command of Nestor Makhno. Pursued into the Crimea by Makhno's troops, Wrangel went over to the defensive in the Crimea. After an abortive move north against the Red Army, Wrangel's troops were forced south by Red Army and Black Army forces; Wrangel and the remains of his army were evacuated to Constantinople in November 1920.\\r\\nIn the October Revolution the Bolshevik Party directed the Red Guard (armed groups of workers and Imperial army deserters) to seize control of Petrograd (Saint Petersburg) and immediately began the armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former Russian Empire. In January 1918 the Bolsheviks dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly and proclaimed the Soviets (workers councils) as the new government of Russia.\\r\\nThe first attempt to regain power from the Bolsheviks was made by the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising in October 1917. It was supported by the Junker Mutiny in Petrograd but was quickly put down by the Red Guard, notably the Latvian rifle division.\\r\\nThe initial groups that fought against the Communists were local Cossack armies that had declared their loyalty to the Provisional Government. Gen. Kaledin of the Don Cossacks and Gen. Semenov of the Siberian Cossacks were prominent among them. The leading Tsarist officers of the old regime also started to resist. In November, Gen. Alekseev, the Tsar's Chief of Staff during the First World War, began to organize the Volunteer Army in Novocherkassk. Volunteers of this small army were mostly officers of the old Russian army, military cadets and students. In December 1917 Alekseev was joined by Gen. Kornilov, Denikin and other Tsarist officers who had escaped from the jail, where they had been imprisoned following the abortive Kornilov affair just before the Revolution.[18] At the beginning of December 1917 groups of volunteers and Cossacks captured Rostov.\\r\\nHaving stated in the November 1917 Declaration of Rights of Nations of Russia that any nation under imperial Russian rule should be immediately given the power of self-determination, the Bolsheviks had begun to usurp the power of the Provisional Government in the territories of Central Asia soon after the establishment of the Turkestan Committee in Tashkent.[19] In April 1917 the Provisional Government set up this committee, which was mostly made up of former Tsarist officials.[20] The Bolsheviks attempted to take control of the Committee in Tashkent on 12 September 1917 but it was unsuccessful, and many leaders were arrested. However, because the Committee lacked representation of the native population and poor Russian settlers, they had to release the Bolshevik prisoners almost immediately due to public outcry, and a successful takeover of this government body took place two months later in November.[21] The triumph of the Bolshevik party over the Provisional Government during 1917 was mostly due to the support they received from the working class of Central Asia. The Leagues of Mohammedam Working People, which Russian settlers and natives who had been sent to work behind the lines for the Tsarist government in 1916 formed in March 1917, had led numerous strikes in the industrial centers throughout September 1917.[22] However, after the Bolshevik destruction of the Provisional Government in Tashkent, Muslim elites formed an autonomous government in Turkestan, commonly called the \\"Kokand autonomy\\" (or simply Kokand).[23] The White Russians supported this government body, which lasted several months because of Bolshevik troop isolation from Moscow.[24] In January 1918 the Soviet forces under Lt. Col. Muravyov invaded Ukraine and invested Kiev, where the Central Council of the Ukrainian People's Republic held power. With the help of the Kiev Arsenal Uprising, the Bolsheviks captured the city on 26 January.[25]\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks decided to immediately make peace with the German Empire and the Central Powers, as they had promised the Russian people before the Revolution.[26] Vladimir Lenin's political enemies attributed that decision to his sponsorship by the Foreign Office of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, offered to Lenin in hope that, with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. That suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to Petrograd.[27] However, after the military fiasco of the summer offensive (June 1917) by the Russian Provisional Government, and in particular after the failed summer offensive of the Provisional Government had devastated the structure of the Russian army, it became crucial that Lenin realize the promised peace.[28][29] Even before the failed summer offensive the Russian population was very skeptical about the continuation of the war. Western socialists had promptly arrived from France and from the UK to convince the Russians to continue the fight, but could not change the new pacifist mood of Russia.[30]\\r\\nOn 16 December 1917 an armistice was signed between Russia and the Central Powers in Brest-Litovsk and peace talks began.[31] As a condition for peace, the proposed treaty by the Central Powers conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to the German Empire and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting nationalists and conservatives. Leon Trotsky, representing the Bolsheviks, refused at first to sign the treaty while continuing to observe a unilateral cease-fire, following the policy of \\"No war, no peace\\".[32]\\r\\nIn view of this, on 18 February 1918 the Germans began Operation Faustschlag on the Eastern Front, encountering virtually no resistance in a campaign that lasted 11 days.[32] Signing a formal peace treaty was the only option in the eyes of the Bolsheviks because the Russian army was demobilized, and the newly formed Red Guard was incapable of stopping the advance. They also understood that the impending counterrevolutionary resistance was more dangerous than the concessions of the treaty, which Lenin viewed as temporary in the light of aspirations for a world revolution. The Soviets acceded to a peace treaty, and the formal agreement, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was ratified on 6 March. The Soviets viewed the treaty as merely a necessary and expedient means to end the war. Therefore, they ceded large amounts of territory to the German Empire.\\r\\nUnder Soviet pressure, the Volunteer Army embarked on the epic Ice March from Yekaterinodar to Kuban on 22 February 1918, where they joined with the Kuban Cossacks to mount an abortive assault on Yekaterinodar.[33] The Soviets recaptured Rostov on the next day.[34] Gen. Kornilov was killed in the fighting on 13 April, and Gen. Denikin took over command. Fighting off its pursuers without respite, the army succeeded in breaking its way through back towards the Don, where the Cossack uprising against Bolsheviks had started.\\r\\nThe Baku Soviet Commune was established on 13 April. Germany landed its Caucasus Expedition troops in Poti on 8 June. The Ottoman Army of Islam (in coalition with Azerbaijan) drove them out of Baku on 26 July 1918. Subsequently, the Dashanaks, Right SRs and Mensheviks started negotiations with Gen. Dunsterville, the commander of the British troops in Persia. The Bolsheviks and their Left SR allies were opposed to it, but on 25 July the majority of the Soviet voted to call in the British and the Bolsheviks resigned. The Baku Soviet Commune ended its existence and was replaced by the Central Caspian Dictatorship.\\r\\nIn June 1918 the Volunteer Army, numbering some 9,000 men, started its second Kuban campaign. Yekaterinodar was encircled on 1 August and fell on the 3rd. In SeptemberÿOctober, heavy fighting took place at Armavir and Stavropol. On 13 October Gen. Kazanovich's division took Armavir, and on 1 November Gen. Pyotr Wrangel secured Stavropol. This time Red forces had no escape, and by the beginning of 1919 the whole Northern Caucasus was controlled by the Volunteer Army.\\r\\nIn October Gen. Alekseev, the leader of the White armies in southern Russia, died of a heart attack. An agreement was reached between Denikin, head of the Volunteer Army, and PN Krasnov, Ataman of the Don Cossacks, which united their forces under the sole command of Denikin. The Armed Forces of South Russia were thus created.\\r\\nThe revolt of the Czechoslovak Legion broke out in May 1918,[35] and the legionaries took control of Chelyabinsk in June. Simultaneously Russian officers' organizations overthrew the Bolsheviks in Petropavlovsk (in present-day Kazakhstan) and in Omsk. Within a month the Whites controlled most of the Trans-Siberian Railroad between Lake Baikal and the Ural regions. During the summer Bolshevik power in Siberia was eliminated. The Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia formed in Omsk. By the end of July the Whites had extended their gains westwards, capturing Ekaterinburg on 26 July 1918. Shortly before the fall of Yekaterinburg on 17 July 1918, the former Tsar and his family were executed by the Ural Soviet to prevent them falling into the hands of the Whites.\\r\\nMensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries supported peasants fighting against Soviet control of food supplies.[citation needed] In May 1918, with the support of the Czechoslovak Legion, they took Samara and Saratov, establishing the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assemblyknown as the \\"Komuch\\". By July the authority of the Komuch extended over much of the area controlled by the Czechoslovak Legion. The Komuch pursued an ambivalent social policy, combining democratic and socialist measures, such as the institution of an eight-hour working day, with \\"restorative\\" actions, such as returning both factories and land to their former owners. After the fall of Kazan, Vladimir Lenin called for the dispatch of Petrograd workers to the Kazan Front: \\"We must send down the maximum number of Petrograd workers: (1) a few dozen 'leaders' like Kayurov; (2) a few thousand militants 'from the ranks'\\".[36]\\r\\nAfter a series of reverses at the front, the Bolsheviks' War Commissar, Trotsky, instituted increasingly harsh measures in order to prevent unauthorized withdrawals, desertions and mutinies in the Red Army. In the field the Cheka special investigations forces, termed the Special Punitive Department of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combat of Counter-Revolution and Sabotage or Special Punitive Brigades, followed the Red Army, conducting field tribunals and summary executions of soldiers and officers who deserted, retreated from their positions or failed to display sufficient offensive zeal.[37][38] Trotsky extended the use of the death penalty to the occasional political commissar whose detachment retreated or broke in the face of the enemy.[citation needed] In August, frustrated at continued reports of Red Army troops breaking under fire, Trotsky authorized the formation of barrier troops - stationed behind unreliable Red Army units and given with orders to shoot anyone withdrawing from the battle line without authorization.[39]\\r\\nIn September 1918 Komuch, the Siberian Provisional Government and other local anti-Soviet governments met in Ufa and agreed to form a new Provisional All-Russian Government in Omsk, headed by a Directory of five: two Socialist-Revolutionaries (Nikolai Avksentiev and Vladimir Zenzinov), two Kadets (V. A. Vinogradov?(ru) and PV Vologodskii) and General Vasily Boldyrev.\\r\\nBy the fall of 1918 anti-Bolshevik White forces in the east included the People's Army (Komuch), the Siberian Army (of the Siberian Provisional Government) and insurgent Cossack units of Orenburg, Ural, Siberia, Semirechye, Baikal, Amur and Ussuri Cossacks, nominally under the orders of Gen. V.G. Boldyrev, Commander-in-Chief, appointed by the Ufa Directorate.\\r\\nOn the Volga, Col. Kappel's White detachment captured Kazan on 7 August, but the Reds re-captured the city on 8 September 1918 following a counteroffensive. On the 11th Simbirsk fell, and on 8 October Samara. The Whites fell back eastwards to Ufa and Orenburg.\\r\\nIn Omsk the Russian Provisional Government quickly came under the influence - then the dominance - of its new War Minister, Rear-Admiral Kolchak. On 18 November a coup d'tat established Kolchak as dictator. The members of the Directory were arrested and Kolchak proclaimed the \\"Supreme Ruler of Russia\\". By mid-December 1918 White armies had to leave Ufa, but they balanced this failure with a successful drive towards Perm, which they took on 24 December.\\r\\nIn February 1918 the Red Army overthrew the White Russian-supported Kokand autonomy of Turkestan.[40] Although this move seemed to solidify Bolshevik power in Central Asia, more troubles soon arose for the Red Army as the Allied Forces began to intervene. British support of the White Army provided the greatest threat to the Red Army in Central Asia during 1918. Great Britain sent three prominent military leaders to the area. One was Lt. Col. Bailey, who recorded a mission to Tashkent, from where the Bolsheviks forced him to flee. Another was Gen. Malleson, leading the Malleson Mission, who assisted the Mensheviks in Ashkhabad (now the capital of Turkmenistan) with a small Anglo-Indian force. However, he failed to gain control of Tashkent, Bukhara and Khiva. The third was Maj. Gen. Dunsterville, who the Bolsheviks drove out of Central Asia only a month after his arrival in August 1918.[41] Despite setbacks due to British invasions during 1918, the Bolsheviks continued to make progress in bringing the Central Asian population under their influence. The first regional congress of the Russian Communist Party convened in the city of Tashkent in June 1918 in order to build support for a local Bolshevik Party.[42]\\r\\nIn July two Left SR and Cheka employees, Blyumkin and Andreyev, assassinated the German ambassador, Count Mirbach. In Moscow a Left SR uprising was put down by the Bolsheviks, using Cheka military detachments. Lenin personally apologized to the Germans for the assassination. Mass arrests of Socialist-Revolutionaries followed.\\r\\nEstonia cleared its territory of the Red Army by January 1919.[43] Baltic German volunteers captured Riga from the Red Latvian Riflemen on 22 May, but the Estonian 3rd Division defeated the Baltic Germans a month later, aiding the establishment of the Republic of Latvia.[44]\\r\\nThis rendered possible another threat to the Red Armyone from Gen. Yudenich, who had spent the summer organizing the Northwestern Army in Estonia with local and British support. In October 1919 he tried to capture Petrograd in a sudden assault with a force of around 20,000 men. The attack was well-executed, using night attacks and lightning cavalry maneuvers to turn the flanks of the defending Red Army. Yudenich also had six British tanks, which caused panic whenever they appeared. The Allies gave large quantities of aid to Yudenich, who, however, complained that he was receiving insufficient support.\\r\\nBy 19 October Yudenich's troops had reached the outskirts of the city. Some members of the Bolshevik central committee in Moscow were willing to give up Petrograd, but Trotsky refused to accept the loss of the city and personally organized its defenses. Trotsky himself declared, \\"It is impossible for a little army of 15,000 ex-officers to master a working-class capital of 700,000 inhabitants.\\" He settled on a strategy of urban defense, proclaiming that the city would \\"defend itself on its own ground\\" and that the White Army would be lost in a labyrinth of fortified streets and there \\"meet its grave\\".[45]\\r\\nTrotsky armed all available workers, men and women, ordering the transfer of military forces from Moscow. Within a few weeks the Red Army defending Petrograd had tripled in size and outnumbered Yudenich three to one. At this point Yudenich, short of supplies, decided to call off the siege of the city and withdrew, repeatedly asking permission to withdraw his army across the border to Estonia. However, units retreating across the border were disarmed and interned by order of the Estonian government, which had entered into peace negotiations with the Soviet Government on 16 September and had been informed by the Soviet authorities of their 6 November decision that, should the White Army be allowed to retreat into Estonia, it would be pursued across the border by the Reds.[46] In fact, the Reds attacked Estonian army positions and fighting continued until a cease-fire went into effect on 3 January 1920. Following the Treaty of Tartu most of Yudenich's soldiers went into exile. Finnish Gen. Mannerheim planned an intervention to help the Whites in Russia capture Petrograd. He did not, however, gain the necessary support for the endeavor. Lenin considered it \\"completely certain, that the slightest aid from Finland would have determined the fate of Petrograd\\".\\r\\nThe British occupied Murmansk and, alongside the Americans, seized Arkhangelsk. With the retreat of Kolchak in Siberia, they pulled their troops out of the cities before the winter trapped them in the port. The remaining White forces under Yevgenii Miller evacuated the region in February 1920.\\r\\nAt the beginning of March 1919 the general offensive of the Whites on the eastern front began. Ufa was retaken on 13 March; by mid-April, the White Army stopped at the GlazovÿChistopolÿBugulmaÿBuguruslanÿSharlyk line. Reds started their counteroffensive against Kolchak's forces at the end of April. The Red Army, led by the capable commander Tukhachevsky, captured Elabuga on 26 May, Sarapul on 2 June and Izevsk on the 7th and continued to push forward. Both sides had victories and losses, but by the middle of summer the Red Army was larger than the White Army and had managed to recapture territory previously lost.\\r\\nFollowing the abortive offensive at Chelyabinsk, the White armies withdrew beyond the Tobol. In September 1919 a White offensive was launched against the Tobol front, the last attempt to change the course of events. However, on 14 October the Reds counterattacked, and thus began the uninterrupted retreat of the Whites to the east.\\r\\nOn 14 November 1919 the Red Army captured Omsk.[47] Adm. Kolchak lost control of his government shortly after this defeat; White Army forces in Siberia essentially ceased to exist by December. Retreat of the eastern front by White armies lasted three months, until mid-February 1920, when the survivors, after crossing Lake Baikal, reached Chita area and joined Ataman Semenov's forces.\\r\\nThe Cossacks had been unable to organize and capitalize on their successes at the end of 1918. By 1919 they had begun to run short of supplies. Consequently, when the Soviet counteroffensive began in January 1919 under the Bolshevik leader Antonov-Ovseenko, the Cossack forces rapidly fell apart. The Red Army captured Kiev on 3 February 1919.\\r\\nGen. Denikin's military strength continued to grow in the spring of 1919. During several months in winter and spring of 1919, hard fighting with doubtful outcomes took place in the Donbass, where the attacking Bolsheviks met White forces. At the same time Denikin's Armed Forces of South Russia (AFSR) completed the elimination of Red forces in the northern Caucasus and advanced towards Tsaritsyn. At the end of April and beginning of May the AFSR attacked on all fronts from the Dnepr to the Volga, and by the beginning of the summer they had won numerous battles. French forces landed in Odessa but, after having done almost no fighting, withdrew on 8 April 1919. By mid-June the Reds were chased from the Crimea and the Odessa area. Denikin's troops took the cities of Kharkov and Belgorod. At the same time White troops under Wrangel's command took Tsaritsyn on 17 June 1919. On 20 June Denikin issued his famous \\"Moscow directive\\", ordering all AFSR units to get ready for a decisive offensive to take Moscow.\\r\\nAlthough Great Britain had withdrawn its own troops from the theater, it continued to give significant military aid (money, weapons, food, ammunition and some military advisors) to the White Armies during 1919. Major Ewen Cameron Bruce of the British Army had volunteered to command a British tank mission assisting the White Army. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order[48] for his bravery during the June 1919 battle of Tsaritsyn for single-handedly storming and capturing the fortified city of Tsaritsyn, under heavy shell fire in a single tank; this led to the successful capture of over 40,000 prisoners.[49] The fall of Tsaritsyn is viewed \\"as one of the key battles of the Russian Civil War\\" which greatly helped the White Russian Cause.[49] Notable historian Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart comments that Bruce's tank action during this battle is to be seen as \\"one of the most remarkable feats in the whole history of the Tank Corps\\".[50]\\r\\nAfter the capture of Tsaritsyn, Wrangel pushed towards Saratov but Trotsky, seeing the danger of the union with Kolchak, against whom the Red command was concentrating large masses of troops, repulsed his attempts with heavy losses. When Kolchak's army in the east began to retreat in June and July, the bulk of the Red Army, free now from any serious danger from Siberia, was directed against Denikin.\\r\\nDenikin's forces constituted a real threat and for a time threatened to reach Moscow. The Red Army, stretched thin by fighting on all fronts, was forced out of Kiev on 30 August. Kursk and Orel were taken. The Cossack Don Army under the command of Gen. Konstantin Mamontov continued north towards Voronezh, but there Tukhachevsky's army defeated them on 24 October. Tukhachevsky's army then turned towards yet another threat, the rebuilt Volunteer Army of Gen. Denikin.\\r\\nThe high tide of the White movement against the Soviets had been reached in September 1919. By this time Denikin's forces were dangerously overextended. The White front had no depth or stabilityit had become a series of patrols with occasional columns of slowly advancing troops without reserves. Lacking ammunition, artillery and fresh reinforcements, Denikin's army was decisively defeated in a series of battles in October and November 1919. The Red Army recaptured Kiev on 17 December and the defeated Cossacks fled back towards the Black Sea.\\r\\nWhile the White armies were being routed in the center and the east, they had succeeded in driving Nestor Makhno's anarchist Black Army (formally known as the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine) out of part of southern Ukraine and the Crimea. Despite this setback, Moscow was loath to aid Makhno and the Black Army and refused to provide arms to anarchist forces in Ukraine. The main body of White forces, the Volunteers and the Don Army, pulled back towards the Don, to Rostov. The smaller body (Kiev and Odessa troops) withdrew to Odessa and the Crimea, which it had managed to protect from the Bolsheviks during the winter of 1919ÿ1920.\\r\\nBy February 1919 the British government had pulled its military forces out of Central Asia.[51] Despite this success for the Red Army, the White Armys assaults in European Russia and other areas broke communication between Moscow and Tashkent. For a time Central Asia was completely cut off from Red Army forces in Siberia.[52] Although this communication failure weakened the Red Army, the Bolsheviks continued their efforts to gain support for the Bolshevik Party in Central Asia by holding a second regional conference in March. During this conference a regional bureau of Muslim organizations of the Russian Bolshevik Party was formed. The Bolshevik Party continued to try to gain support among the native population by giving them the impression of better representation for the Central Asian population and throughout the end of the year were able to maintain harmony with the Central Asian people.[53]\\r\\nCommunication difficulties with Red Army forces in Siberia and European Russia ceased to be a problem by mid-November 1919. Due to Red Army successes north of Central Asia, communication with Moscow was re-established and the Bolsheviks were able to claim victory over the White Army in Turkestan.[52]\\r\\nBy the beginning of 1920 the main body of the Armed Forces of South Russia was rapidly retreating towards the Don, to Rostov. Denikin hoped to hold the crossings of the Don, then rest and reform his troops, but the White Army was not able to hold the Don area and at the end of February 1920, started a retreat across Kuban towards Novorossiysk. Slipshod evacuation of Novorossiysk proved to be a dark event for the White Army. About 40,000 men were evacuated by Russian and Allied ships from Novorossiysk to the Crimea, without horses or any heavy equipment, while about 20,000 men were left behind and either dispersed or captured by the Red Army. Following the disastrous Novorossiysk evacuation, Denikin stepped down and the military council elected Wrangel as the new Commander-in-Chief of the White Army. He was able to restore order to the dispirited troops and reshape an army that could fight as a regular force again. This remained an organized force in the Crimea throughout 1920.\\r\\nAfter Moscow's Bolshevik government signed a military and political alliance with Nestor Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists, the Black Army attacked and defeated several regiments of Wrangel's troops in southern Ukraine, forcing him to retreat before he could capture that year's grain harvest.[54] Stymied in his efforts to consolidate his hold, Wrangel then attacked north in an attempt to take advantage of recent Red Army defeats at the close of the PolishÿSoviet War of 1919ÿ1920. This offensive was eventually halted by the Red Army, and Wrangel's troops were forced to retreat to the Crimea in November 1920 pursued by both the Red and Black cavalry and infantry. Wrangel and the remains of his army were evacuated from the Crimea to Constantinople on 14 November 1920. Thus ended the struggle of Reds and Whites in Southern Russia.\\r\\nAfter the defeat of Wrangel, the Red Army immediately repudiated its 1920 treaty of alliance with Nestor Makhno and attacked the anarchist Black Army; the campaign to liquidate Makhno and the Ukrainian anarchists began with an attempted assassination of Makhno by Cheka agents. Angered by continued repression by the Bolshevik Communist government and its liberal use of the Cheka to put down anarchist elements, a naval mutiny erupted at Kronstadt, followed by peasant revolts. Red Army attacks on the anarchist forces and their sympathizers increased in ferocity throughout 1921.\\r\\nIn Siberia, Adm. Kolchak's army had disintegrated. He himself gave up command after the loss of Omsk and designated Gen. Grigory Semyonov as the new leader of the White Army in Siberia. Not long after this Kolchak was arrested by the disaffected Czechoslovak Corps as he traveled towards Irkutsk without the protection of the army, and turned over to the socialist Political Centre in Irkutsk. Six days later this regime was replaced by a Bolshevik-dominated Military-Revolutionary Committee. On 6ÿ7 February Kolchak and his prime minister Victor Pepelyaev were shot and their bodies thrown through the ice of the frozen Angara River, just before the arrival of the White Army in the area.[55]\\r\\nRemnants of Kolchak's army reached Transbaikalia and joined Semyonov's troops, forming the Far Eastern army. With the support of the Japanese army it was able to hold Chita, but after withdrawal of Japanese soldiers from Transbaikalia, Semenov's position became untenable, and in November 1920 he was driven by the Red Army from Transbaikalia and took refuge in China. The Japanese, who had plans to annex the Amur Krai, finally pulled their troops out as Bolshevik forces gradually asserted control over the Russian Far East. On 25 October 1922 Vladivostok fell to the Red Army, and the Provisional Priamur Government was extinguished.\\r\\nIn central Asia Red Army troops continued to face resistance into 1923, where basmachi (armed bands of Islamic guerrillas) had formed to fight the Bolshevik takeover. The Soviets engaged non-Russian peoples in Central Asia, like Magaza Masanchi, commander of the Dungan Cavalry Regiment, to fight against the Basmachis. The Communist Party did not completely dismantle this group until 1934.[56]\\r\\nGen. Anatoly Pepelyayev continued armed resistance in the Ayano-Maysky District until June 1923. The regions of Kamchatka and Northern Sakhalin remained under Japanese occupation until their treaty with the Soviet Union in 1925, when their forces were finally withdrawn.\\r\\nThe results of the civil war were momentous. Soviet demographer Boris Urlanis estimated the total number of men killed in action in the Civil War and PolishÿSoviet War as 300,000 (125,000 in the Red Army, 175,500 White armies and Poles) and the total number of military personnel dead from disease (on both sides) as 450,000.[57]\\r\\nDuring the Red Terror, estimates of Cheka executions range from 12,733 to 1.7 million. William Henry Chamberlin suspected that there were about 50,000.[58] Evan Mawdsley suspected that there were more than 12,733, and less than 200,000.[59] Some sources claimed at least 250,000 summary executions of \\"enemies of the people\\" with estimates reaching above a million.[60][61][62][63] More modest estimates put the numbers executed by the Bolsheviks between December 1917 and February 1922 at around 28,000 per year, with roughly 10,000 executions during the Red Terror.[64]\\r\\nSome 300,000ÿ500,000 Cossacks were killed or deported during decossackization, out of a population of around three million.[65] An estimated 100,000 Jews were killed in Ukraine, mostly by the White Army.[66] Punitive organs of the All Great Don Cossack Host sentenced 25,000 people to death between May 1918 and January 1919.[67] Kolchak's government shot 25,000 people in Ekaterinburg province alone.[68] \\"White terror\\" has killed about 300,000 people in total.[69]\\r\\nAt the end of the Civil War the Russian SFSR was exhausted and near ruin. The droughts of 1920 and 1921, as well as the 1921 famine, worsened the disaster still further. Disease had reached pandemic proportions, with 3,000,000 dying of typhus alone in 1920. Millions more also died of widespread starvation, wholesale massacres by both sides and pogroms against Jews in Ukraine and southern Russia. By 1922 there were at least 7,000,000 street children in Russia as a result of nearly ten years of devastation from the Great War and the civil war.[70]\\r\\nAnother one to two million people, known as the White migrs, fled Russia, many with Gen. Wrangelsome through the Far East, others west into the newly independent Baltic countries. These migrs included a large percentage of the educated and skilled population of Russia.\\r\\nThe Russian economy was devastated by the war, with factories and bridges destroyed, cattle and raw materials pillaged, mines flooded and machines damaged. The industrial production value descended to one-seventh of the value of 1913 and agriculture to one-third. According to Pravda, \\"The workers of the towns and some of the villages choke in the throes of hunger. The railways barely crawl. The houses are crumbling. The towns are full of refuse. Epidemics spread and death strikesindustry is ruined.\\"[citation needed] It is estimated that the total output of mines and factories in 1921 had fallen to 20% of the pre-World War level, and many crucial items experienced an even more drastic decline. For example, cotton production fell to 5%, and iron to 2%, of pre-war levels.\\r\\nWar Communism saved the Soviet government during the Civil War, but much of the Russian economy had ground to a standstill. The peasants responded to requisitions by refusing to till the land. By 1921 cultivated land had shrunk to 62% of the pre-war area, and the harvest yield was only about 37% of normal. The number of horses declined from 35 million in 1916 to 24 million in 1920 and cattle from 58 to 37 million. The exchange rate with the US dollar declined from two rubles in 1914 to 1,200 in 1920.\\r\\nWith the end of the war the Communist Party no longer faced an acute military threat to its existence and power. However, the perceived threat of another intervention, combined with the failure of socialist revolutions in other countriesmost notably the German Revolutioncontributed to the continued militarization of Soviet society. Although Russia experienced extremely rapid[citation needed] economic growth in the 1930s, the combined effect of World War I and the Civil War left a lasting scar on Russian society and had permanent effects on the development of the Soviet Union.\\r\\nBritish historian Orlando Figes has contended that the root of the Whites' defeat was their inability to dispel the popular image that they were dually associated with Tsarist Russia and supportive of a Tsarist restoration.[71]","input":"Who was fighting in the russian civil war?"},{"output":"Burj Khalifa","context":"This list of tallest buildings in the world ranks skyscrapers by height. Only buildings with continuously occupiable floors are included, thus non-building structures, including towers, are not included. (See List of tallest buildings and structures.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \\"The World's Tallest Building\\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[3] The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828?m (2,717?ft).[3] The CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, however, and some buildings listed within these list articles are not considered complete by the CTBUH.\\r\\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller,[4] the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\\r\\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, to which changes would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.\\r\\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building employed only a short spire and was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\\r\\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor. They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (100 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.[6]\\r\\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.[7][8]\\r\\nAs of 2017, this list includes all 51 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of 350 metres (1,148?ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the twin towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 24 and 25 on the list (or 23 and 24 since it can be assumed One World Trade Center would have never been built).\\r\\nBurj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, is the world's tallest building.\\r\\nShanghai Tower in Shanghai, China, is the 2nd tallest building.\\r\\nThe Abraj Al-Bait Towers in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is the 3rd tallest building.\\r\\nPing An Finance Centre, in Guangdong, China, is the 4th tallest building.\\r\\nLotte World Tower in Seoul, South Korea, is the 5th tallest building.\\r\\nOne World Trade Center in New York City, is the 6th tallest building and the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.\\r\\nCTF Finance Centre in Guangzhou, China, is the 7th tallest building.\\r\\nTaipei 101 in Taipei, Taiwan, was the world's tallest building from 2004 to 2010; it is now 8th.\\r\\nThe Shanghai World Financial Center is the 9th tallest building and the 3rd tallest in China.\\r\\nThe International Commerce Centre in Hong Kong, is currently the 10th tallest building.\\r\\nThe Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were the tallest buildings from 1998 to 2004, and are still the tallest twin buildings.\\r\\nWillis Tower, formerly Sears Tower, in Chicago, United States, was the tallest building from 1974 to 1998.\\r\\nNew York City's Empire State Building was the tallest building from 1931 to 1972, and is the 5th tallest building in the United States.\\r\\nJin Mao Tower in Shanghai, China is the 10th tallest building in China.\\r\\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\\r\\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now called Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\\r\\nThis is a list of buildings taller than 350 metres that are currently under construction.

Until the 1980s, the sole legal and administrative criterion for inclusion in this category was race, classified according to visible physical characteristics or known ancestors. As in the British slave colonies of North America and the Caribbean, where the principle of partus sequitur ventrem was adopted from 1662, children's status was determined by that of their mothers: if born to Aboriginal mothers, children were considered Aboriginal, regardless of their paternity.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the era of colonial and post-colonial government, access to basic human rights depended upon your race. If you were a \\"full blooded Aboriginal native ... [or] any person apparently having an admixture of Aboriginal blood\\", a half-caste being the \\"offspring of an Aboriginal mother and other than Aboriginal father\\" (but not of an Aboriginal father and other than Aboriginal mother), a \\"quadroon\\", or had a \\"strain\\" of Aboriginal blood you were forced to live on Reserves or Missions, work for rations, given minimal education, and needed governmental approval to marry, visit relatives or use electrical appliances.[9]\\r\\nThe Constitution of Australia, in its original form as of 1901, referred to Aboriginals twice, but without definition. Section 51(xxvi) gave the Commonwealth parliament a power to legislate with respect to \\"the people of any race\\" throughout the Commonwealth, except for people of \\"the aboriginal race\\". The purpose of this provision was to give the Commonwealth power to regulate non-white immigrant workers, who would follow work opportunities interstate.[10] The only other reference, Section 127, provided that \\"aboriginal natives shall not be counted\\" in reckoning the size of the population of the Commonwealth or any part of it. The purpose of Section 127 was to prevent the inclusion of Aboriginal people in Section 24 determinations of the distribution of House of Representatives seats amongst the states and territories.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter these references were removed by the 1967 referendum, the Australian Constitution had no references to Aboriginals. Since that time, there have been a number of proposals to amend the constitution to specifically mention Indigenous Australians.[12][13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change to Section 51(xxvi) enabled the Commonwealth parliament to enact laws specifically with respect to Aboriginal peoples as a \\"race\\". In the Tasmanian Dam Case of 1983, the High Court of Australia was asked to determine whether Commonwealth legislation, whose application could relate to Aboriginal peopleparts of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 (Cth) as well as related legislationwas supported by Section 51(xxvi) in its new form. The case concerned an application of legislation that would preserve cultural heritage of Aboriginal Tasmanians. It was held that Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders, together or separately, and any part of either, could be regarded as a \\"race\\" for this purpose. As to the criteria for identifying a person as a member of such a \\"race\\", the definition by Justice Deane has become accepted as current law.[9] Deane said:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is unnecessary, for the purposes of the present case, to consider the meaning to be given to the phrase \\"people of any race\\" in s. 51(xxvi). Plainly, the words have a wide and non-technical meaning ... . The phrase is, in my view, apposite to refer to all Australian Aboriginals collectively. Any doubt, which might otherwise exist in that regard, is removed by reference to the wording of par. (xxvi) in its original form. The phrase is also apposite to refer to any identifiable racial sub-group among Australian Aboriginals. By \\"Australian Aboriginal\\" I mean, in accordance with what I understand to be the conventional meaning of that term, a person of Aboriginal descent, albeit mixed, who identifies himself as such and who is recognised by the Aboriginal community as an Aboriginal.[14]\\r\\nWhile Deane's three-part definition reaches beyond the biological criterion to an individual's self-identification, it has been criticised as continuing to accept the biological criterion as primary.[9] It has been found difficult to apply, both in each of its parts and as to the relations among the parts; biological \\"descent\\" has been a fall-back criterion.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nEve Fesl, a Gabi-Gabi woman, wrote in the Aboriginal Law Bulletin describing how she and possibly other Aboriginal people preferred to be identified:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word 'aborigine' refers to an indigenous person of any country. If it is to be used to refer to us as a specific group of people, it should be spelt with a capital 'A', i.e., 'Aborigine'.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the term 'indigenous' is being more commonly used by Australian Government and non-Government organisations to describe Aboriginal Australians, Lowitja O'Donoghue, commenting on the prospect of possible amendments to Australia's constitution, said:\\r\\n\\r\\nI really can't tell you of a time when 'indigenous' became current, but I personally have an objection to it, and so do many other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. ... This has just really crept up on us ... like thieves in the night. ... We are very happy with our involvement with indigenous people around the world, on the international forum ... because they're our brothers and sisters. But we do object to it being used here in Australia.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nO'Donoghue said that the term indigenous robbed the traditional owners of Australia of an identity because some non-Aboriginal people now wanted to refer to themselves as indigenous because they were born there.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nDean of Indigenous Research and Education at Charles Darwin University, Professor MaryAnn Bin-Sallik, has lectured on the ways Aboriginal Australians have been categorised and labelled over time. Her lecture offered a new perspective on the terms urban, traditional and of Indigenous descent as used to define and categorise Aboriginal Australians:\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only are these categories inappropriate, they serve to divide us. ... Government's insistence on categorising us with modern words like 'urban', 'traditional' and 'of Aboriginal descent' are really only replacing old terms 'half-caste' and 'full-blood'?ÿ based on our colouring.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nShe called for a replacement of this terminology by that of \\"Aborigine\\" or \\"Torres Strait Islander\\"?ÿ \\"irrespective of hue\\".[18] It could be argued that the indigenous tribes of Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea (Indonesia) are more closely related to the Aboriginal Australians than to any tribes found in Indonesia, however due to ongoing conflict in the regions of West Papua, these tribes are being marginalized from their closest relations.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nScholars had disagreed whether the closest kin of Aboriginal Australians outside Australia were certain South Asian groups or African groups. The latter would imply a migration pattern in which their ancestors passed through South Asia to Australia without intermingling genetically with other populations along the way.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2011 genetic study by Ramussen et al., researchers took a DNA sample from an early 20th century lock of an Aboriginal person's hair with low European admixture. They found that the ancestors of the Aboriginal population split off from the Eurasian population between 62,000 and 75,000 BP, whereas the European and Asian populations split only 25,000 to 38,000 years BP, indicating an extended period of Aboriginal genetic isolation. These Aboriginal ancestors migrated into South Asia and then into Australia, where they stayed, with the result that, outside of Africa, the Aboriginal peoples have occupied the same territory continuously longer than any other human populations. These findings suggest that modern Aboriginal peoples are the direct descendants of migrants who left Africa up to 75,000 years ago.[22][23] This finding is compatible with earlier archaeological finds of human remains near Lake Mungo that date to approximately 40,000 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same genetic study of 2011 found evidence that Aboriginal peoples carry some of the genes associated with the Denisovan (a species of human related to but distinct from Neanderthals) peoples of Asia; the study suggests that there is an increase in allele sharing between the Denisovans and the Aboriginal Australians genome compared to other Eurasians and Africans. Examining DNA from a finger bone excavated in Siberia, researchers concluded that the Denisovans migrated from Siberia to tropical parts of Asia and that they interbred with modern humans in South-East Asia 44,000 years ago, before Australia separated from Papua New Guinea approximately 11,700 years BP. They contributed DNA to Aboriginal Australians along with present-day New Guineans and an indigenous tribe in the Philippines known as Mamanwa.[citation needed] This study makes Aboriginal Australians one of the oldest living populations in the world and possibly the oldest outside of Africa, confirming they may also have the oldest continuous culture on the planet.[24] The Papuans have more sharing alleles than Aboriginal peoples.[clarification needed] The data suggest that modern and archaic humans interbred in Asia before the migration to Australia.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne 2017 paper in Nature evaluated artifacts in Kakadu and concluded \\"Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago\\".[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2013 study by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology found that there was a migration of genes from India to Australia around 2000 BCE. The researchers had two theories for this: either some Indians had contact with people in Indonesia who eventually transferred those genes from India to Australian Aborigines, or that a group of Indians migrated all the way from India to Australia and intermingled with the locals directly. Their research also shows that these new arrivals came at a time when dingoes first appeared in the fossil record, and when Aboriginal peoples first used microliths in hunting. In addition, they arrived just as one of the Aboriginal language groups was undergoing a rapid expansion.[27][28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a 2001 study, blood samples were collected from some Warlpiri members of the Northern Territory to study the genetic makeup of the Warlpiri Tribe of Aboriginal Australians, who are not representative of all Aboriginal Tribes in Australia. The study concluded that the Warlpiri are descended from ancient Asians whose DNA is still somewhat present in Southeastern Asian groups, although greatly diminished. The Warlpiri DNA also lacks certain information found in modern Asian genomes, and carries information not found in other genomes, reinforcing the idea of ancient Aboriginal isolation.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal Australians are genetically most similar to the indigenous populations of Papua New Guinea, and more distantly related to groups from south India. They are quite distinct from the indigenous populations of Borneo and Malaysia, sharing relatively little genomic information as compared to the groups from Papua New Guinea and India. This indicates that Australia was isolated for a long time from the rest of Southeast Asia, and remained untouched by migrations and population expansions into that area.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Australian Aborigines are genetically evolved to stand a wide range of environmental temperatures. They were observed to have been able to sleep naked on the ground at night in below freezing conditions in desert conditions where the temperatures easily rose to above 40 degrees Celsius during the day. By the same token, Tasmanian Aborigines would sleep in snow drifts with nothing on apart from an animal skin. According to the April 2017 edition of the National Geographic magazine, it is believed that this ability of Australian Aborigines is due to a beneficial mutation in the genes which regulate hormones that control body temperature.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal Australians have disproportionately high rates[31] of severe physical disability, as much as three times that of non-Aboriginal Australians, possibly due to higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and kidney disease. In a study comparing Aboriginal Australians to non-Aboriginal Australians, obesity and smoking rates were higher among Aboriginals, which are contributing factors or causes of serious health issues. The study also showed that Aboriginal Australians were more likely to self-report their health as \\"excellent/very good\\" in spite of extant severe physical limitations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn article on 20 January 2017 in The Lancet describes the suicide rate among Aboriginal Australians as a \\"catastrophic crisis\\":\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2015, more than 150 [Aborigines] died by suicide, the highest figure ever recorded nationally and double the rate of [non-Aborigines], according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Additionally, [Aboriginal] children make up one in three child suicides despite making up a minuscule percentage of the population. Moreover, in parts of the country such as Kimberley, WA, suicide rates among [Aborigines] are among the highest in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report advocates Aboriginal-led national response to the crisis, asserting that suicide prevention programmes have failed this segment of the population.[32] The ex-prisoner population of Australian Aboriginals is particularly at risk of committing suicide; organisations such as Ngalla Maya have been set up to offer assistance.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne study reports that Aboriginal Australians are significantly affected by infectious diseases, particularly in rural areas.[34] These diseases include strongyloidiasis, hookworm caused by Ancylostoma duodenale, scabies, and streptococcal infections. Because poverty is also prevalent in Aboriginal populations, the need for medical assistance is even greater in many Aboriginal Australian communities. The researchers suggested the use of mass drug administration (MDA) as a method of combating the diseases found commonly among Aboriginal peoples, while also highlighting the importance of \\"sanitation, access to clean water, good food, integrated vector control and management, childhood immunizations, and personal and family hygiene\\".[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother study examining the psychosocial functioning of high-risk-exposed and low-risk-exposed Aboriginal Australians aged 12ÿ17 found that in high-risk youths, personal well-being was protected by a sense of solidarity and common low socioeconomic status. However, in low-risk youths, perceptions of racism caused poor psychosocial functioning. The researchers suggested that factors such as racism, discrimination and alienation contributed to physiological health risks in ethnic minority families. The study also mentioned the effect of poverty on Aboriginal populations: higher morbidity and mortality rates.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAboriginal Australians suffer from high rates of heart disease. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and among Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal people develop atrial fibrillation, a condition that sharply increases the risk of stroke, much earlier than non-Aboriginal Australians on average. The life expectancy for Aboriginal Australians is 10 years lower than non-Aboriginal Australians. Technologies such as the Wireless ambulatory ECG are being developed to screen at-risk individuals, particularly rural Australians, for atrial fibrillation.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe incidence rate of cancer was lower in Aboriginal Australians than non-Aboriginal Australians in 2005ÿ2009.[37] However, some cancers, including lung cancer and liver cancer, were significantly more common in Aboriginal people. The overall mortality rate of Aboriginal Australians due to cancer was 1.3 times higher than non-Aboriginals in 2013. This may be because they are less likely to receive the necessary treatments in time, or because the cancers that they tend to develop are often more lethal than other cancers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, a large number of Aboriginal Australians use tobacco, perhaps 41% of people aged 15 and up.[38] This number has declined in recent years, but remains relatively high. The smoking rate is roughly equal for men and women across all age groups, but the smoking rate is much higher in rural than in urban areas. The prevalence of smoking exacerbates existing health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The Australian government has encouraged its citizens, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, to stop smoking or to not start.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Northern Territory (which has the greatest proportion of Aboriginal Australians), per capita alcohol consumption for adults is 1.5 times the national average. Nearly half of Aboriginal adults in the Northern Territory reported alcohol usage. In addition to the inherent risks associated with alcohol use, its consumption also tends to increase domestic violence. Aboriginal people account for 60% of the facial fracture victims in the Northern Territory, though they only constitute approximately 30% of its population. Due to the complex nature of the alcohol and domestic violence issue in the Northern Territory, proposed solutions are contentious. However, there has recently been increased media attention to this problem.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nModern Aboriginal Australians living in rural areas tend to have nutritionally poor diets, where higher food costs drive people to consume cheaper, lower quality foods. The average diet is high in refined carbohydrates and salt, and low in fruit and vegetables. There are several challenges in improving diets for Aboriginal Australians, such as shorter shelf lives of fresh foods, resistance to changing existing consumption habits, and disagreements on how to implement changes. Some suggest the use of taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages to discourage their consumption, but this approach is questionable. Providing subsidies for healthy foods has proven effective in other countries, but has yet to be proven useful for Aboriginal Australians specifically.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDispersing across the Australian continent over time, the ancient people expanded and differentiated into distinct groups, each with its own language and culture.[41] More than 400 distinct Australian Aboriginal peoples have been identified, distinguished by names designating their ancestral languages, dialects, or distinctive speech patterns.[42] Historically, these groups lived in three main cultural areas, the Northern, Southern, and Central cultural areas. The Northern and Southern areas, having richer natural marine and woodland resources, were more densely populated than the Central area.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various other names from Australian Aboriginal languages commonly used to identify groups based on geography, including:\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral Anarchists (particulary anarcho-primitivists) such as Harold Barclay and Bob Black have praised aboriginal culture as it shows the potential long-life[44], high living standards and beauty of an anarchist society.[45] Other Anarchists such as Peter Gelderloos have been critical of several aboriginal societies for their violent and patriarchal nature.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfrica\\r\\n\\r\\nAsia\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\n\\r\\nNorth America\\r\\n\\r\\nOceania\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth America","input":"What does it mean to be an aboriginal australian?"},{"output":"28 June 1919","context":"","input":"When did germany signed the treaty of versailles?"},{"output":"March 3, 1849","context":"The United States Department of the Interior (DOI) is the United States federal executive department of the U.S. government responsible for the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources, and the administration of programs relating to Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, territorial affairs, and insular areas of the United States. About 75% of federal public land is managed by the department, with most of the remainder managed by the United States Department of Agriculture's United States Forest Service.[3]\\r\\nThe Department is administered by the United States Secretary of the Interior, who is a member of the Cabinet of the President. The current Secretary is Ryan Zinke. The Inspector General position is currently vacant, with Mary Kendall serving as acting Inspector General.[4][5]\\r\\nDespite its name, the Department of the Interior has a different role from that of the interior ministries of other nations, which are usually responsible for police matters and internal security. In the United States, national security and immigration functions are performed by the Department of Homeland Security primarily and the Department of Justice secondarily.\\r\\nThe Department of the Interior has often been humorously called \\"The Department of Everything Else\\" because of its broad range of responsibilities.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA department for domestic concern was first considered by the 1st United States Congress in 1789, but those duties were placed in the Department of State. The idea of a separate domestic department continued to percolate for a half-century and was supported by Presidents from James Madison to James Polk. The 1846ÿ48 MexicanÿAmerican War gave the proposal new steam as the responsibilities of the federal government grew. Polk's Secretary of the Treasury, Robert J. Walker, became a vocal champion of creating the new department.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn 1849, Walker stated in his annual report that several federal offices were placed in departments with which they had little to do. He noted that the General Land Office had little to do with the Treasury and also highlighted the Indian Affairs office, part of the Department of War, and the Patent Office, part of the Department of State. Walker argued that these and other bureaus should be brought together in a new Department of the Interior.[citation needed] A bill authorizing its creation of the Department passed the House of Representatives on February 15, 1849, and spent just over two weeks in the Senate. The Department was established on March 3, 1849 (9?Stat.?395), the eve of President Zachary Taylor's inauguration, when the Senate voted 31 to 25 to create the Department. Its passage was delayed by Democrats in Congress who were reluctant to create more patronage posts for the incoming Whig administration to fill. The first Secretary of the Interior was Thomas Ewing.\\r\\nMany of the domestic concerns the Department originally dealt with were gradually transferred to other Departments. Other agencies became separate Departments, such as the Bureau of Agriculture, which later became the Department of Agriculture. However, land and natural resource management, American Indian affairs, wildlife conservation, and territorial affairs remain the responsibilities of the Department of the Interior.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs of mid-2004, the Department managed 507 million acres (2,050,000?km2) of surface land, or about one-fifth of the land in the United States. It manages 476 dams and 348 reservoirs through the Bureau of Reclamation, 410 national parks, monuments, seashore sites, etc. through the National Park Service, and 544 national wildlife refuges through the Fish and Wildlife Service. Energy projects on federally managed lands and offshore areas supply about 28% of the nation's energy production.[citation needed]\\r\\nWithin the Interior Department, the Bureau of Indian Affairs handles some federal relations with Native Americans, while others are handled by the Office of Special Trustee. The current acting Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is Lawrence S. Roberts, an enrolled member of the Oneida Tribe in Wisconsin.\\r\\nThe Department has been the subject of disputes over proper accounting for Native American Trusts set up to track the income and distribution of monies that are generated by the Trust and specific Native American lands, which the government leases for fees to companies that extract oil, timber, minerals, and other resources. Several cases have sought an accounting of such funds from departments within the Interior and Treasury (such as the Minerals Management Service), in what has been a 15-year-old lawsuit. Some Native American nations have also sued the government over water-rights issues and their treaties with the US. In 2010 Congress passed the Claims Settlement Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-291), which provided $3.4 billion for the settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar class-action trust case and four Native American water rights cases.[7]\\r\\nThe $3.4 billion will be placed in a still-to-be-selected bank and $1.4 billion will go to individuals, mostly in the form of checks ranging from $500 to $1,500. A small group, such as members of the Osage tribe who benefit from huge Oklahoma oil revenues, will get far more, based on a formula incorporating their 10 highest years of income between 1985 and 2009. As important, $2 billion will be used to buy trust land from Native American owners at fair market prices, with the government finally returning the land to tribes. Nobody can be forced to sell.[8]\\r\\nSecretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall was implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal of 1921. He was convicted of bribery in 1929, and served one year in prison, for his part in the controversy. A major factor in the scandal was a transfer of certain oil leases from the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy to that of the Department of the Interior, at Fall's behest.\\r\\nSecretary of the Interior James G. Wattalready facing criticism related to his alleged hostility to environmentalism and his support of the development and use of federal lands by foresting, ranching, and other commercial interests, and for banning The Beach Boys from playing a 1983 Independence Day concert on the National Mall out of concerns of attracting \\"an undesirable element\\"resigned abruptly after a September 21, 1983, speech in which he said about his staff: \\"I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.\\"[9] Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his resignation letter.[9][10]\\r\\nUnder the Administration of President George W. Bush, the Interior Department's maintenance backlog climbed from $5 billion to $8.7 billion, despite Bush's campaign pledges to eliminate it completely. Of the agency under Bush's leadership, Interior Department Inspector General Earl Devaney has cited a \\"culture of fear\\" and of \\"ethical failure.\\" Devaney has also said, \\"Simply stated, short of a crime, anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of Interior.\\"[11]","input":"When was the department of the interior formed?"},{"output":"a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without relying on meaningful content","context":"In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document without relying on meaningful content (also called greeking).

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?\\r\\n[33] On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse.\\r\\nOccasionally used by printers as dummy texts since the 1500s, use of Lorem ipsum passages was first popularized on Letraset dry-transfer sheets from the early 1970s, which were produced to be used by graphic designers for filler text.[4][2]\\r\\nA version of lorem ipsum was created in the mid-1980s for Aldus Corporation's desktop publishing program PageMaker.[2]\\r\\nNowadays a variety of software, including text and plug-ins, can generate[6] semi-random \\"lorem-like text\\", which often has little or nothing in common with the canonical adaptations other than looking like (and often being) jumbled Latin.

In Catch-22, Yossarian is a 28-year-old Captain and B-25 bombardier in the 256th Bombardment Squadron of the Army Air Corps, stationed on the small island of Pianosa off the Italian mainland during World War II. Yossarian's exploits are based on the experiences of the author; Heller was also a bombardier in the Air Corps, stationed on an island off the coast of Italy during World War II.\\r\\n\\r\\nTappman (also called R. O. Shipman in some editions) is a na?ve Anabaptist minister from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who is tormented throughout the novel by his rude, manipulative atheist assistant, Corporal Whitcomb.

As such, he does whatever it takes to please his superiors, in particular, by repeatedly raising the number of missions the men have to fly to complete a tour of duty beyond that normally required by other outfits. This becomes the bane of Yossarian's life, as every time he comes close to obtaining the target number of missions for being sent home, Colonel Cathcart raises the number again.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Dan Daneeka is the squadron flight surgeon and a friend of the novel's protagonist, Yossarian. Doc Daneeka's main motivation is for his own welfare, whether that be making money or protecting his own life. He generally forgets his moral duty as a physician except in the most extreme of circumstances. Doc Daneeka feels the military is responsible for him being drafted into the war effort and putting him in harm's way, because they were distrustful of him when he lied on his drafting papers about his health. He is constantly scared of upsetting his superiors who may see fit to then ship him off to the far more dangerous South Pacific.

His most notable contribution in the book is his involvement with a whore, \\"Nately's Whore,\\" who is for the most part uninterested in him until he saves her from a sleepless night with generals and so she gets an opportunity to get some sleep. He is often filled with American optimism, shown by his desire to marry his whore and send her kid sister to a respected college in the United States.

Aarfy sees himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers, but he ends up raping and murdering the innocent maid Michaela, and when asked by Yossarian why he didn't simply hire a prostitute, repeats his common admonition that \\"Old Aarfy has never paid for it.\\" He shows no remorse for these crimes until he begins to worry that he might be brought to justice for them.","input":"Who is the main character in catch 22?"},{"output":"the third side","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn geometry, an isosceles triangle is a triangle that has two sides of equal length. Sometimes it is specified as having exactly two sides of equal length, and sometimes as having at least two sides of equal length, the latter version thus including the equilateral triangle as a special case.\\r\\nExamples of isosceles triangles include the isosceles right triangle, the golden triangle, and the faces of bipyramids and certain Catalan solids.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mathematical study of isosceles triangles dates back to ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Isosceles triangles have been used as decoration from even earlier times, and appear frequently in architecture and design, for instance in the pediments and gables of buildings.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two equal sides are called the legs and the third side is called the base of the triangle. The other dimensions of the triangle, such as its height, area, and perimeter, can be calculated by simple formulas from the lengths of the legs and base.\\r\\nEvery isosceles triangle has an axis of symmetry along the perpendicular bisector of its base. The two angles opposite the legs are equal and are always acute, so the classification of the triangle as acute, right, or obtuse depends only on the angle between its two legs.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuclid defined an isosceles triangle as a triangle with exactly two equal sides,[1] but modern treatments prefer to define isosceles triangles as having at least two equal sides. The difference between these two definitions is that the modern version makes equilateral triangles (with three equal sides) a special case of isosceles triangles.[2] A triangle that is not isosceles (having three unequal sides) is called scalene.[3]\\r\\n\\"Isosceles\\" is a compound word, made from the Greek roots \\"isos\\" (equal) and \\"skelos\\" (leg). The same word is used, for instance, for isosceles trapezoids, trapezoids with two equal sides,[4] and for isosceles sets, sets of points every three of which form an isosceles triangle.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an isosceles triangle that has exactly two equal sides, the equal sides are called legs and the third side is called the base. The angle included by the legs is called the vertex angle and the angles that have the base as one of their sides are called the base angles.[6] The vertex opposite the base is called the apex.[7] In the equilateral triangle case, since all sides are equal, any side can be called the base.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether an isosceles triangle is acute, right or obtuse depends only on the angle at its apex. In Euclidean geometry, the base angles cannot be obtuse (greater than 90) or right (equal to 90) because their measures would sum to at least 180, the total of all angles in any Euclidean triangle.[8] Since a triangle is obtuse or right if and only if one of its angles is obtuse or right, respectively, an isosceles triangle is obtuse, right or acute if and only if its apex angle is respectively obtuse, right or acute.[7] In Edwin Abbott's book Flatland, this classification of shapes was used as a satire of social hierarchy: isosceles triangles represented the working class, with acute isosceles triangles lower in the hierarchy than right or obtuse isosceles triangles.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs well as the isosceles right triangle, several other specific shapes of isosceles triangles have been studied.\\r\\nThese include the Calabi triangle (a triangle with three congruent inscribed squares),[10] the golden triangle and golden gnomon (two isosceles triangles whose sides and base are in the golden ratio),[11] the 80-80-20 triangle appearing in the Langleys Adventitious Angles puzzle,[12] and the 30-30-120 triangle of the triakis triangular tiling.\\r\\nFive Catalan solids, the triakis tetrahedron, triakis octahedron, tetrakis hexahedron, pentakis dodecahedron, and triakis icosahedron, each have isosceles-triangle faces, as do infinitely many pyramids[8] and bipyramids.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any isosceles triangle, the following six line segments coincide:\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir common length is the height \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n of the triangle.\\r\\nIf the triangle has equal sides of length \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle a}\\r\\n\\r\\n and base of length \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle b}\\r\\n\\r\\n,\\r\\nthe general triangle formulas for \\r\\nthe lengths of these segments all simplify to[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis formula can also be derived from the Pythagorean theorem using the fact that the altitude bisects the base and partitions the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Euler line of any triangle goes through the triangle's orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes), its centroid (the intersection of its three  medians), and its circumcenter (the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of its three sides, which is also the center of the circumcircle that passes through the three vertices). In an isosceles triangle with exactly two equal sides, these three points are distinct, and (by symmetry) all lie on the symmetry axis of the triangle, from which it follows that the Euler line coincides with the axis of symmetry. The incenter of the triangle also lies on the Euler line, something that is not true for other triangles.[15] If any two of an angle bisector, median, or altitude coincide in a given triangle, that triangle must be isosceles.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe area \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nT\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle T}\\r\\n\\r\\n of an isosceles triangle can be derived from the formula for its height, and from the general formula for the area of a triangle as half the product of base and height:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same area formula can also be derived from Heron's formula for the area of a triangle from its three sides.

It was formulated in 1840 by C. L. Lehmus. Its other namesake, Jakob Steiner, was one of the first to provide a solution.[28]\\r\\nAlthough originally formulated only for internal angle bisectors, it works for many (but not all) cases when, instead, two external angle bisectors are equal.\\r\\nThe 30-30-120 isosceles triangle makes a boundary case for this variation of the theorem, as it has four equal angle bisectors (two internal, two external).[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inradius and circumradius formulas for an isosceles triangle may be derived from their formulas for arbitrary triangles.[30]\\r\\nThe radius of the inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle with side length \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\na\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle a}\\r\\n\\r\\n, base \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle b}\\r\\n\\r\\n, and height \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n is:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance above the base.\\r\\nAn isosceles triangle has the largest possible inscribed circle among the triangles with the same base and apex angle, as well as also having the largest area and perimeter among the same class of triangles.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe radius of the circumscribed circle is:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe center of the circle lies on the symmetry axis of the triangle, this distance below the apex.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any isosceles triangle, there is a unique square with one side collinear with the base of the triangle and the opposite two corners on its sides. The Calabi triangle is a special isosceles triangle with the property that the other two inscribed squares, with sides collinear with the sides of the triangle,\\r\\nare of the same size as the base square.[10] A much older theorem, preserved in the works of Hero of Alexandria,\\r\\nstates that, for an isosceles triangle with base \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nb\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle b}\\r\\n\\r\\n and height \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nh\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle h}\\r\\n\\r\\n, the side length of the inscribed square on the base of the triangle is[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor any integer \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n4\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n\\\\geq 4}\\r\\n\\r\\n, any triangle can be partitioned into \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nn\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle n}\\r\\n\\r\\n isosceles triangles.[33]\\r\\nIn a right triangle, the median from the hypotenuse (that is, the line segment from the midpoint of the hypotenuse to the right-angled vertex) divides the right triangle into two isosceles triangles. This is because the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circumcircle of the right triangle, and each of the two triangles created by the partition has two equal radii as two of its sides.[34]\\r\\nSimilarly, an acute triangle can be partitioned into three isosceles triangles by segments from its circumcenter,[35] but this method does not work for obtuse triangles, because the circumcenter lies outside the triangle.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nGeneralizing the partition of an acute triangle, any cyclic polygon that contains the center of its circumscribed circle can be partitioned into isosceles triangles by the radii of this circle through its vertices. The fact that all radii of a circle have equal length implies that all of these triangles are isosceles. This partition can be used to derive a formula for the area of the polygon as a function of its side lengths, even for cyclic polygons that do not contain their circumcenters. This formula generalizes Heron's formula for triangles and Brahmagupta's formula for cyclic quadrilaterals.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nEither diagonal of a rhombus divides it into two congruent isosceles triangles. Similarly, one of the two diagonals of\\r\\na kite divides it into two isosceles triangles, which are not congruent except when the kite is a rhombus.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIsosceles triangles commonly appear in architecture as the shapes of gables and pediments. In Ancient Greek architecture and its later imitations, the obtuse isosceles triangle was used; in Gothic architecture this was replaced by the acute isosceles triangle.[8]\\r\\nIn the architecture of the Middle Ages, another isosceles triangle shape became popular: the Egyptian isosceles triangle. This is an isosceles triangle that is acute, but less so than the equilateral triangle; its height is proportional to 5/8 of its base.[38] The Egyptian isosceles triangle was brought back into use in modern architecture by Dutch architect Hendrik Petrus Berlage.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nWarren truss structures, such as bridges, are commonly arranged in isosceles triangles, although sometimes vertical beams are also included for additional strength.[40]\\r\\nSurfaces tessellated by obtuse isosceles triangles can be used to form deployable structures that have two stable states: an unfolded state in which the surface expands to a cylindrical column, and a folded state in which it folds into a more compact prism shape that can be more easily transported.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn graphic design and the decorative arts, isosceles triangles have been a frequent design element in cultures around the world from at least the Early Neolithic[42] to modern times.[43] They are a common design element in flags and heraldry, appearing prominently with a vertical base, for instance, in the Flag of Guyana, or with a horizontal base in the Flag of Saint Lucia, where they form a stylized image of a mountain island.[44]\\r\\nThey also have been used in designs with religious or mystic significance, for instance in the Sri Yantra of Hindu meditational practice.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a cubic equation with real coefficients has three roots that are not all real numbers, then when these roots are plotted in the complex plane as an Argand diagram they form vertices of an isosceles triangle whose axis of symmetry coincides with the horizontal (real) axis. This is because the complex roots are complex conjugates and hence are symmetric about the real axis.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn celestial mechanics, the three-body problem has been studied in the special case that the three bodies form an isosceles triangle, because assuming that the bodies are arranged in this way reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the system without reducing it to the solved Lagrangian point case when the bodies form an equilateral triangle. The first solutions of the problem with unbounded oscillations were found in the isosceles three-body problem.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nLong before isosceles triangles were studied by the ancient Greek mathematicians, the practitioners of Ancient Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics knew how to calculate their area. Problems of this type are included in the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus and Rhind Mathematical Papyrus.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe theorem that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal appears as Proposition I.5 in Euclid.[49] This result has been called the pons asinorum (the bridge of asses) or the isosceles triangle theorem. Rival explanations for this name include the theory that it is because the diagram used by Euclid in his demonstration of the result resembles a bridge, or because this is the first difficult result in Euclid, and acts to separate those who can understand Euclid's geometry from those who cannot.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nA well known fallacy is the false proof of the statement that all triangles are isosceles. Robin Wilson credits this argument to Lewis Carroll,[51] who published it in 1899, but W. W. Rouse Ball published it in 1892 and later wrote that Carroll obtained the argument from him.[52] The fallacy is rooted in Euclid's lack of recognition of the concept of betweenness and the resulting ambiguity of inside versus outside of figures.[53]","input":"What is the base of an isosceles triangle?"},{"output":"Leonardo da Vinci","context":"The Mona Lisa (/?mo?n? ?li?s?/; Italian: Monna Lisa [?m?nna ?li?za] or La Gioconda [la d?o?konda], French: La Joconde [la ??k??d]) is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci that has been described as \\"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\\".[1] The Mona Lisa is also one of the most valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known insurance valuation in history at $100 million in 1962,[2] which is worth nearly $800 million in 2017.[3]\\r\\nThe painting is thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not have been started before 1513.[4][5][6][7] It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre Museum in Paris since 1797.[8]\\r\\nThe subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic,[9] the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, comes from a description by Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari, who wrote \\"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\\"[11][12] Mona in Italian is a polite form of address originating as \\"ma donna\\" ÿ similar to \\"Maam\\", \\"Madam\\", or \\"my lady\\" in English. This became \\"madonna\\", and its contraction \\"mona\\". The title of the painting, though traditionally spelled \\"Mona\\" (as used by Vasari[11]), is also commonly spelled in modern Italian as Monna Lisa (\\"mona\\" being a vulgarity in some Italian dialects) but this is rare in English.[citation needed]\\r\\nVasari's account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist's death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo's assistant Sala, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\\r\\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume written by the ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.[13]\\r\\nIn response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \\"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain. Unfortunately, we cannot be absolutely certain that this portrait of Lisa del Giocondo is the painting of the Louvre.\\"[14]\\r\\nThe model, Lisa del Giocondo,[15][16] was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo.[17] The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea.[18] The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means \\"jocund\\" (\\"happy\\" or \\"jovial\\") or, literally, \\"the jocund one\\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa's married name, \\"Giocondo\\".[17][19] In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning.\\r\\nBefore that discovery, scholars had developed several alternative views as to the subject of the painting. Some argued that Lisa del Giocondo was the subject of a different portrait, identifying at least four other paintings as the Mona Lisa referred to by Vasari.[20][21] Several other women have been proposed as the subject of the painting.[22] Isabella of Aragon,[23] Cecilia Gallerani,[24] Costanza d'Avalos, Duchess of Francavilla,[22] Isabella d'Este, Pacifica Brandano or Brandino, Isabela Gualanda, Caterina Sforzaeven Sala and Leonardo himselfare all among the list of posited models portrayed in the painting.[25][26] The consensus of art historians in the 21st century maintains the long-held traditional opinion, that the painting depicts Lisa del Giocondo.[13]\\r\\nLeonardo da Vinci is thought by some to have begun painting the Mona Lisa in 1503 or 1504 in Florence, Italy.[27] Although the Louvre states that it was \\"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\\",[10] the art historian Martin Kemp says there are some difficulties in confirming the actual dates with certainty.[17] In addition, many Leonardo experts, such as Carlo Pedretti [4] and Alessandro Vezzosi,[5] are of the opinion that the painting is characteristic of Leonardos style in the final years of his life, post-1513. Other academics argue that, given the historical documentation, Leonardo would have painted the work from 1513.[7] According to Leonardo's contemporary, Giorgio Vasari, \\"after he had lingered over it four years, [he] left it unfinished\\".[12] Leonardo, later in his life, is said to have regretted \\"never having completed a single work\\".[28]\\r\\nCirca 1504, Raphael executed a pen and ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns,. Experts universally agree it is based on Leonardos portrait of Mona Lisa.[29][30][6][31] Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as those in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the Mona Lisa in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut.[32][33][4][34][35] However, as early as 1993, Z?llner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed.[36] This was confirmed through a series of tests conducted in 2004.[37] In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th-century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version,[38] while Frank Z?llner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo executed another work on the subject of Mona Lisa.[36]\\r\\nIt is unclear as to who commissioned the painting. Vasari states that the work was painted for Francesco del Giocondo, the husband of Lisa del Giocondo.[39] However, Antonio de Beatis, following a visit with Leonardo in 1517, records that the painting was executed at the instance of Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici.[40]\\r\\nIn 1516, Leonardo was invited by King Fran?ois I to work at the Clos Luc near the king's castle in Amboise. It is believed that he took the Mona Lisa with him and continued to work after he moved to France.[25] Art historian Carmen C. Bambach has concluded that Leonardo probably continued refining the work until 1516 or 1517.[41]\\r\\nThe fate of the painting around Leonardos death and just after it has divided academic opinion. Some, such as Kemp, believe that upon Leonardos death, the painting was inherited with other works by his pupil and assistant Sala and was still in the latters possession in 1525.[17][42] Others believe that the painting was sold to Francis I by Sala, together with The Virgin and Child with St. Anne and the St. John the Baptist in 1518.[43] The Louvre Museum lists the painting as having entered the Royal collection in 1518.[44]\\r\\nGiven the issue surrounding the dating of the painting, the presence of the flanking columns in the Raphael sketch, the uncertainty concerning the person who commissioned it and its fate around the time of Leonardos death, a number of experts have argued that Leonardo painted two versions of the Mona Lisa.[31][6][45] The first would have been commissioned by Francesco del Giocondo circa 1503, had flanking columns, have been left unfinished and have been in Salais possession in 1525. The second, commissioned by Giuliano de Medici circa 1513, without the flanking columns, would have been sold by Salai to Francis I in 1518 and be the one in the Louvre today.[31][6][45]\\r\\nThe painting was kept at the Palace of Fontainebleau, where it remained until Louis XIV moved the painting to the Palace of Versailles. After the French Revolution, it was moved to the Louvre, but spent a brief period in the bedroom of Napoleon in the Tuileries Palace.\\r\\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War (1870ÿ71) it was moved from the Louvre to the Brest Arsenal.[46] During World War II, Mona Lisa was again removed from the Louvre and taken safely, first to Chateau d'Amboise, then to the Loc-Dieu Abbey and Chateau de Chambord, then finally to the Ingres Museum in Montauban.\\r\\nIn December 2015, it was reported that French scientist Pascal Cotte had found a hidden portrait underneath the surface of the painting using reflective light technology.[47] The portrait is an underlying image of a model looking off to the side.[48] Having been given access to the painting by Louvre in 2004, Cotte spent ten years using layer amplification methods to study the painting.[47] According to Cotte, the underlying image is Leonardo's original Mona Lisa.[47][49]\\r\\nHowever, this portrait does not fit with the description of the painting in the historical records: Both Vasari[11] and Gian Paolo Lomazzo[50] describe the subject as smiling; the subject in Cottes portrait displays no smile. In addition, the portrait lacks the flanking columns drawn by Raphael in his c.1504 sketch of Mona Lisa. Moreover, Cotte admits that his reconstitution had been carried out only in support of his hypotheses and should not be considered a real painting; he stresses that the images never existed.[51] Kemp is also adamant that Cottes images in no way establish the existence of a separate underlying portrait.[42]\\r\\nOn 21 August 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre.[52] The theft was not discovered until the next day, when painter Louis Broud walked into the museum and went to the Salon Carr where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years, only to find four iron pegs on the wall. Broud contacted the head of the guards, who thought the painting was being photographed for promotional purposes. A few hours later, Broud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with the photographers. The Louvre was closed for an entire week during the investigation.\\r\\nFrench poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who had once called for the Louvre to be \\"burnt down\\", came under suspicion and was arrested and imprisoned. Apollinaire implicated his friend Pablo Picasso, who was brought in for questioning. Both were later exonerated.[53][54] Two years later the thief revealed himself. Louvre employee Vincenzo Peruggia had stolen the Mona Lisa by entering the building during regular hours, hiding in a broom closet, and walking out with it hidden under his coat after the museum had closed.[19] Peruggia was an Italian patriot who believed Leonardo's painting should have been returned for display in an Italian museum.\\r\\nPeruggia may have been motivated by an associate whose copies of the original would significantly rise in value after the painting's theft. A later account suggested Eduardo de Valfierno had been the mastermind of the theft and had commissioned forger Yves Chaudron to create six copies of the painting to sell in the U.S. while the location of the original was unclear.[55] However, the original painting remained in Europe. After having kept the Mona Lisa in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was caught when he attempted to sell it to directors of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. It was exhibited in the Uffizi Gallery for over two weeks and returned to the Louvre on 4 January 1914.[56] Peruggia served six months in prison for the crime and was hailed for his patriotism in Italy.[54] Before its theft, the Mona Lisa was not widely known outside the art world. It was not until the 1860s that some critics, a thin slice of the French intelligentsia, began to hail it as a masterwork of Renaissance painting.[57]\\r\\nIn 1956, part of the painting was damaged when a vandal threw acid at it.[58] On 30 December of that year, a rock was thrown at the painting, dislodging a speck of pigment near the left elbow, later restored.[59]\\r\\nThe use of bulletproof glass has shielded the Mona Lisa from subsequent attacks. In April 1974, while the painting was on display at the Tokyo National Museum, a woman sprayed it with red paint as a protest against that museum's failure to provide access for disabled people.[60] On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a ceramic teacup purchased at the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure.[61][62] In both cases, the painting was undamaged.\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time seen as an ideal for womanhood.[63]\\r\\nThe depiction of the sitter in three-quarter profile is similar to late 15th-century works by Lorenzo di Credi and Agnolo di Domenico del Mazziere.[63] Z?llner notes that the sitter's general position can be traced back to Flemish models and that \\"in particular the vertical slices of columns at both sides of the panel had precedents in Flemish portraiture.\\"[64] Woods-Marsden cites Hans Memling's portrait of Benededetto Portinari (1487) or Italian imitations such as Sebastiano Mainardi's pendant portraits for the use of a loggia, which has the effect of mediating between the sitter and the distant landscape, a feature missing from Leonardo's earlier portrait of Ginevra de' Benci.[65]\\r\\nThe woman sits markedly upright in a \\"pozzetto\\" armchair with her arms folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft blending creates an ambiguous mood \\"mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes\\".[66]\\r\\nThe painting was one of the first portraits to depict the sitter in front of an imaginary landscape, and Leonardo was one of the first painters to use aerial perspective.[68] The enigmatic woman is portrayed seated in what appears to be an open loggia with dark pillar bases on either side. Behind her, a vast landscape recedes to icy mountains. Winding paths and a distant bridge give only the slightest indications of human presence. Leonardo has chosen to place the horizon line not at the neck, as he did with Ginevra de' Benci, but on a level with the eyes, thus linking the figure with the landscape and emphasizing the mysterious nature of the painting.[65]\\r\\nMona Lisa has no clearly visible eyebrows or eyelashes. Some researchers claim that it was common at this time for genteel women to pluck these hairs, as they were considered unsightly.[69][70] In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning.[71] Cotte discovered the painting had been reworked several times, with changes made to the size of the Mona Lisa's face and the direction of her gaze. He also found that in one layer the subject was depicted wearing numerous hairpins and a headdress adorned with pearls which was later scrubbed out and overpainted.[72]\\r\\nThere has been much speculation regarding the painting's model and landscape. For example, Leonardo probably painted his model faithfully since her beauty is not seen as being among the best, \\"even when measured by late quattrocento (15th century) or even twenty-first century standards.\\"[73] Some art historians in Eastern art, such as Yukio Yashiro, argue that the landscape in the background of the picture was influenced by Chinese paintings,[74] but this thesis has been contested for lack of clear evidence.[74]\\r\\nResearch in 2003 by Professor Margaret Livingstone of Harvard University said that Mona Lisa's smile disappears when observed with direct vision, known as foveal. Because of the way the human eye processes visual information, it is less suited to pick up shadows directly; however, peripheral vision can pick up shadows well.[75]\\r\\nResearch in 2008 by a geomorphology professor at Urbino University and an artist-photographer revealed likenesses of Mona Lisa's landscapes to some views in the Montefeltro region in the Italian provinces of Pesaro, Urbino and Rimini.[76][77]\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa has survived for more than 500 years, and an international commission convened in 1952 noted that \\"the picture is in a remarkable state of preservation.\\"[37] This is partly due to a variety of conservation treatments the painting has undergone. A detailed analysis in 1933 by Madame de Gironde revealed that earlier restorers had \\"acted with a great deal of restraint.\\"[37] Nevertheless, applications of varnish made to the painting had darkened even by the end of the 16th century, and an aggressive 1809 cleaning and revarnishing removed some of the uppermost portion of the paint layer, resulting in a washed-out appearance to the face of the figure. Despite the treatments, the Mona Lisa has been well cared for throughout its history, and although the panel's warping caused the curators \\"some worry\\",[78] the 2004ÿ05 conservation team was optimistic about the future of the work.[37]\\r\\nAt some point, the Mona Lisa was removed from its original frame. The unconstrained poplar panel warped freely with changes in humidity, and as a result, a crack developed near the top of the panel, extending down to the hairline of the figure. In the mid-18th century to early 19th century, two butterfly-shaped walnut braces were inserted into the back of the panel to a depth of about one third the thickness of the panel. This intervention was skilfully executed, and successfully stabilized the crack. Sometime between 1888 and 1905, or perhaps during the picture's theft, the upper brace fell out. A later restorer glued and lined the resulting socket and crack with cloth.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe picture is kept under strict, climate-controlled conditions in its bulletproof glass case. The humidity is maintained at 50%?I10%, and the temperature is maintained between 18 and 21?C. To compensate for fluctuations in relative humidity, the case is supplemented with a bed of silica gel treated to provide 55% relative humidity.[37]\\r\\nBecause the Mona Lisa's poplar support expands and contracts with changes in humidity, the picture has experienced some warping. In response to warping and swelling experienced during its storage during World War II, and to prepare the picture for an exhibit to honour the anniversary of Leonardo's 500th birthday, the Mona Lisa was fitted in 1951 with a flexible oak frame with beech crosspieces. This flexible frame, which is used in addition to the decorative frame described below, exerts pressure on the panel to keep it from warping further. In 1970, the beech crosspieces were switched to maple after it was found that the beechwood had been infested with insects. In 2004ÿ05, a conservation and study team replaced the maple crosspieces with sycamore ones, and an additional metal crosspiece was added for scientific measurement of the panel's warp.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Mona Lisa has had many different decorative frames in its history, owing to changes in taste over the centuries. In 1909, the Comtesse de Bhague gave the portrait its current frame,[79] a Renaissance-era work consistent with the historical period of the Mona Lisa. The edges of the painting have been trimmed at least once in its history to fit the picture into various frames, but no part of the original paint layer has been trimmed.[37]\\r\\nThe first and most extensive recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, who was responsible for restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Muse Napolon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugne Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by the crack in the panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisa's left elbow with watercolour.[37]\\r\\nIn 1977, a new insect infestation was discovered in the back of the panel as a result of crosspieces installed to keep the painting from warping. This was treated on the spot with carbon tetrachloride, and later with an ethylene oxide treatment. In 1985, the spot was again treated with carbon tetrachloride as a preventive measure.[37]\\r\\nOn 6 April 2005following a period of curatorial maintenance, recording, and analysisthe painting was moved to a new location within the museum's Salle des tats. It is displayed in a purpose-built, climate-controlled enclosure behind bulletproof glass.[80] Since 2005 the painting has been illuminated by an LED lamp, and in 2013 a new 20 watt LED lamp was installed, specially designed for this painting. The lamp has a colour rendering index up to 98, and minimizes infrared and ultraviolet radiation which could otherwise degrade the painting.[81] The renovation of the gallery where the painting now resides was financed by the Japanese broadcaster Nippon Television.[82] About 6?million people view the painting at the Louvre each year.[25]\\r\\nToday the Mona Lisa is considered the most famous painting in the world, but until the 20th century it was simply one among many highly regarded artworks.[83] Once part of King Francis I of France's collection, the Mona Lisa was among the very first artworks to be exhibited in Louvre, which became a national museum after the French Revolution. From the 19th century Leonardo began to be revered as a genius and the painting's popularity grew from the mid-19th century when French intelligentsia developed a theme that it was somehow mysterious and a representation of the femme fatale.[84] The Baedeker guide in 1878 called it \\"the most celebrated work of Leonardo in the Louvre\\",[85] but the painting was known more by the intelligentsia than the general public.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa and its subsequent return, however, was reported worldwide, leading to a massive increase in public recognition of the painting. During the 20th century it was an object for mass reproduction, merchandising, lampooning and speculation, and was claimed to have been reproduced in \\"300 paintings and 2,000 advertisements\\".[85] It has been said that the Mona Lisa was regarded as \\"just another Leonardo until early last century, when the scandal of the painting's theft from the Louvre and subsequent return kept a spotlight on it over several years.\\"[86]\\r\\nFrom December 1962 to March 1963, the French government lent it to the United States to be displayed in New York City and Washington, D.C.[87][88] It was shipped on the new liner SS France.[89] In New York an estimated 1.7 million people queued \\"in order to cast a glance at the Mona Lisa for 20 seconds or so.\\"[85] While exhibited in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the painting was almost drenched in water because of a faulty sprinkler, but the bullet-proof glass case which encased the painting protected it.[90]\\r\\nIn 1974, the painting was exhibited in Tokyo and Moscow.[91]\\r\\nIn 2014, 9.3 million people visited the Louvre.[92] Former director Henri Loyrette reckoned that \\"80?percent of the people only want to see the Mona Lisa.\\"[93]\\r\\nBefore the 1962ÿ63 tour, the painting was assessed for insurance at $100?million. The insurance was not bought. Instead, more was spent on security.[94] Adjusted for inflation using the US Consumer Price Index, $100?million in 1962 is around $782 million in 2015[95] making it, in practice, by far the most valued painting in the world.\\r\\nIn 2014 a France 24 article suggested that the painting could be sold to help ease the national debt, although it was noted that the Mona Lisa and other such art works were prohibited from being sold due to French heritage law, which states that \\"Collections held in museums that belong to public bodies are considered public property and cannot be otherwise.\\"[96]\\r\\nBefore its completion the Mona Lisa had already begun to influence contemporary Florentine painting. Raphael, who had been to Leonardo's workshop several times, promptly used elements of the portrait's composition and format in several of his works, such as Young Woman with Unicorn (c.?1506[97]), and Portrait of Maddalena Doni (c.?1506). Celebrated later paintings by Raphael, La velata (1515ÿ16) and Portrait of Baldassare Castiglione (c.?1514ÿ15), continued to borrow from Leonardo's painting. Zollner states that \\"None of Leonardo's works would exert more influence upon the evolution of the genre than the Mona Lisa. It became the definitive example of the Renaissance portrait and perhaps for this reason is seen not just as the likeness of a real person, but also as the embodiment of an ideal.\\"[98]\\r\\nEarly commentators such as Vasari and Andr Flibien praised the picture for its realism, but by the Victorian era writers began to regard the Mona Lisa as imbued with a sense of mystery and romance. In 1859 Thophile Gautier wrote that the Mona Lisa was a \\"sphinx of beauty who smiles so mysteriously\\" and that \\"Beneath the form expressed one feels a thought that is vague, infinite, inexpressible. One is moved, troubled ... repressed desires, hopes that drive one to despair, stir painfully.\\" Walter Pater's famous essay of 1869 described the sitter as \\"older than the rocks among which she sits; like the vampire, she has been dead many times, and learned the secrets of the grave; and has been a diver in the deep seas, and keeps their fallen day about her.\\"[99] By the early 20th?century some critics started to feel the painting had become a repository for subjective exegeses and theories,[100] and upon the painting's theft in 1911, Renaissance historian Bernard Berenson admitted that it had \\"simply become an incubus, and I was glad to be rid of her.\\"[100][101]\\r\\nThe avant-garde art world has made note of the undeniable fact of the Mona Lisa's popularity. Because of the painting's overwhelming stature, Dadaists and Surrealists often produce modifications and caricatures. Already in 1883, Le rire, an image of a Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, by Sapeck (Eugne Bataille), was shown at the \\"Incoherents\\" show in Paris. In 1919, Marcel Duchamp, one of the most influential modern artists, created L.H.O.O.Q., a Mona Lisa parody made by adorning a cheap reproduction with a moustache and goatee. Duchamp added an inscription, which when read out loud in French sounds like \\"Elle a chaud au cul\\" meaning: \\"she has a hot ass\\", implying the woman in the painting is in a state of sexual excitement and intended as a Freudian joke.[102] According to Rhonda R. Shearer, the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp's own face.[103]\\r\\nSalvador Dal, famous for his surrealist work, painted Self portrait as Mona Lisa in 1954.[104] In 1963 following the painting's visit to the United States, Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple Mona Lisas called Thirty are Better than One, like his works of Marilyn Monroe (Twenty-five Coloured Marilyns, 1962), Elvis Presley (1964) and Campbell's soup (1961ÿ62).[105] The Mona Lisa continues to inspire artists around the world. A French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader has created versions on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using his trademark mosaic style.[106] A collection of Mona Lisa parodies may be found on YouTube.[107] A 2014 New Yorker magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the Mona Lisa smile in an animation showing progressively maniacal smiles.\\r\\nA version of Mona Lisa known as Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince (\\"Leonardo da Vinci's handy-woman\\") held in Madrid's Museo del Prado was for centuries considered to be a work by Leonardo. However, since its restoration in 2012 it is considered to have been executed by one of Leonardo's pupils in his studio at the same time as Mona Lisa was being painted.[108] Their conclusion, based on analysis obtained after the picture underwent extensive restoration, that the painting is probably by Sala (1480ÿ1524) or by Melzi (1493ÿ1572). This has been called into question by others.[109]\\r\\nThe restored painting is from a slightly different perspective than the original Mona Lisa, leading to the speculation that it is part of the world's first stereoscopic pair.[110][111][112] However, a more recent report has demonstrated that this stereoscopic pair in fact gives no reliable stereoscopic depth.[113]\\r\\nA version of the Mona Lisa known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa and also known as the Earlier Mona Lisa was first bought by an English nobleman in 1778 and was rediscovered in 1913 by Hugh Blaker, an art connoisseur. The painting was presented to the media in 2012 by the Mona Lisa Foundation.[114] It is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The painting is claimed by a majority of experts to be mostly an original work of Leonardo dating from the early 16th century.[115][29][116][117][118][119][120][31][121][6][7][45] Other experts, including Z?llner and Kemp, deny the attribution.[122][119]\\r\\nCopy of Mona Lisa commonly attributed to Sala\\r\\nThe Prado Museum La Gioconda\\r\\nThe Isleworth Mona Lisa\\r\\n16th-century copy at the Hermitage by unknown artist\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nBibliography","input":"Who painted the famous portrait of mona lisa?"},{"output":"the Soviet Union","context":"The Russian Revolution was a pair of revolutions in Russia in 1917 which dismantled the Tsarist autocracy and led to the rise of the Soviet Union. The Russian Empire collapsed with the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II and the old regime was replaced by a provisional government during the first revolution of February 1917 (March in the Gregorian calendar; the older Julian calendar was in use in Russia at the time). Alongside it arose grassroots community assemblies (called 'soviets') which contended for authority. In the second revolution that October, the Provisional Government was toppled and all power was given to the soviets.\\r\\nThe February Revolution (March 1917) was a revolution focused around Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), the capital of Russia at that time. In the chaos, members of the Imperial parliament (the Duma) assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government which was heavily dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the noble aristocracy. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, resulting in Nicholas's abdication. The soviets, which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial working class, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule, but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of heavy military setbacks during the First World War (1914ÿ18), which left much of the Russian Army in a state of mutiny.\\r\\nA period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (\\"Ones of the Majority\\") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control.[1]\\r\\nIn the October Revolution (November in the Gregorian calendar), the Bolsheviks led an armed insurrection by workers and soldiers in Petrograd that successfully overthrew the Provisional Government, transferring all its authority to the soviets with the capital being relocated to Moscow shortly thereafter. The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the soviets and, as the now supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist republic, practicing soviet democracy on a national and international scale. The promise to end Russias participation in the First World War was honored promptly with the Bolshevik leaders signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918. To further secure the new state, the Cheka was established which functioned as a revolutionary security service that sought to weed out and punish those considered to be \\"enemies of the people\\" in campaigns consciously modeled on similar events during the French Revolution.\\r\\nSoon after, civil war erupted among the \\"Reds\\" (Bolsheviks), the \\"Whites\\" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements and the non-Bolshevik socialists. It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists and thereafter reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party. In this way, the Revolution paved the way for the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922. While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there was also a visible movement in cities throughout the state, among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905 was said to be a major factor contributing to the cause of the Revolutions of 1917. The events of Bloody Sunday triggered nationwide protests and soldier mutinies. A council of workers called the St. Petersburg Soviet was created in this chaos.[2] While the 1905 Revolution was ultimately crushed, and the leaders of the St. Petersburg Soviet were arrested, this laid the groundwork for the later Petrograd Soviet and other revolutionary movements during the leadup to 1917. The 1905 Revolution also led to the creation of a Duma (parliament), that would later form the Provisional Government following February 1917.[3]\\r\\nThe outbreak of World War I prompted general outcry directed at Tsar Nicholas II and the Romanov family. While the nation was initially caught up in a wave of nationalism, increasing numbers of defeats and poor conditions soon made the opposite true. The Tsar attempted to remedy the situation by taking personal control of the army in 1915. This proved disastrous, as the Tsar was now held personally responsible for Russia's continuing defeats and losses. In addition, the Tsarina Alexandra, left to rule in while the Tsar was commanding at the front, was German born, leading to suspicion of collusion, only exacerbated by rumors relating to her relationship with the controversial mystic Rasputin. Rasputin's influence led to disastrous ministerial appointments and corruption, resulting in a worsening of conditions within Russia. This led to general dissatisfaction with the Romanov family, and was a major factor contributing to the retaliation of the Russian Communists against the royal family.[3]\\r\\nAfter the entry of the Ottoman Empire on the side of the Central Powers in October 1914, Russia was deprived of a major trade route through the Dardanelles, which further contributed to the economic crisis, in which Russia became incapable of providing munitions to their army in the years leading to 1917. However, the problems were primarily administrative, and not industrial, as Germany was producing great amounts of munitions whilst constantly fighting on two major battlefronts.[4]\\r\\nThe conditions during the war resulted in devastating loss of morale within the Russian army, as well as the general population. This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, had been printing millions of ruble notes, and by 1917 inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916 revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation of workers in revolutionary parties.\\r\\nLiberal parties too had an increased platform to voice their complaints, as the initial fervor of the war had resulted in the Tsarist government creating a variety of political organizations. In July 1915, a Central War Industries Committee was established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist, Alexander Guchkov (1862-1936), including ten workers' representatives. The Petrograd Mensheviks agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad. All this activity gave renewed encouragement to political ambitions, and, in September 1915, a combination of Octobrists and Kadets in the Duma demanded the forming of a responsible government. The Tsar rejected these proposals.[5]\\r\\nAll these factors had given rise to a sharp loss of confidence in the regime, even within the ruling class, growing throughout the war. Early in 1916, Guchkov discussed with senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar. In December, a small group of nobles assassinated Rasputin, and in January 1917 the Tsar's uncle, Grand Duke Nicholas, was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II. None of these incidents were in themselves the immediate cause of the February Revolution, but they do help to explain why the monarchy survived only a few days after it had broken out.[5]\\r\\nMeanwhile, Socialist Revolutionary leaders in exile, many of them living in Switzerland, had been the glum spectators of the collapse of international socialist solidarity. French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts. Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia. The Mensheviks largely maintained that Russia had the right to defend herself against Germany, although Martov (a prominent Menshevik), now on the left of his group, demanded an end to the war and a settlement on the basis of national self-determination, with no annexations or indemnities.[5]\\r\\nIt was these views of Martov that predominated in a manifesto drawn up by Leon Trotsky (at the time a Menshevik) at a conference in Zimmerwald, attended by 35 Socialist leaders in September 1915. Inevitably Vladimir Lenin, supported by Zinoviev and Radek, strongly contested them. Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left. Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace. Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that \\"from the standpoint of the working class and of the labouring masses from the lesser evil would be the defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy\\"; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe.[6]\\r\\nAn elementary theory of property, believed by many peasants, was that land should belong to those who work on it. At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly. Change was facilitated by the physical movement of growing numbers of peasant villagers who migrated to and from industrial and urban environments, but also by the introduction of city culture into the village through material goods, the press, and word of mouth.[nb 1]\\r\\nWorkers also had good reasons for discontent: overcrowded housing with often deplorable sanitary conditions, long hours at work (on the eve of the war a 10-hour workday six days a week was the average and many were working 11ÿ12 hours a day by 1916), constant risk of injury and death from poor safety and sanitary conditions, harsh discipline (not only rules and fines, but foremen's fists), and inadequate wages (made worse after 1914 by steep wartime increases in the cost of living). At the same time, urban industrial life was full of benefits, though these could be just as dangerous, from the point of view of social and political stability, as the hardships. There were many encouragements to expect more from life. Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires. Living in cities, workers encountered material goods such as they had never seen in villages. Most important, living in cities, they were exposed to new ideas about the social and political order.[nb 2]\\r\\nThe social causes of the Russian Revolution mainly came from centuries of oppression of the lower classes by the Tsarist regime, and Nicholas's failures in World War I. While rural agrarian peasants had been emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked. The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte's land reforms of the early 20th century. Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked. Russia consisted mainly of poor farming peasants, with 1.5% of the population owning 25% of the land.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe rapid industrialization of Russia also resulted in urban overcrowding and poor conditions for urban industrial workers (as mentioned above). Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth. This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times. In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of sixteen people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room. There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers. The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I. Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated. By 1914, 40% of Russian workers were employed in factories of 1,000+ workers (32% in 1901). 42% worked in 100ÿ1,000 worker enterprises, 18% in 1ÿ100 worker businesses (in the US, 1914, the figures were 18, 47 and 35 respectively).[7]\\r\\nWorld War I added to the chaos. Conscription swept up the unwilling across Russia. The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers caused many more labor riots and strikes. Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants, and then, when famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food. Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar. This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, and were replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities, who had little loyalty to the Tsar.\\r\\nMany sections of the country had reason to be dissatisfied with the existing autocracy. Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system. Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the country. Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy. Perhaps more than any other modern monarch, Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people.[nb 3]\\r\\nThis idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state of his country. With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty. This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people. Even after the 1905 revolution spurred the Tsar to decree limited civil rights and democratic representation, he worked to limit even these liberties in order to preserve the ultimate authority of the crown.[nb 3]\\r\\nDespite constant oppression, the desire of the people for democratic participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russias liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I.\\r\\nDissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops. Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto, which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma). The Tsar undermined this promise of reform but a year later with Article 87 of the 1906 Fundamental State Laws, and subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative. Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.\\r\\nOne of the Tsars principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese war. Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy. The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War. Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhuman working conditions. Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led to the horrifying slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and society in general to the point of collapse.\\r\\nThe outbreak of war in August 1914 initially served to quiet the prevalent social and political protests, focusing hostilities against a common external enemy, but this patriotic unity did not last long. As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll. More important, though, was a deeper fragility: although many ordinary Russians joined anti-German demonstrations in the first few weeks of the war, the most widespread reaction appears to have been skepticism and fatalism. Hostility toward the Kaiser and the desire to defend their land and their lives did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for the Tsar or the government.[9][10][11]\\r\\nRussia's first major battle of the war was a disaster: in the 1914 Battle of Tannenberg, over 30,000 Russian troops were killed or wounded and 90,000 captured, while Germany suffered just 12,000 casualties. However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year. In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government. Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented. In the eyes of Michael Lynch, a revisionist historian (member of the School of Historical Studies at the University of Leicester) who focuses on the role of the people, Rasputin was a \\"fatal disease\\" to the Tsarist regime.\\r\\nIn 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to the Eastern front. The superior German army?ÿ better led, better trained and better supplied?ÿ was terrifyingly effective against the ill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland, during the GorliceÿTarn܇w Offensive campaign. By the end of October 1916, Russia had lost between 1,600,000 and 1,800,000 soldiers, with an additional 2,000,000 prisoners of war and 1,000,000 missing, all making up a total of nearly 5,000,000 men.\\r\\nThese staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts that began to occur. In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy started to circulate. Soldiers went hungry, and lacked shoes, munitions, and even weapons. Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a series of military defeats.\\r\\nCasualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, by the end of 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained recruits had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917.\\r\\nThe huge losses on the battlefields were not limited to men. The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and, by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms. It was hoped that they could equip themselves with the arms that they recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields. The soldiers did not feel that they were being treated as valuable soldiers, or even as human beings, but rather as raw materials to be squandered for the purposes of the rich and powerful.\\r\\nBy the spring of 1915, the army was in steady retreat, which was not always orderly; desertion, plunder and chaotic flight were not uncommon. By 1916, however, the situation had improved in many respects. Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life. Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production. Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915. The fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of the war, still draining away strength and lives from the country and its many individuals and families, remained an oppressive inevitability. The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) \\"was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved.\\"[12]\\r\\nThe war devastated not only soldiers. By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it difficult to buy even what one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually buy food.\\r\\nNot surprisingly, strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so did crime; but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end.\\r\\nGovernment officials responsible for public order worried about how long people's patience would last. A report by the St. Petersburg branch of the security police, the Okhrana, in October 1916, warned bluntly of \\"the possibility in the near future of riots by the lower classes of the empire enraged by the burdens of daily existence.\\"[13]\\r\\nNicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble. As discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916. It stated that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional form of government was put in place. Nicholas ignored these warnings and Russia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917. One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed.\\r\\nAt the beginning of February, Petrograd workers began several strikes and demonstrations.[citation needed] On 7 March [O.S. 22 February], workers at Putilov, Petrograd's largest industrial plant, announced a strike.[14]\\r\\nThe next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings. Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes. The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike.[15] By 10 March [O.S. 25 February], virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises. Students, white-collar workers and teachers joined the workers in the streets and at public meetings.[citation needed]\\r\\nTo quell the riots, the Tsar looked to the army. At least 180,000 troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured. Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included so many women. It was for this reason that when, on 11 March [O.S. 26 February], the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to mutiny.[16] Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed ÿ not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act. The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties establish the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers. The remaining loyal units switched allegiance the next day.[17]\\r\\nThe Tsar directed the royal train back towards Petrograd, which was stopped 14 March [O.S. 1 March],[16] by a group of revolutionaries at Malaya Vishera. When the Tsar finally arrived at in Pskov, the Army Chief Nikolai Ruzsky, and the Duma deputees Guchkov and Vasily Shulgin suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne. He did so on 15 March [O.S. 2 March], on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice, on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich.[16] Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to succeed him. But the Grand Duke realised that he would have little support as ruler, so he declined the crown on 16 March [O.S. 3 March],[16] stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action.[18] Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as \\"Nicholas Romanov\\", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo.[19] He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government.\\r\\nThe immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd.[20] On 16 March [O.S. 3 March], a provisional government was announced. The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic party (KD).[21] The socialists had formed their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) four days earlier. The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over Russia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe effective power of the Provisional Government was challenged by the authority of an institution that claimed to represent the will of workers and soldiers and could, in fact, mobilize and control these groups during the early months of the revolution?ÿ the Petrograd Soviet [Council] of Workers' Deputies. The model for the soviet were workers' councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 Revolution. In February 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties. On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council. The Petrograd Soviet met in the Tauride Palace, the same building where the new government was taking shape.\\r\\nThe leaders of the Petrograd Soviet believed that they represented particular classes of the population, not the whole nation. They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism. So they saw their role as limited to pressuring hesitant \\"bourgeoisie\\" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on).[22] They met in the same building as the emerging Provisional Government not to compete with the Duma Committee for state power but to best exert pressure on the new government, to act, in other words, as a popular democratic lobby.\\r\\nThe relationship between these two major powers was complex from the beginning and would shape the politics of 1917. The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to \\"take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\", though they were also determined to prevent \\"interference in the actions of the government\\", which would create \\"an unacceptable situation of dual power.\\"[23] In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this \\"dual power\\" (dvoevlastie) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russias cities, in factories and shops, in barracks and in the trenches, and in the villages.\\r\\nA series of political crises?ÿ see the chronology below?ÿ in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership, The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK)) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviet. Although the Soviet leadership initially refused to participate in the \\"bourgeois\\" Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, a young and popular lawyer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP), agreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in the government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government. As minister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech, released thousands of political prisoners, did his very best to continue the war effort and even organised another offensive (which, however, was no more successful than its predecessors). Nevertheless, Kerensky still faced several great challenges, highlighted by the soldiers, urban workers and peasants, who claimed that they had gained nothing by the revolution:\\r\\nThe political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution. Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult. Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even?ÿ if the Bolsheviks came to power?ÿ led to Russia's withdrawal from the war. Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany. After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917.\\r\\nOn the way to Russia, Lenin prepared the April Theses, which outlined central Bolshevik policies. These included that the soviets take power (as seen in the slogan \\"all power to the soviets\\") and denouncing the liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, forbidding co-operation with it. Many Bolsheviks, however, had supported the Provisional Government, including Lev Kamenev. [24]\\r\\nWith Lenin's arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily. Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties. Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for \\"all power to the Soviets,\\" the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet. In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviet itself, which was viewed as subservient to the conservative government. By some historians' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917.\\r\\nOn 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably. Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise. The soldiers refused to follow the new orders. The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors?ÿ who had tried and executed many officers, including one admiral?ÿ further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere. The sailors and soldiers, along with Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for \\"all power to the Soviets.\\" The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin[25] and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days. In the aftermath, Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky, among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested. The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups: soldiers and workers.\\r\\nThe Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary. The Bolsheviks had undergone a spectacular growth in membership. Whereas, in February 1917, the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction.[26] Previously, the Bolsheviks had been in the minority in the two leading cities of RussiaSt. Petersburg and Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September the Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities.[27] Furthermore, the Bolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the Party organizations of the thirteen (13) provinces around Moscow. These thirteen provinces held 37% of Russia's population and 20% of the membership of the Bolshevik faction.[27]\\r\\nIn August, poor or misleading communication led General Lavr Kornilov, the recently appointed Supreme Commander of Russian military forces, to believe that the Petrograd government had already been captured by radicals, or was in serious danger thereof.[dubious ÿ discuss] In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city. To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance. He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to \\"defend the revolution\\". The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops. With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position. The Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position.\\r\\nIn early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less and less as a force in support of their needs and interests. The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes.\\r\\nIn Finland, Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution[28] and continued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees. By October, he returned to Petrograd (St. Petersburg), aware that the increasingly radical city presented him no legal danger and a second opportunity for revolution. Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks. Lenin was of the opinion that taking power should occur in both St. Petersburg and Moscow simultaneously, parenthetically stating that it made no difference which city rose up first, but expressing his opinion that Moscow may well rise up first.[29] The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet. The resolution was passed 10ÿ2 (Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) and the October Revolution began.\\r\\nThe October Revolution was led by Vladimir Lenin and was based upon Lenin's writing on the ideas of Karl Marx, a political ideology often known as MarxismÿLeninism. It marked the beginning of the spread of communism in the 20th century. It was far less sporadic than the revolution of February and came about as the result of deliberate planning and coordinated activity to that end.\\r\\nThough Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party, it has been argued that since Lenin was not present during the actual takeover of the Winter Palace, it was really Trotsky's organization and direction that led the revolution, merely spurred by the motivation Lenin instigated within his party.[30] Critics on the Right have long argued that the financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent, Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided, since there is little evidence supporting that claim.\\r\\nOn 7 November 1917, Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin led his leftist revolutionaries in a revolt against the ineffective Provisional Government (Russia was still using the Julian calendar at the time, so period references show a 25 October date). The October revolution ended the phase of the revolution instigated in February, replacing Russia's short-lived provisional parliamentary government with government by soviets, local councils elected by bodies of workers and peasants. Liberal and monarchist forces, loosely organized into the White Army, immediately went to war against the Bolsheviks' Red Army, in a series of battles that would become known as the Russian Civil War.\\r\\nSoviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the soviets themselves. The elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly took place in November 1917. The Bolsheviks gained 24% of the vote.[31] When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the soviets.[citation needed] The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.[31] Not surprisingly, this caused mass domestic tension with many individuals who called for another series of political reform, revolting, and calling for \\"a third Russian revolution,\\" a movement that received a significant amount of support. The most notable instances of this anti-Bolshevik mentality were expressed in the Tambov rebellion, 1919ÿ1921, and the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. These movements, which made a wide range of demands and lacked effective coordination, were eventually defeated along with the White Army during the Civil War.\\r\\nThe Russian Civil War, which broke out in 1918 shortly after the October Revolution, brought death and suffering to millions of people regardless of their political orientation. The war was fought mainly between the Red Army (\\"Reds\\"), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik minority, and the \\"Whites\\"?ÿ army officers and cossacks, the \\"bourgeoisie\\", and political groups ranging from the far Right to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government to the soviets (under clear Bolshevik dominance).[32][33] The Whites had backing from nations such as Great Britain, France, USA and Japan, while the Reds possessed internal support which proved to be much more effective. Though the Allied nations, using external interference, provided substantial military aid to the loosely knit anti-Bolshevik forces, they were ultimately defeated.[32]\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks firstly assumed power in Petrograd, expanding their rule outwards. They eventually reached the Easterly Siberian Russian coast in Vladivostok, 4 years after the war began, an occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military campaigns in the nation. Less than one year later the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District, directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923.\\r\\nSeveral revolts were initiated against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion. This was a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt. This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing Bolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures of grain crops by the Communists.[34] This all amounted to large-scale discontent. When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the Russian right to freedom.[35] The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army. The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts and suffered 10 thousand casualties before entering the city of Kronstadt.[36] This ended the rebellions fairly quickly, causing many of the rebels to flee to political exile.[37]\\r\\nDuring the Civil War, Nestor Makhno led a Ukrainian anarchist movement, the Black Army allied to the Bolsheviks thrice, one of the powers ending the alliance each time. However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge into the Red Army. In addition, the so-called \\"Green Army\\" (peasants defending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war, mainly in the Ukraine.\\r\\nThe Bolsheviks executed the tsar and his family on 16 July 1918.[38] In early March, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, 24 kilometres (15?mi) south of Petrograd. In August 1917 the Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals, to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. After the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased. As the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to Yekaterinburg, a militant Bolshevik stronghold.\\r\\nDuring the early morning of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and shot. According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly from Lenin and Sverdlov in Moscow. That the order came from the top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence. The execution may have been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or it may have been an option pre-approved in Moscow should White troops approach Yekaterinburg. Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the evidence.[39][40]\\r\\nLeon Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without the success of the world revolution. Indeed, a revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923. Despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918ÿ19, in the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic and others like it, no other Marxist movement at the time succeeded in keeping power in its hands.\\r\\nThis issue is subject to conflicting views on the communist history by various Marxist groups and parties. Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea, stating that socialism was possible in one country.\\r\\nThe confusion regarding Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact that he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument?ÿ the argument that socialism's success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen?ÿ to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.\\r\\nFew events in historical research have been as conditioned by political influences as the October Revolution. The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view.[41] Since the fall of Communism in Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and the Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished.[42]\\r\\nLenin's biographer Robert Service, says he, \\"laid the foundations of dictatorship and lawlessness. Lenin had consolidated the principle of state penetration of the whole society, its economy and its culture. Lenin had practised terror and advocated revolutionary amoralism.\\"[43]\\r\\nDates are correct for the Julian calendar, which was used in Russia until 1918. It was twelve days behind the Gregorian calendar during the 19th century and thirteen days behind it during the 20th century.\\r\\nGeorge Orwell's classic novella Animal Farm is an allegory of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath. It describes the dictator Stalin as a big Berkshire boar named, \\"Napoleon.\\" Trotsky is represented by a pig called Snowball who is a brilliant talker and makes magnificent speeches. However, Napoleon overthrows Snowball as Stalin overthrew Trotsky and Napoleon takes over the farm the animals live on.

As of 2017, she is the only woman ever to receive the Medal of Honor.[1]\\r\\nIn 1855, she earned her medical degree at Syracuse Medical College in New York,[2] married and started a medical practice. She volunteered with the Union Army at the outbreak of the American Civil War and served as a surgeon at a temporary hospital in Washington, DC, even though at the time women and sectarian physicians were considered unfit for the Union Army Examining Board.[3] She was captured by Confederate forces[2] after crossing enemy lines to treat wounded civilians and arrested as a spy. She was sent as a prisoner of war to Richmond, Virginia, until released in a prisoner exchange.\\r\\nAfter the war, she was approved for the highest United States Armed Forces decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor, for her efforts during the Civil War. She is the only woman to receive the medal and one of only eight civilians to receive it. Her name was deleted from the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 (along with over 900 others); however it was restored in 1977.[2] After the war, she was a writer and lecturer supporting the women's suffrage movement until her death in 1919.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMary Edwards Walker was born in the Town of Oswego, New York, on November 26, 1832, the daughter of Alvah (father) and Vesta (mother) Walker. She was the youngest of seven children: she had five sisters and one brother. Alvah and Vesta raised both their son and their daughters in a progressive manner that was revolutionary for the time. Their nontraditional parenting nurtured Mary's spirit of independence and sense of justice that she actively demonstrated throughout her life. While they were devoted Christians, the Walkers were \\"free thinkers\\" who raised their children to question the regulations and restrictions of various denominations.[4] The Walker parents also demonstrated non-traditional gender roles to their children regarding sharing work around the farm: Vesta often participated in heavy labor while Alvah took part in general household chores.[4] Walker worked on her family farm as a child. She did not wear women's clothing during farm labor, because she considered it too restricting. Her mother reinforced her views that corsets and tight lacings were unhealthy.[5]\\r\\nHer elementary education consisted of attendance at the local school that her parents had started. The Walkers were determined that their daughters be as well-educated as their son, so they founded the first free school house in Oswego in the late 1830s.[4] After finishing primary school, Mary and two of her older sisters attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York.[4] Falley was not only an institution of higher learning, but a place that emphasized modern social reform in gender roles, education, and hygiene.[4] Its ideologies and practices further cemented Mary's determination to defy traditional feminine standards on a principle of injustice. In her free time, Mary would pore over her father's medical texts on anatomy and physiology; her interest in medicine is attributable to her exposure to medical literature at an early age.[4] As a young woman, she taught at a school in Minetto, New York, eventually earning enough money to pay her way through Syracuse Medical College (now the State University of New York Upstate Medical University), where she graduated with honors as a medical doctor in 1855, the only woman in her class.[4]\\r\\nShe married a fellow medical school student, Albert Miller, on November 16, 1855, shortly before she turned 23.[4] Walker wore a short skirt with trousers underneath, refused to include \\"obey\\" in her vows, and retained her last name, all characteristic of her obstinate nonconformity.[4] They set up a joint practice in Rome, New York.[6] The practice did not flourish, as female physicians were generally not trusted or respected at that time.[7] They later divorced, on account of Miller's infidelity.[8]\\r\\nWalker briefly attended Bowen Collegiate Institute (later named Lenox College) in Hopkinton, Iowa, in 1860, until she was suspended for refusing to resign from the school's debating society, which until she joined had been all male.\\r\\nInspired by her parents' novel standard of dressing for health purposes, Walker was infamous for contesting traditional female wardrobe. In 1871, she wrote, \\"The greatest sorrows from which women suffer to-day are those physical, moral, and mental ones, that are caused by their unhygienic manner of dressing!\\"[8] She strongly opposed women's long skirts with numerous petticoats, not only for their discomfort and their inhibition to the wearer's mobility, but for their collection and spread of dust and dirt. As a young woman, she began experimenting with various skirt-lengths and layers, all with men's trousers underneath. By 1861, her typical ensemble included trousers with suspenders under a knee-length dress with a tight waist and full skirt.[8]\\r\\nWhile encouraged by her family, Walker's wardrobe choices were often met with criticism. Once, a schoolteacher, she was assaulted on her way home by a neighboring farmer and a group of boys, who chased her and attacked her with eggs and other missiles.[4] Female colleagues in medical school criticized her choices, and patients often gawked at her and teased her. She nevertheless persisted in her mission to reform women's dress. Her view that women's dress should \\"protect the person, and allow freedom of motion and circulation, and not make the wearer a slave to it\\" made her commitment to dress reform as great as her zeal for abolitionism.[9] She famously wrote to the women's journal, The Sibyl: A Review of the Tastes, Errors, and Fashions of Society, about her campaign against women's fashion, amongst other things, for its injuries to health, its expense, and its contribution to the dissolution of marriages.[4] Her literature contributed to the spread of her ideas, and made her a popular figure amongst other feminists and female physicians.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War, she volunteered for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first she was allowed to practice only as a nurse.[2] During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga.[10] As a suffragist, she was happy to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man.[11] Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army.[10] She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.[10]\\r\\nIn September 1862, Walker wrote to the War Department requesting employment as a spy, but her proposal was declined.[12] In September 1863, she was employed as a \\"Contract Acting Assistant Surgeon (civilian)\\" by the Army of the Cumberland, becoming the first female surgeon employed by the U.S. Army Surgeon.[13] Walker was later appointed assistant surgeon of the 52nd Ohio Infantry. During her service, she frequently crossed battle lines and treated civilians.\\r\\nOn April 10, 1864, she was captured by Confederate troops, and arrested as a spy, just after she finished helping a Confederate doctor perform an amputation. She was sent to Castle Thunder in Richmond, Virginia, and remained there until August 12, 1864, when she was released as part of a prisoner exchange.[14] While she was imprisoned, she refused to wear the clothes provided her, said to be more \\"becoming of her sex\\". Walker was exchanged for a Confederate surgeon from Tennessee on August 12, 1864.[3]\\r\\nShe went on to serve as supervisor of a female prison in Louisville, Kentucky, and as the head of an orphanage in Tennessee.[13]\\r\\nAfter the war, Walker was awarded a disability pension for partial muscular atrophy suffered while she was imprisoned by the enemy. She was given $8.50 a month, beginning June 13, 1865, but in 1899 that amount was raised to $20 per month.[15]\\r\\nShe became a writer and lecturer, supporting such issues as health care, temperance, women's rights, and dress reform for women. She was frequently arrested for wearing men's clothing, and insisted on her right to wear clothing that she thought appropriate.[16] She wrote two books that discussed women's rights and dress. She replied to criticism of her attire: \\"I don't wear men's clothes, I wear my own clothes.\\"[17]\\r\\nWalker was a member of the central woman's suffrage Bureau in Washington, and solicited funds to endow a chair for a woman professor at Howard University medical school.[3] She attempted to register to vote in 1871, but was turned away. The initial stance of the movement, following Walker's lead, was to claim that women already had the right to vote, and Congress needed only to enact enabling legislation. After a number of fruitless years advocating this position, the movement promoted the adoption of a constitutional amendment. This was diametrically opposed to Walker's position, and she fell out of favor with the movement. She continued to attend suffrage conventions and distribute her own literature, but was virtually ignored by the rest of the movement. Her penchant for wearing masculine clothing, including a top hat, only exacerbated the situation.[clarification needed][13] She received a more favorable reception in England than in the United States.[18]\\r\\nIn 1907, Walker published \\"Crowning Constitutional Argument\\", in which she argued that some States, as well as the federal Constitution, had already granted women the right to vote. She testified on women's suffrage before committees of the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 and 1914.\\r\\nAfter a long illness, Walker died at home on February 21, 1919, at the age of eighty-six.[19] She was buried at Rural Cemetery in Oswego, New York, in a plain funeral, with an American flag draped over her casket, and wearing a black suit instead of a dress.[20] Her death in 1919 came one year before the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed women the right to vote.[13]\\r\\nAfter the war, Walker was recommended for the Medal of Honor by Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and George Henry Thomas. On November 11, 1865, President Andrew Johnson signed a bill to award her the medal.\\r\\nIn 1917, the U.S. Congress created a pension act for Medal of Honor recipients, and in doing so created separate Army and Navy Medal of Honor Rolls. Only the Army decided to review eligibility for inclusion on the Army Medal of Honor Roll. The 1917 Medal of Honor Board deleted 911 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll, including those of Dr. Mary Edwards Walker and William F. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" Cody. The disenrolled recipients were ordered to return their medals, but Walker continued to wear hers until her death.[21]\\r\\nPresident Jimmy Carter restored her medal posthumously in 1977.[22][23] She is one of six people to regain the award.[3][24]\\r\\nWalker felt that she had been awarded the Medal of Honor because she had gone into enemy territory to care for the suffering inhabitants, when no man had the courage to do so, for fear of being imprisoned.[3]\\r\\nRank and organization: Contract Acting Assistant Surgeon (civilian), U.

For Sharp (1921), \\"According to the older usage the extra-nuclear portion of the protoplast [the entire cell, excluding the cell wall] was called \\"protoplasm,\\" but the nucleus also is composed of protoplasm, or living substance in its broader sense. The current consensus is to avoid this ambiguity by employing Strasburger's [(1882)] terms cytoplasm [coined by K?lliker (1863), originally as synonym for protoplasm] and nucleoplasm ([term coined by van Beneden (1875), or] karyoplasm, [used by] Flemming [(1878)])\\".[2][3][4][5][6] The cytoplasm definition of Strasburger excluded the plastids (Chromatoplasm).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the nucleus, the inclusion or not of the vacuole in the protoplasm concept is also controversial.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides \\"protoplasm\\", many other related terms and distinctions were used for the cell contents over time:[8][9]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe word \\"protoplasm\\" comes from the Greek protos for first, and plasma for thing formed, and was originally used in religious contexts.[39] It was used in 1839 by J. E. Purkinje for the material of the animal embryo.[12][40] Later, in 1846 Hugo von Mohl redefined the term (also named as Primordialschlauch, \\"primordial utricle\\") to refer to the \\"tough, slimy, granular, semi-fluid\\" substance within plant cells, to distinguish this from the cell wall and the cell sap (Zellsaft) within the vacuole.[13][41][42] Thomas Huxley (1869) later referred to it as the \\"physical basis of life\\" and considered that the property of life resulted from the distribution of molecules within this substance.[43] The protoplasm became an \\"epistemic thing\\".[44] Its composition, however, was mysterious and there was much controversy over what sort of substance it was.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1872, Beale created the vitalist term \\"bioplasm\\", to contrast with the materialism of Huxley.[22][46] In 1880, term protoplast was proposed by Hanstein (1880) for the entire cell, excluding the cell wall,[47][48] and some authors like Julius von Sachs (1882) preferred that name instead of cell.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1965, lardy introduced the term \\"cytosol\\", later redefined to refer to the liquid inside cell.[38]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the time Huxley wrote, a long-standing debate was largely settled over the fundamental unit of life: was it the cell or was it protoplasm? By the late 1860s, the debate was largely settled in favor of protoplasm. The cell was a container for protoplasm, the fundamental and universal material substance of life. Huxley's principal contribution was to establish protoplasm as incompatible with a vitalistic theory of life.[50] Attempts to investigate the origin of life through the creation of synthetic \\"protoplasm\\" in the laboratory were not successful.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea that protoplasm of eukaryotes is simply divisible into a ground substance called \\"cytoplasm\\" and a structural body called the cell nucleus reflects the more primitive knowledge of cell structure that preceded the development of electron microscopy, when it seemed that cytoplasm was a homogeneous fluid and the existence of most sub-cellular compartments, or how cells maintain their shape, was unknown.[52] Today, it is known that the cell contents are structurally very complex and contain multiple organelles.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtoplasm is composed of a mixture of small molecules such as ions, amino acids, monosaccharides and water, and macromolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides.[53] In eukaryotes the protoplasm surrounding the cell nucleus is known as the cytoplasm and that inside the nucleus as the nucleoplasm. In prokaryotes the material inside the plasma membrane is the bacterial cytoplasm, while in Gram-negative bacteria the region outside the plasma membrane but inside the outer membrane is the periplasm.\\r\\n\\r\\nProtoplasm was said to exist in two forms: a liquid-like sol state or a jelly-like gel state.","input":"What is the fluid substance of cell known as?"},{"output":"March 4, 1913","context":"The United States Department of Labor (DOL) is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government responsible for occupational safety, wage and hour standards, unemployment insurance benefits, reemployment services, and some economic statistics; many U.S. states also have such departments.

Homunculus is Latin for \\"little man\\", and was a term used in alchemy and folklore prior to the concept being utilized in scientific literature. A cortical homunculus, or \\"cortex man\\", illustrates the concept of a representation of the body lying within the brain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA motor homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to motor processing for different anatomical divisions of the body. The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus, and handles signals coming from the premotor area of the frontal lobes.[1]\\r\\nA sensory homunculus represents a map of brain areas dedicated to sensory processing for different anatomical divisions of the body. The primary sensory cortex is located in the postcentral gyrus, and handles signals coming from the thalamus.[1]\\r\\nThese signals are transmitted on from the gyri to the brain stem and spinal cord via corresponding nerves.\\r\\nAlong the length of the primary motor and sensory cortices, the areas specializing in different parts of the body are arranged in an orderly manner, although ordered differently than one might expect. The toes are represented at the top of the cerebral hemisphere (or more accurately, \\"the upper end\\", since the cortex curls inwards and down at the top), and then as one moves down the hemisphere, progressively higher parts of the body are represented, assuming a body that's faceless and has arms raised. Going further down the cortex, the different areas of the face are represented, in approximately top-to-bottom order, rather than bottom-to-top as before. The homunculus is split in half, with motor and sensory representations for the left side of the body on the right side of the brain, and vice-versa.[2]\\r\\nThe amount of cortex devoted to any given body region is not proportional to that body region's surface area or volume, but rather to how richly innervated that region is. Areas of the body with more complex and/or more numerous sensory or motor connections are represented as larger in the homunculus, while those with less complex and/or less numerous connections are represented as smaller. The resulting image is that of a distorted human body, with disproportionately huge hands, lips, and face.\\r\\nIn the sensory homunculus, below the areas handling sensation for the teeth, gums, jaw, tongue, and pharynx lies an area for intra-abdominal sensation. At the very top end of the primary sensory cortex, beyond the area for the toes, it has traditionally been believed that the sensory neural networks for the genitals occur. However, more recent research has suggested that there may be two different cortical areas for the genitals, possibly differentiated by one dealing with erogenous stimulation and the other dealing with non-erogenous stimulation.[3][4][5]\\r\\nDr. Wilder Penfield and his co-investigators Edwin Boldrey and Theodore Rasmussen are considered to be the originators of the sensory and motor homunculi. They were not the first scientists to attempt to objectify human brain function by means of a homunculus.[5] However, they were the first to differentiate between sensory and motor function and to map the two across the brain separately, resulting in two different homunculi. In addition, their drawings and later drawings derived from theirs became perhaps the most famous conceptual maps in modern neuroscience because they compellingly illustrated the data at a single glance.[5]\\r\\nPenfield first conceived of his homunculi as a thought experiment, and went so far as to envision an imaginary world in which the homunculi lived, which he referred to as \\"if\\". He and his colleagues went on to experiment with electrical stimulation of different brain areas of patients undergoing open brain surgery to control epilepsy, and were thus able to produce the topographical brain maps and their corresponding homunculi.[5][6]\\r\\nMore recent studies have improved this understanding of somatotopic arrangement using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).[7]\\r\\nPenfield referred to his creations as \\"grotesque creatures\\" due to their strange-looking proportions. For example, the sensory nerves arriving from the hands terminate over large areas of the brain, resulting in the hands of the homunculus being correspondingly large. In contrast, the nerves emanating from the torso or arms cover a much smaller area, thus the torso and arms of the homunculus look comparatively small and weak.\\r\\nPenfield's homunculi are usually shown as 2-D diagrams. This is an oversimplification, as it cannot fully show the data set Penfield collected from his brain surgery patients. Rather than the sharp delineation between different body areas shown in the drawings, there is actually significant overlap between neighboring regions. The simplification suggests that lesions of the motor cortex will give rise to specific deficits in specific muscles. However, this is a misconception, as lesions produce deficits in groups of synergistic muscles. This finding suggests that the motor cortex functions in terms of overall movements as coordinated groups of individual motions.\\r\\nThe sensorimotor homunculi can also be represented as 3-D figures (such as the sensory homunculus sculpted by Sharon Price-James shown from different angles below), which can make it easier for laymen to understand the ratios between the different body regions' levels of motor or sensory innervation. However, these 3-D models do not illustrate which areas of the brain are associated with which parts of the body.","input":"Who is credited with creating the motor and somatosensory homunculi?"},{"output":"1 January 2007","context":"The 2007 enlargement of the European Union saw Bulgaria and Romania join the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007. Together with the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, it is considered part of the fifth wave of enlargement of the European Union.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRomania was the first country of post-communist Europe to have official relations with the European Community. In 1974, a treaty included Romania in the Community's Generalized System of Preferences. Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, membership of the EC, and its successor the European Union (EU), has been the main goal of every Romanian Government and practically every political party in Romania. Romania signed its Europe Agreement in 1993,[2] and submitted its official application for membership in the EU on 22 June 1995 and Bulgaria submitted its official application for membership in the EU on 14 December 1995, the third and the fourth of the postÿcommunist European countries to do so after Hungary and Poland. Along with its official EU application, Romania submitted the Snagov Declaration, signed by all fourteen major political parties declaring their full support for EU membership.[3]\\r\\nDuring the 2000s, Bulgaria and Romania implemented a number of reforms to prepare for EU accession, including the consolidation of its democratic systems, the institution of the rule of law, the acknowledgement of respect for human rights, the commitment to personal freedom of expression, and the implementation of a functioning free-market economy. The objective of joining the EU has also influenced Romania's regional relations. As a result, Bulgaria and Romania have imposed visa regimes on a number of states, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Serbia, Montenegro, Turkey and Moldova.\\r\\nWithin the framework of integration meetings held between the EU member states and the EU candidate states Bulgaria and Romania, an 'Association Committee' was held on 22 June 2004. It confirmed overall good progress for the preparation of accession; however, it highlighted the need for further reform of judicial structures in both Bulgaria and Romania, particularly in its pre-trial phases, as well as the need for further efforts to fight against political corruption and organized crime, including human trafficking. The findings were reflected in the 2004 Regular Report for Bulgaria and Romania.[4]\\r\\nThe Brussels European Council of December 17, 2004 confirmed the conclusion of accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania.[5] The 26 September 2006 of the European Commission[6] confirmed the date once more, also announcing that Bulgaria and Romania would meet no direct restrictions, but progress in certain areas  reforms of the judicial system, elimination of corruption and the struggle against organized crime  would be strictly monitored.\\r\\nWith this accession, Cyrillic became the third official alphabet of the EU, after the Latin and Greek alphabets.[7] Cyrillic will also be featured on the euro banknotes and the national (obverse) side of the Bulgarian euro coins.

It is still a demarcation line among four U.S. states, forming part of the borders of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia (originally part of Virginia before 1863). Later it became known as the border between the North and South. It also became the slavery border before the Missouri Compromise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMaryland's charter of 1632 granted the Calverts land north of the entire length of the Potomac River up to the 40th parallel. A problem arose when Charles II granted a charter for Pennsylvania in 1681. The grant defined Pennsylvania's southern border as identical to Maryland's northern border, but described it differently, as Charles relied on an inaccurate map. The terms of the grant clearly indicate that Charles II and William Penn believed the 40th parallel would intersect the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle, Delaware, when in fact it falls north of the original boundaries of the City of Philadelphia, the site of which Penn had already selected for his colony's capital city. Negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681. A compromise proposed by Charles II in 1682, which might have resolved the issue, was undermined by Penn receiving the additional grant of the \\"Three Lower Counties\\" along Delaware Bay, which later became the Delaware Colony, a satellite of Pennsylvania. Maryland considered these lands part of its original grant.[1]\\r\\nThe conflict became more of an issue when settlement extended into the interior of the colonies. In 1732 the proprietary governor of Maryland, Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, signed a provisional agreement with William Penn's sons, which drew a line somewhere in between and renounced the Calvert claim to Delaware. But later, Lord Baltimore claimed that the document he had signed did not contain the terms he had agreed to, and refused to put the agreement into effect. Beginning in the mid-1730s, violence erupted between settlers claiming various loyalties to Maryland and Pennsylvania. The border conflict would be known as Cresap's War.\\r\\nProgress was made after a Court of Chancery ruling affirming the 1732 agreement, but the issue remained unresolved until Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore ceased contesting the claims on the Maryland side and accepted the earlier agreements. Maryland's border with Delaware was to be based on the Transpeninsular Line and the Twelve-Mile Circle around New Castle. The PennsylvaniaÿMaryland border was defined as the line of latitude 15 miles (24?km) south of the southernmost house in Philadelphia (on what is today South Street). As part of the settlement, the Penns and Calverts commissioned the English team of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey the newly established boundaries between the Province of Pennsylvania, the Province of Maryland, and Delaware Colony.[1]\\r\\nIn 1779, Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed \\"To extend Mason's and Dixon's line, due west, five degrees of longitude, to be computed from the river Delaware, for the southern boundary of Pennsylvania, and that a meridian, drawn from the western extremity thereof to the northern limit of the said state, be the western boundary of Pennsylvania for ever.\\"[2]\\r\\nAfter Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1781, the western part of this line and the Ohio River became a border between slave and free states, with Delaware[3] retaining slavery until the Thirteenth Amendment was ratified in 1865.\\r\\nMason's and Dixon's actual survey line began to the south of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and extended from a benchmark east to the Delaware River and west to what was then the boundary with western Virginia.\\r\\nThe surveyors also fixed the boundary between Delaware and Pennsylvania and the approximately north-south portion of the boundary between Delaware and Maryland. Most of the DelawareÿPennsylvania boundary is an arc, and the DelawareÿMaryland boundary does not run truly north-south because it was intended to bisect the Delmarva Peninsula rather than follow a meridian.[4]\\r\\nThe MarylandÿPennsylvania boundary is an eastÿwest line with an approximate mean latitude of 394320 N (Datum WGS 84). In reality, the eastÿwest MasonÿDixon line is not a true line in the geometric sense, but is instead a series of many adjoining line segments, following a path between latitude 394315 N and 394323 N.\\r\\nThe surveyors also extended the boundary line 40 miles (64?km) west of Maryland's western boundary, into territory that was still in dispute between Pennsylvania and Virginia, though this was contrary to their original charter.[1] Mason and Dixon's survey was finished on October 9, 1767, about 31 miles (50?km) east of what is now Pennsylvania's southwest corner.[5]\\r\\nIn 1774, commissioners from Pennsylvania and Virginia met to negotiate their boundary, which at the time involved Pennsylvania's southern border west of Maryland and its entire western border. Both sides agreed that Pennsylvania's grant made its western border a tracing of the course of the Delaware River, displaced five degrees to the west. And both sides thought this would place Fort Pitt in Virginia territory (in fact it would not have). With that in mind, the governor of Pennsylvania argued that, despite the agreement reached with Maryland, Pennsylvania's southern border west of Maryland was still the 39th parallel, about 50 miles (80?km) south of the MasonÿDixon line. Negotiations continued for five years, with a series of proposed lines. In the end, a compromise was reached: the MasonÿDixon line would be extended west to a point five degrees west of the Delaware River. To compensate Pennsylvania for the claimed territory lost, its western boundary would be run due north rather than copying the course of the Delaware River.[1]\\r\\nThe MasonÿDixon line was marked by stones every mile and \\"crownstones\\" every 5 miles (8.0?km), using stone shipped from England. The Maryland side says \\"(M)\\" and the Delaware and Pennsylvania sides say \\"(P)\\". Crownstones include the two coats of arms. Today, while a number of the original stones are missing or buried, many are still visible, resting on public land and protected by iron cages.[6]\\r\\nMason and Dixon confirmed earlier survey work, which delineated Delaware's southern boundary from the Atlantic Ocean to the \\"Middle Point\\" stone (along what is today known as the Transpeninsular Line). They proceeded nearly due north from this, to the Pennsylvania border.\\r\\nLater, the line was marked in places by additional benchmarks and survey markers. The lines have been resurveyed several times over the centuries without substantive changes to Mason's and Dixon's work. The stones may be a few, to a few hundred, feet east or west of the point Mason and Dixon thought they were: in any event, the line drawn from stone to stone forms the legal boundary.\\r\\nAccording to Dave Doyle at the National Geodetic Survey, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the common corner of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware, at The Wedge is marked by Boundary Monument #87. The marker \\"MDP Corner\\" dates from 1935 and is offset on purpose.\\r\\nDoyle said the MarylandÿPennsylvania MasonÿDixon line is exactly:\\r\\nand Boundary Monument #87 is on that parallel, at:\\r\\nVisitors to the tripoint are strongly encouraged to first obtain permission from the nearest landowner, or use the path from the arc corner monument, which is bordered by Delaware parkland most of the way, and Pennsylvania parkland the entire way.\\r\\nThe line was established to end a boundary dispute between the British colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania/Delaware. Maryland had been granted the territory north of the Potomac River up to the fortieth parallel. Pennsylvania's grant defined the colony's southern boundary as following a 12-mile (radius) circle (19?km) counter-clockwise from the Delaware River until it hit \\"the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern latitude.\\" From there the boundary was to follow the fortieth parallel due west for five degrees of longitude. But the fortieth parallel does not in fact intersect the 12-mile circle, instead lying significantly farther north. Thus Pennsylvania's southern boundary as defined in its charter was contradictory and unclear. The most serious problem was that the Maryland claim would put Philadelphia, the major city in Pennsylvania, within Maryland.[1]\\r\\nThe dispute was peacefully resolved in 1767[7] when the boundary was fixed as follows:\\r\\nThe disputants engaged an expert British team, astronomer Charles Mason and surveyor Jeremiah Dixon, to survey what became known as the MasonÿDixon line.[8][9] It cost the Calverts of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania S3,512 9/- (9 shillings 0 pence) to have 244 miles (393?km) surveyed with such accuracy. To them the money was well spent, for in a new country there was no other way of establishing ownership.[10][11]\\r\\nThe MasonÿDixon line is made up of four segments corresponding to the terms of the settlement:\\r\\nThe most difficult task was fixing the tangent line, as they had to confirm the accuracy of the transpeninsular line midpoint and the 12-mile circle, determine the tangent point along the circle, and then actually survey and monument the border. They then surveyed the north and arc lines. They did this work between 1763 and 1767. This actually left a small wedge of land in dispute between Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921.[12][better?source?needed]\\r\\nIn April 1765, Mason and Dixon began their survey of the more famous MarylandÿPennsylvania line. They were commissioned to run it for a distance of five degrees of longitude west from the Delaware River, fixing the western boundary of Pennsylvania (see the entry for Yohogania County). However, in October 1767, at Dunkard Creek near Mount Morris, Pennsylvania, nearly 244 miles (393?km) west of the Delaware, their Iroquois guides refused to go any further, having reached the border of their lands with the Lenape, with whom they were engaged in hostilities. As such the group was forced to quit, and on October 11, they made their final observations, 233 miles (375?km) from their starting point.[13]\\r\\nIn 1784, surveyors David Rittenhouse and Andrew Ellicott and their crew completed the survey of the MasonÿDixon line to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, five degrees from the Delaware River.[14] Other surveyors continued west to the Ohio River. The section of the line between the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania and the river is the county line between Marshall and Wetzel counties, West Virginia.[15]\\r\\nThe MasonÿDixon line has been resurveyed three times: in 1849, 1900, and in the 1960s.[8] On November 14, 1963, during the bicentennial of the MasonÿDixon line, U.S. President John F. Kennedy opened a newly completed section of Interstate 95 where it crossed the MarylandÿDelaware border. It was one of his last public appearances before his assassination in Dallas, Texas. The Delaware Turnpike and the Maryland portion of the new road were later designated as the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway.\\r\\nMason and Dixon could only do the work as accurately as they did due to the work of Nevil Maskelyne, some of whose instruments they used.[16] There was keen interest in their work and much communication between the surveyors, Maskelyne and other members of the British Scientific establishment in the Royal Society in Britain, notably Henry Cavendish.[17][18][19] During such survey work, it is normal to survey from point to point along the line and then survey back to the starting point, where if there were no errors the origin and re-surveyed position would coincide.[20] Normally the return errors would be random ÿ i.e. the return survey errors compared to the intermediate points back to the start point would be spatially randomly distributed around the start point.[21] Mason and Dixon found that there were larger than expected systematic errors, i.e. non-random errors, that led the return survey consistently being in one direction away from the starting point.[22] When this information got back to the Royal Society members, Henry Cavendish realised that this may have been due to the gravitational pull of the Allegheny Mountains deflecting the theodolite plumb-bobs and spirit levels.[17][23][24] Maskelyne then proposed measuring the gravitational force causing this deflection induced by the pull of a nearby mountain upon a plumb-bob in 1772 and sent Mason (who had returned to England) on a site survey through central England and Scotland to find a suitable location during the summer of 1773.[25][26][27] Mason selected Schiehallion at which to conduct what became known as the Schiehallion experiment, which was carried out primarily by Maskelyne and determined the density of the Scottish mountain.[16][26][27] Several years later Cavendish used a very sensitive torsion balance to carry out the Cavendish experiment and determine the average density of Earth.[24]\\r\\nMason and Dixon likely never heard the phrase, \\"Mason-Dixon line\\". The official report on the survey, issued in 1768, did not even mention their names.[6] While the term was used occasionally in the decades following the survey, it came into popular use when the Missouri Compromise named \\"Mason and Dixon's line\\" as part of the boundary between slave territory and free territory.[28]\\r\\nIn popular usage, the MasonÿDixon line symbolizes a cultural boundary between the North and the South (Dixie). Originally \\"Mason and Dixon's Line\\" referred to the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland. After Pennsylvania abolished slavery, it served as a demarcation line for the legality of slavery. That demarcation did not extend beyond Pennsylvania because Delaware, then a slave state, extended north and east of the boundary. Also lying north and east of the boundary was New Jersey, where slavery was formally abolished in 1846, but former slaves continued to be \\"apprenticed\\" to their masters until the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1865.\\r\\nThe Missouri Compromise line had a much clearer geographic connection to slavery in the United States leading up to the Civil War.[29]\\r\\nPopular culture contains a multitude of references to the MasonÿDixon line as a general geographic division, or character names evoking it, although a minority of those specifically relate to the line itself.\\r\\nThe line makes several appearances[33] in the 1953 Bugs Bunny cartoon \\"Southern Fried Rabbit\\".

About 3,800 kamikaze pilots died during the war, and more than 7,000 naval personnel were killed by kamikaze attacks.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\nKamikaze aircraft were essentially pilot-guided explosive missiles, purpose-built or converted from conventional aircraft. Pilots would attempt to crash their aircraft into enemy ships in what was called a \\"body attack\\" in planes laden with some combination of explosives, bombs, torpedoes and full fuel tanks. Accuracy was much better than a conventional attack, and the payload and explosion larger; about 19% of kamikaze attacks were successful.[1] A kamikaze could sustain damage which would disable a conventional attacker and still achieve its objective. The goal of crippling or destroying large numbers of Allied ships, particularly aircraft carriers, was considered by the Empire of Japan to be a just reason for sacrificing pilots and aircraft.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese attacks, which began in October 1944, followed several critical military defeats for the Japanese. They had long since lost aerial dominance due to outdated aircraft and the loss of experienced pilots. Japan suffered from a diminishing capacity for war, and a rapidly declining industrial capacity relative to the Allies.  Japan was also losing pilots faster than it could train their replacements.  In combination, these factors, coupled with the unwillingness to surrender, led to the use of kamikaze tactics as Allied forces advanced towards the Japanese home islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the term kamikaze usually refers to the aerial strikes, it has also been applied to various other suicide attacks. The Japanese military also used or made plans for non-aerial Japanese Special Attack Units, including those involving submarines, human torpedoes, speedboats and divers.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tradition of death instead of defeat, capture, and shame is deeply entrenched in Japanese military culture. One of the primary traditions in the samurai life and the Bushido code: loyalty and honour until death.[3][4][5][6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Japanese word kamikaze is usually translated as \\"divine wind\\" (kami is the word for \\"god\\", \\"spirit\\", or \\"divinity\\", and kaze for \\"wind\\"). The word originated from Makurakotoba of waka poetry modifying \\"Ise\\"[8] and has been used since August 1281 to refer to the major typhoons which dispersed Mongolian invasion fleets under Kublai Khan in 1274.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nA Japanese monoplane which made a record-breaking flight from Tokyo to London in 1937 for the Asahi newspaper group was named Kamikaze. She was a prototype for the Mitsubishi Ki-15 (\\"Babs\\").[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Japanese, the formal term used for units carrying out suicide attacks during 1944ÿ1945 is tokubetsu kgeki tai (?eZ??), which literally means \\"special attack unit\\". This is usually abbreviated to tokktai (Z?). More specifically, air suicide attack units from the Imperial Japanese Navy were officially called shinp tokubetsu kgeki tai (^a?eZ??, \\"divine wind special attack units\\"). Shinp is the on-reading (on'yomi or Chinese-derived pronunciation) of the same characters that form the word kamikaze in Japanese. During World War II, the pronunciation kamikaze was used only informally in the Japanese press in relation to suicide attacks, but after the war this usage gained acceptance worldwide and was re-imported into Japan. As a result, the special attack units are sometimes known in Japan as kamikaze tokubetsu kgeki tai.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the formation of kamikaze units, pilots had made deliberate crashes as a last resort when their planes had suffered severe damage and they did not want to risk being captured, or wanted to do as much damage to the enemy as possible, since they were crashing anyway; such situations occurred in both the Axis and Allied air forces. Axell and Kase see these suicides as \\"individual, impromptu decisions by men who were mentally prepared to die\\".[11] In most cases, little evidence exists that such hits represented more than accidental collisions of the kind that sometimes happen in intense sea or air battles. One example of this occurred on 7 December 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor. First Lieutenant Fusata Iida's plane had taken a hit and had started leaking fuel when he apparently used it to make a suicide attack on Naval Air Station Kaneohe. Before taking off, he had told his men that if his plane were to become badly damaged he would crash it into a \\"worthy enemy target\\".[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe carrier battles in 1942, particularly Midway, inflicted irreparable damage on the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS), such that they could no longer put together a large number of fleet carriers with well-trained aircrews.[13] Japanese planners had assumed a quick war and lacked comprehensive programmes to replace the losses of ships, pilots, and sailors; at Midway in June 1942, the Japanese lost as many aircrewmen in a single day as their pre-war training program had lost in a year.[14] \\r\\nThe following Solomon Islands campaign (1942ÿ1945) and the New Guinea campaign (1942ÿ1945), notably the Battles of Eastern Solomons (August 1942) and Santa Cruz (October 1942), further decimated the IJNAS veteran aircrews, and replacing their combat experience proved impossible.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring 1943ÿ1944, U.S. forces steadily advanced toward Japan. Newer U.S.-made planes, especially the Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair, outclassed and soon outnumbered Japan's fighter planes. Tropical diseases, as well as shortages of spare parts and fuel, made operations more and more difficult for the IJNAS. By the Battle of the Philippine Sea (June 1944) the Japanese had to make do with obsolete aircraft and inexperienced aviators in the fight against better-trained and more experienced US Navy airmen who flew radar-directed combat air patrols. The Japanese lost over 400 carrier-based planes and pilots in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, effectively putting an end to their carriers' potency. Allied aviators called  the action the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 June 1944, planes from the carrier Chiyoda approached a US task group. According to some accounts, two made suicide attacks, one of which hit USS?Indiana.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe important Japanese base of Saipan fell to the Allied forces on 15 July 1944. Its capture provided adequate forward bases which enabled U.S. air forces using the Boeing B-29 Superfortress to strike at the Japanese home islands. After the fall of Saipan, the Japanese High Command predicted that the Allies would try to capture the Philippines, strategically important to Tokyo because of their location between the oilfields of Southeast Asia and Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Motoharu Okamura, in charge of the Tateyama Base in Tokyo, as well as the 341st Air Group Home, was, according to some sources, the first officer to officially propose kamikaze attack tactics. He arranged, with his superiors, the first investigations on the plausibility and mechanisms of intentional suicide attacks on 15 June 1944.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August 1944, it was announced by the Domei news agency that a flight instructor named Takeo Tagata was training pilots in Taiwan for suicide missions.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne source claims that the first kamikaze mission occurred on 13 September 1944. A group of pilots from the army's 31st Fighter Squadron on Negros Island decided to launch a suicide attack the following morning.[19] First Lieutenant Takeshi Kosai and a sergeant were selected. Two 100?kg (220?lb) bombs were attached to two fighters, and the pilots took off before dawn, planning to crash into carriers. They never returned, but there is no record of an enemy plane hitting an Allied ship that day.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some sources, on 14 October 1944, USS?Reno was hit by a deliberately crashed Japanese plane.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nRear Admiral Masafumi Arima, the commander of the 26th Air Flotilla (part of the 11th Air Fleet), is sometimes credited with inventing the kamikaze tactic. Arima personally led an attack by about 100 Yokosuka D4Y Suisei (\\"Judy\\") dive bombers against a large Essex-class aircraft carrier, USS?Franklin, near Leyte Gulf, on (or about, accounts vary) 15 October 1944. Arima was killed and part of a plane hit Franklin. The Japanese high command and propagandists seized on Arima's example: He was promoted posthumously to Vice Admiral and was given official credit for making the first kamikaze attack. It is not clear that this was a planned suicide attack, and official Japanese accounts of Arima's attack bore little resemblance to the actual events.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 17 October 1944, Allied forces assaulted Suluan Island, beginning the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Imperial Japanese Navy's 1st Air Fleet, based at Manila, was assigned the task of assisting the Japanese ships which would attempt to destroy Allied forces in Leyte Gulf. That unit had only 40 aircraft: 34 Mitsubishi A6M Zero carrier-based fighters, three Nakajima B6N Tenzan (\\"Jill\\") torpedo bombers, one Mitsubishi G4M (\\"Betty\\") and two Yokosuka P1Y Ginga (\\"Frances\\") land-based bombers, and one additional reconnaissance aircraft. The task facing the Japanese air forces seemed impossible. The 1st Air Fleet commandant, Vice Admiral Takijir nishi, decided to form a suicide offensive force, the Special Attack Unit. In a meeting at Mabalacat Airfield (known to the U.S. military as Clark Air Base) near Manila, on 19 October, Onishi told officers of the 201st Flying Group headquarters: \\"I don't think there would be any other certain way to carry out the operation [to hold the Philippines], than to put a 250?kg bomb on a Zero and let it crash into a U.S. carrier, in order to disable her for a week.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCommander Asaichi Tamai asked a group of 23 talented student pilots, all of whom he had trained, to volunteer for the special attack force. All of the pilots raised both of their hands, volunteering to join the operation. Later, Tamai asked Lieutenant Yukio Seki to command the special attack force. Seki is said to have closed his eyes, lowered his head and thought for 10 seconds, before saying: \\"Please do appoint me to the post.\\" Seki became the 24th kamikaze pilot to be chosen. Seki later said: \\"Japan's future is bleak if it is forced to kill one of its best pilots\\" and \\"I am not going on this mission for the Emperor or for the Empire?... I am going because I was ordered to.\\"[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe names of four sub-units within the Kamikaze Special Attack Force were Unit Shikishima, Unit Yamato, Unit Asahi, and Unit Yamazakura.[22] These names were taken from a patriotic death poem, Shikishima no Yamato-gokoro wo hito towaba, asahi ni niou yamazakura bana by the Japanese classical scholar, Motoori Norinaga.[23]  The poem reads:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone asks about the Yamato spirit [Spirit of Old/True Japan] of Shikishima [a poetic name for Japan]it is the flowers of yamazakura [mountain cherry blossom] that are fragrant in the Asahi [rising sun].\\r\\n\\r\\nA less literal translation[24] is:\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked about the soul of Japan,\\r\\nI would say\\r\\nThat it is\\r\\nLike wild cherry blossoms\\r\\nGlowing in the morning sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nnishi, addressing this unit, told them that their nobility of spirit would keep the homeland from ruin even in defeat.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral suicide attacks, carried out during the invasion of Leyte, by Japanese pilots from units other than the Special Attack Force, have been described as the first kamikaze attack. Early on 21 October, a Japanese aircraft, possibly a Navy Aichi D3A dive-bomber[26] or an Army Mitsubishi Ki-51 (of the 6th Flying Brigade, Imperial Japanese Army Air Force[27]) deliberately crashed into the foremast of the heavy cruiser HMAS?Australia.[26] The attack killed 30 personnel, including the cruiser's captain, Emile Dechaineux, and wounded 64, including the Australian force commander, Commodore John Collins.[26] The Australian official history of the war claimed that this was the first kamikaze attack on an Allied ship, although other sources disagree because it was not a planned attack by a member of the Special Attack Force, but was most likely to have been undertaken on the pilot's own initiative.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sinking of the ocean tug USS?Sonoma on 24 October is listed in some sources as the first ship lost to a kamikaze strike, but the attack occurred before 25 October, and the aircraft used, a Mitsubishi G4M, was not flown by the original four Special Attack Squadrons.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 25 October 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Kamikaze Special Attack Force carried out its first mission. Five A6M Zeros, led by Seki, and escorted to the target by leading Japanese ace Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, attacked several escort carriers. One Zero attempted to hit the bridge of USS?Kitkun Bay but instead exploded on the port catwalk and cartwheeled into the sea. Two others dived at USS?Fanshaw Bay but were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. The last two ran at USS?White Plains. One, under heavy fire and trailing smoke, aborted the attempt on White Plains and instead banked toward USS?St. Lo, plowing into the flight deck. Its bomb caused fires that resulted in the bomb magazine exploding, sinking the carrier.[28] By day's end on 26 October, 55 kamikazes from the Special Attack Force had also damaged the large escort carriers USS?Sangamon, Suwannee which had also been struck\\r\\nby a kamikaze at 08:04 forward of its aft elevator on 25 October, Santee, and the smaller escorts USS White Plains, Kalinin Bay, and Kitkun Bay. In total, seven carriers were hit, as well as 40 other ships (five sunk, 23 heavily damaged, and 12 moderately damaged).\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly successes ÿ such as the sinking of St. Lo ÿ were followed by an immediate expansion of the program, and over the next few months over 2,000 planes made such attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Japan began to be subject to intense strategic bombing by Boeing B-29 Superfortresses, the Japanese military attempted to use suicide attacks against this threat. During the northern hemisphere winter of 1944ÿ45, the IJAAF formed the 47th Air Regiment, also known as the Shinten Special Unit (Shinten Seiku Tai) at Narimasu Airfield, Nerima, Tokyo, to defend the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The unit was equipped with Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (\\"Tojo\\") fighters, with which they were to ram United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29s in their attacks on Japan. This proved much less successful and practical since an airplane is a much faster, more maneuverable, and smaller target than a warship. The B-29 also had formidable defensive weaponry, so suicide attacks against the plane demanded considerable piloting skill to be successful, which worked against the very purpose of using expendable pilots. Even encouraging capable pilots to bail out before impact was ineffective because vital personnel were often lost when they mistimed their exits and were killed as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 11 March, the U.S. carrier USS?Randolph was hit and moderately damaged at Ulithi Atoll, in the Caroline Islands, by a kamikaze that had flown almost 4,000?km (2,500?mi) from Japan, in a mission called Operation Tan No. 2. On 20 March, the submarine USS?Devilfish survived a hit from an aircraft, just off Japan.\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose-built kamikaze planes, as opposed to converted fighters and dive-bombers, were also being constructed. Ensign Mitsuo Ohta had suggested that piloted glider bombs, carried within range of targets by a mother plane, should be developed. The First Naval Air Technical Bureau (Kugisho), in Yokosuka, refined Ohta's idea. Yokosuka MXY-7 Ohka rocket planes, launched from bombers, were first deployed in kamikaze attacks from March 1945. U.S. personnel gave them the derisive nickname \\"Baka Bombs\\" (baka is Japanese for \\"idiot\\" or \\"stupid\\"). The Nakajima Ki-115 Tsurugi was a simple, easily built propeller aircraft with a wooden airframe which used engines from existing stocks. Its non-retractable landing gear was jettisoned shortly after take-off for a suicide mission, and re-used. During 1945, the Japanese military began stockpiling hundreds of Tsurugi, other aircraft, Ohkas, and suicide boats, for use against Allied forces expected to invade Japan. The invasion never happened, and few were ever used.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early 1945 U.S. Navy aviator Commander John Thach, already famous for developing effective aerial tactics against the Japanese such as the Thach Weave, developed a defensive strategy against kamikazes called the \\"big blue blanket\\" to establish Allied air supremacy well away from the carrier force. This recommended combat air patrols (CAP) which were larger and operated further from the carriers than before, a line of picket destroyers and destroyer escorts at least 80?km (50?mi) from the main body of the fleet to provide earlier radar interception, and improved coordination between fighter direction officers on carriers. This plan also called for around-the-clock fighter patrols over Allied fleets, though the U.S. Navy had cut back training of fighter pilots so there were not enough Navy pilots available to counter the kamikaze threat. A final element included intensive fighter sweeps over Japanese airfields, and bombing of Japanese runways, using delayed action bombs to make repairs more difficult.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nLate in 1944 the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) used the good high-altitude performance of their Supermarine Seafires (naval version of the Spitfire) on combat air patrol duties. Seafires were heavily involved in countering the kamikaze attacks during the Iwo Jima landings and beyond. The Seafires' best day was 15 August 1945, shooting down eight attacking aircraft for a single loss.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllied pilots were experienced and better-trained, and flew superior aircraft, making the poorly trained kamikaze pilots easy targets. The U.S. Fast Carrier Task Force alone could bring over 1,000 fighter aircraft into play. Allied pilots became adept at destroying enemy aircraft before they struck ships.\\r\\n\\r\\nAllied gunners had begun to develop techniques to negate kamikaze attacks. Light rapid fire anti-aircraft weapons such as the 40?mm Bofors and 20?mm Oerlikon autocannons were highly effective,[31] but heavy anti-aircraft guns such as the 5\\"/38 caliber gun (127?mm) had the punch to blow kamikazes out of the air, which was preferable since even a heavily damaged kamikaze could complete its mission.[32]  The Ohkas with their high speed presented a very difficult problem for anti-aircraft fire, since their velocity made fire control extremely difficult. By 1945, large numbers of anti-aircraft shells with radio frequency proximity fuzes, on average seven times more effective than regular shells, became available, and the USN recommended their use against kamikaze attacks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe peak in kamikaze attacks came during the period of AprilÿJune 1945, at the Battle of Okinawa. On 6 April 1945, waves of aircraft made hundreds of attacks in Operation Kikusui (\\"floating chrysanthemums\\").[33] At Okinawa, kamikaze attacks focused at first on Allied destroyers on picket duty, and then on the carriers in the middle of the fleet. Suicide attacks by planes or boats at Okinawa sank or put out of action at least 30 U.S. warships,[34] and at least three U.S. merchant ships,[35] along with some from other Allied forces. The attacks expended 1,465 planes. Many warships of all classes were damaged, some severely, but no aircraft carriers, battleships or cruisers were sunk by kamikaze at Okinawa. Most of the ships lost were destroyers or smaller vessels, especially those on picket duty.[34] The destroyer USS?Laffey earned the nickname \\"The Ship That Would Not Die\\" after surviving six kamikaze attacks and four bomb hits during this battle.[36] So many destroyers were attacked that one ship's crew, considering the aircraft carriers to be more important targets, erected a large sign with an arrow which read \\"That way to the carriers\\".[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nU.S. carriers, with their wooden flight decks, appeared to suffer more damage from kamikaze hits than the armored-decked carriers from the British Pacific Fleet. US carriers also suffered considerably heavier casualties from kamikaze strikes; for instance, 389 men were killed in one attack on USS?Bunker Hill, greater than the combined number of fatalities suffered on all six Royal Navy armoured carriers from all forms of attack during the entire war (Bunker Hill and Franklin were both hit while conducting operations with fully fueled and armed aircraft spotted on deck for takeoff, an extremely vulnerable state for any carrier). Eight kamikaze hits on five British carriers resulted in only 20 deaths while a combined total of 15 bomb hits, most of 500?kg weight or greater, and one torpedo hit on four carriers caused 193 fatal casualties earlier in the war ÿ striking proof of the protective value of the armoured flight deck.[37][38]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resilience of well-armoured vessels was shown on 4 May, just after 11:30, when there was a wave of suicide attacks against the British Pacific Fleet. One Japanese plane made a steep dive from \\"a great height\\" at the carrier HMS?Formidable and was engaged by AA guns.[39] Although it was hit by gunfire, a bomb from the kamikaze detonated on the flight deck, making a crater 3?m (9.8?ft) long, 0.6?m (2?ft) wide and 0.6?m (2?ft) deep. A long steel splinter speared down, through the hangar deck and the main boiler room (where it ruptured a steam line), before coming to rest in a fuel tank near the aircraft park, where it started a major fire. Eight personnel were killed and 47 were wounded. One Corsair and 10 Grumman Avengers were destroyed. The fires were gradually brought under control, and the crater in the deck was repaired with concrete and steel plate. By 17:00, Corsairs were able to land. On 9 May, Formidable was again damaged by a kamikaze, as were the carrier HMS?Victorious and the battleship HMS?Howe. The British were able to clear the flight deck and resume flight operations in just hours, while their American counterparts took a few days or even months, as observed by a USN liaison officer on HMS?Indefatigable who commented: \\"When a kamikaze hits a U.S. carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl [Harbor]. When a kamikaze hits a Limey carrier its just a case of 'Sweepers, man your brooms'.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes twin-engined aircraft were used in planned kamikaze attacks. For example, Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiry (\\"Peggy\\") medium bombers, based on Formosa, undertook kamikaze attacks on Allied forces off Okinawa and a pair of Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (\\"Nick\\") heavy fighters caused enough damage for the USS Dickerson (DD-157) to be scuttled.\\r\\n\\r\\nVice Admiral Matome Ugaki, the commander of the IJN 5th Air Fleet based in Kyushu, participated in one of the final kamikaze attacks on American ships on 15 August 1945, hours after Japan's announced surrender.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the end of the war approached, the Allies did not suffer more serious significant losses, despite having far more ships and facing a greater intensity of kamikaze attacks. Although causing some of the heaviest casualties on US carriers in 1945, the IJN had sacrificed 2,525 kamikaze pilots and the IJAAF 1,387far more than they had lost in 1942 when they sank or crippled three carriers (albeit without inflicting significant casualties). In 1942 when US Navy vessels were scarce, the temporary absence of key warships from the combat zone would tie up operational initiatives. By 1945, however the US Navy was large enough that damaged ships could be detached back home for repair without significantly hampering the fleet's operational capability. The only surface losses were destroyers and smaller ships that lacked the capability to sustain heavy damage. Overall, the kamikazes were unable to turn the tide of the war and stop the Allied invasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the immediate aftermath of kamikaze strikes, British carriers with their armoured flight decks recovered more quickly compared to their US counterparts. Post-war analysis showed that some British carriers such as HMS Formidable suffered structural damage that led to them being scrapped, as being beyond economic repair. Britain's post-war economic situation played a role in the decision to not repair damaged carriers, while even seriously damaged American carriers such as USS Bunker Hill were repaired, although they were then mothballed or sold off as surplus after World War II without re-entering service.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact number of ships sunk is a matter of debate. According to a wartime Japanese propaganda announcement, the missions sank 81 ships and damaged 195, and according to a Japanese tally, kamikaze attacks accounted for up to 80% of the U.S. losses in the final phase of the war in the Pacific. In a 2004 book, World War II, the historians Wilmott, Cross and Messenger stated that more than 70 U.S. vessels were \\"sunk or damaged beyond repair\\" by kamikazes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a U.S. Air Force webpage:\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 2,800 Kamikaze attackers sank 34 Navy ships, damaged 368 others, killed 4,900 sailors, and wounded over 4,800. Despite radar detection and cuing, airborne interception, attrition, and massive anti-aircraft barrages, 14 percent of Kamikazes survived to score a hit on a ship; nearly 8.5 percent of all ships hit by Kamikazes sank.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAustralian journalists Denis and Peggy Warner, in a 1982 book with Japanese naval historian Sadao Seno (The Sacred Warriors: Japans Suicide Legions), arrived at a total of 57 ships sunk by kamikazes. Bill Gordon, an American Japanologist who specialises in kamikazes, lists in a 2007 article 47 ships known to have been sunk by kamikaze aircraft. Gordon says that the Warners and Seno included ten ships that did not sink. He lists:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was claimed by the Japanese forces at the time that there were many volunteers for the suicidal forces. Captain Motoharu Okamura commented that \\"there were so many volunteers for suicide missions that he referred to them as a swarm of bees\\", explaining: \\"Bees die after they have stung.\\"[42] Okamura is credited with being the first to propose the kamikaze attacks. He had expressed his desire to lead a volunteer group of suicide attacks some four months before Admiral Takijiro Ohnishi, commander of the Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines, presented the idea to his staff. While Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome, commander of the second air fleet, was inspecting the 341st Air Group, Captain Okamura took the chance to express his ideas on crash-dive tactics. \\"In our present situation I firmly believe that the only way to swing the war in our favor is to resort to crash-dive attacks with our planes. There is no other way. There will be more than enough volunteers for this chance to save our country, and I would like to command such an operation. Provide me with 300 planes and I will turn the tide of war.\\"[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the volunteers arrived for duty in the corps, there were twice as many persons as aircraft available. \\"After the war, some commanders would express regret for allowing superfluous crews to accompany sorties, sometimes squeezing themselves aboard bombers and fighters so as to encourage the suicide pilots and, it seems, join in the exultation of sinking a large enemy vessel.\\" Many of the kamikaze pilots believed their death would pay the debt they owed and show the love they had for their families, friends, and emperor. \\"So eager were many minimally trained pilots to take part in suicide missions that when their sorties were delayed or aborted, the pilots became deeply despondent. Many of those who were selected for a bodycrashing mission were described as being extraordinarily blissful immediately before their final sortie.\\"[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs time wore on, modern critics questioned the nationalist portrayal of kamikaze pilots as noble soldiers willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. In 2006, Tsuneo Watanabe, Editor-in-Chief of the Yomiuri Shimbun, criticized Japanese nationalists' glorification of kamikaze attacks:[45][46][47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's all a lie that they left filled with braveness and joy, crying, \\"Long live the emperor!\\" They were sheep at a slaughterhouse. Everybody was looking down and tottering. Some were unable to stand up and were carried and pushed into the plane by maintenance soldiers.\\r\\nWhen you eliminate all thoughts about life and death, you will be able to totally disregard your earthly life. This will also enable you to concentrate your attention on eradicating the enemy with unwavering determination, meanwhile reinforcing your excellence in flight skills.\\r\\nTokktai pilot training, as described by Takeo Kasuga,[48] generally \\"consisted of incredibly strenuous training, coupled with cruel and torturous corporal punishment as a daily routine\\". Daikichi Irokawa, who trained at Tsuchiura Naval Air Base, recalled that he \\"was struck on the face so hard and frequently that [his] face was no longer recognizable\\". He also wrote: \\"I was hit so hard that I could no longer see and fell on the floor. The minute I got up, I was hit again by a club so that I would confess.\\" This brutal \\"training\\" was justified by the idea that it would instill a \\"soldier's fighting spirit\\", but daily beatings and corporal punishment eliminated patriotism among many pilots.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nPilots were given a manual which detailed how they were supposed to think, prepare and attack. From this manual, pilots were told to \\"attain a high level of spiritual training\\", and to \\"keep [their] health in the very best condition\\". These things, among others, were meant to put the pilot into the mindset in which he would be mentally ready to die.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tokktai pilot's manual also explained how a pilot may turn back if the pilot could not locate a target and that \\"[a pilot] should not waste [his] life lightly\\".  One pilot who continually came back to base was shot after his ninth return.[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIrokawa Daikichi, Kamikaze Diaries: Reflections of Japanese Student Soldiers\\r\\n\\r\\nThe manual was very detailed in how a pilot should attack. A pilot would dive towards his target and \\"aim for a point between the bridge tower and the smoke stacks\\". Entering a smoke stack was also said to be \\"effective\\". Pilots were told not to aim at a ship's bridge tower or gun turret but instead to look for elevators or the flight deck to crash into. For horizontal attacks, the pilot was to \\"aim at the middle of the vessel, slightly higher than the waterline\\" or to \\"aim at the entrance to the aircraft hangar, or the bottom of the stack\\" if the former was too difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tokktai pilot's manual told pilots never to close their eyes. This was because if a pilot closed his eyes he would lower the chances of hitting his target. In the final moments before the crash, the pilot was to yell \\"Hissatsu\\" (??) at the top of his lungs which translates to \\"Certain Kill\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1944ÿ45, American propagandists invented the term \\"State Shinto\\" to differentiate the Japanese state's ideology from traditional Shinto practices. As time went on, Americans claimed, Shinto was used increasingly in the promotion of nationalist sentiment. In 1890, the Imperial Rescript on Education was passed, under which students were required to ritually recite its oath to offer themselves \\"courageously to the State\\" as well as protect the Imperial family. The ultimate offering was to give up ones life. It was an honour to die for Japan and the Emperor. Axell and Kase pointed out: \\"The fact is that innumerable soldiers, sailors and pilots were determined to die, to become eirei, that is 'guardian spirits' of the country. ... Many Japanese felt that to be enshrined at Yasukuni was a special honour because the Emperor visited the shrine to pay homage twice a year. Yasukuni is the only shrine deifying common men which the Emperor would visit to pay his respects.\\"[42] Young Japanese people were indoctrinated from an earliest age with these ideals.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the commencement of the kamikaze tactic, newspapers and books ran advertisements, articles, and stories regarding the suicide bombers, to aid in recruiting and support. In October 1944, the Nippon Times quoted Lieutenant Sekio Nishina: \\"The spirit of the Special Attack Corps is the great spirit that runs in the blood of every Japanese ... The crashing action which simultaneously kills the enemy and oneself without fail is called the Special Attack ... Every Japanese is capable of becoming a member of the Special Attack Corps.\\"[50] Publishers also played up the idea that the kamikaze were enshrined at Yasukuni and ran exaggerated stories of kamikaze bravery ÿ there were even fairy tales for little children that promoted the kamikaze. A Foreign Office official named Toshikazu Kase said: \\"It was customary for GHQ [in Tokyo] to make false announcements of victory in utter disregard of facts, and for the elated and complacent public to believe them.\\"[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile many stories were falsified, some were true, such as the story of Kiyu Ishikawa who saved a Japanese ship when he crashed his plane into a torpedo that an American submarine had launched. The sergeant major was posthumously promoted to second lieutenant by the emperor and was enshrined at Yasukuni.[52] Stories like these, which showed the kind of praise and honour death produced, encouraged young Japanese to volunteer for the Special Attack Corps and instilled a desire in the youth to die as a kamikaze.\\r\\n\\r\\nCeremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission. The Kamikaze shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as \\"mizu no sakazuki\\". Many Army officer Kamikaze took their swords with them, while the Navy pilots (as a general rule) did not carry swords in their planes. The kamikaze, like all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory, were issued (or purchased, if they were officers) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured. Like all Army and Navy servicemen, the Kamikaze would wear their senninbari, a \\"belt of a thousand stitches\\" given to them by their mothers.[53] They also composed and read a death poem, a tradition stemming from the samurai, who did it before committing seppuku. Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations. The Kamikaze were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect the Kamikaze to their destination and report on the results. Some of these escort pilots, such as Zero pilot Toshimitsu Imaizumi, were themselves later sent out on their own Kamikaze missions.[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile it is commonly perceived that volunteers signed up in droves for kamikaze missions, it has also been contended that there was extensive coercion and peer pressure involved in recruiting soldiers for the sacrifice. Their motivations in \\"volunteering\\" were complex and not simply about patriotism or bringing honour to their families. Firsthand interviews with surviving Kamikaze pilots and escort pilots has revealed that they were motivated by a desire to protect their families from perceived atrocities and possible extinction at the hands of the Allies. They viewed themselves as the last defense.[54]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt least one of these pilots was a conscripted Korean with a Japanese name, adopted under the pre-war Soshi-kaimei ordinance that compelled Koreans to take Japanese personal names.[55] Eleven of the 1,036 IJA kamikaze pilots who died in sorties from Chiran and other Japanese air bases during the Battle of Okinawa were Koreans.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that young pilots on kamikaze missions often flew southwest from Japan over the 922?m (3,025?ft) Mount Kaimon. The mountain is also called \\"Satsuma Fuji\\" (meaning a mountain like Mount Fuji but located in the Satsuma Province region). Suicide mission pilots looked over their shoulders to see this, the most southern mountain on the Japanese mainland, while they were in the air, said farewell to their country, and saluted the mountain. Residents on Kikaishima Island, east of Amami shima, say that pilots from suicide mission units dropped flowers from the air as they departed on their final missions.\\r\\n\\r\\nKamikaze pilots who were unable to complete their mission (due to mechanical failure, interception, etc.) were stigmatized in the years following the war. This stigma began to diminish some 50 years after the war as scholars and publishers have distributed the survivors' stories.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome Japanese military personnel were critical of the policy. Some officers, Minoru Genda, Tadashi Minobe and Yoshio Shiga, refused to obey the policy. They said that the commander of a kamikaze attack should engage in the task first.[57][58] Some persons who obeyed the policy, Kiyokuma Okajima, Saburo Shindo, and Iyozo Fujita, were also critical of the policy.[59][60] Sabur Sakai said: \\"We never dared to question orders, to doubt authority, to do anything but immediately carry out all the commands of our superiors. We were automatons who obeyed without thinking.\\"[61] Tetsuzo Iwamoto refused to engage in a kamikaze attack because he thought the task of fighter pilots was to shoot down aircraft.[62]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot predict the outcome of the air battles, but you will be making a mistake if you should regard Special Attack operations as normal methods. The right way is to attack the enemy with skill and return to the base with good results. A plane should be utilized over and over again. Thats the way to fight a war. The current thinking is skewed. Otherwise, you cannot expect to improve air power. There will be no progress if flyers continue to die.\\r\\nZwei Seelen wohnen auch in mein[em] Herz[en]!! (Ah, two souls [tamashii] reside in my heart [kokoro]!!) After all I am just a human being. Sometimes, my chest pounds with excitement when I think of the day I will fly into the sky. I trained my mind and body as hard as I could and am anxious for the day I can use them to their full capacity in fighting. I think my life and death belong to the mission. Yet, at other times, I envy those science majors who remain at home [exempt from the draft].  One of my souls looks to heaven, while the other is attracted to the earth. I wish to enter the Navy as soon as possible so that I can devote myself to the task. I hope that the days when I am tormented by stupid thoughts will pass quickly.\\r\\nIt is easy to talk about death in the abstract, as the ancient philosophers discussed. But it is real death I fear, and I dont know if I can overcome the fear. Even for a short life, there are many memories. For someone who had a good life, it is very difficult to part with it. But I reached a point of no return. I must plunge into an enemy vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTo be honest, I cannot say that the wish to die for the emperor is genuine, coming from my heart. However, it is decided for me that I die for the emperor.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am pleased to have the honour of having been chosen as a member of a Special Attack Force that is on its way into battle, but I cannot help crying when I think of you, Mum.

We watched each plunging kamikaze with the detached horror of one witnessing a terrible spectacle rather than as the intended victim. We forgot self for the moment as we groped hopelessly for the thought of that other man up there.","input":"What was the main target of the japanese kamikaze pilots?"},{"output":"Episcopal Church","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington, commonly known as Washington National Cathedral, is a cathedral of the Episcopal Church located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States.[1][2] The structure is of Neo-Gothic design closely modeled on English Gothic style of the late fourteenth century. It is both the second-largest church building in the United States,[3] and the fourth-tallest structure in Washington, D.C. The cathedral is the seat of both the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, Michael Bruce Curry, and the Bishop of the Diocese of Washington, Mariann Edgar Budde. Over 270,000 people visit the structure annually.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation, under the first seven Bishops of Washington, erected the cathedral under a charter passed by the United States Congress on January 6, 1893.[5] Construction began on September 29, 1907, when the foundation stone was laid in the presence of President Theodore Roosevelt and a crowd of more than 20,000, and ended 83 years later when the \\"final finial\\" was placed in the presence of President George H. W. Bush in 1990. Decorative work, such as carvings and statuary, is ongoing as of 2011. The Foundation is the legal entity of which all institutions on the Cathedral Close are a part; its corporate staff provides services for the institutions to help enable their missions, conducts work of the Foundation itself that is not done by the other entities, and serves as staff for the Board of Trustees.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cathedral stands at Massachusetts and Wisconsin Avenues in the northwest quadrant of Washington. It is an associate member of the recently organized inter-denominational Washington Theological Consortium.[6] It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, it was ranked third on the List of America's Favorite Architecture by the American Institute of Architects.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1792, Pierre L'Enfant's \\"Plan of the Federal City\\" set aside land for a \\"great church for national purposes.\\" The National Portrait Gallery now occupies that site. In 1891, a meeting was held to renew plans for a national cathedral. On January 6, 1893, the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation of the District of Columbia was granted a charter from Congress to establish the cathedral. The 52nd United States Congress declared in the act to incorporate the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation of the District of Columbia that the \\"said corporation is hereby empowered to establish and maintain within the District of Columbia a cathedral and institutions of learning for the promotion of religion and education and charity.\\"[8] The commanding site on Mount Saint Alban was chosen. Henry Yates Satterlee, first Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese of Washington, chose George Frederick Bodley, Britain's leading Anglican church architect, as the head architect. Henry Vaughan was selected supervising architect.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstruction started September 29, 1907, with a ceremonial address by President Theodore Roosevelt and the laying of the cornerstone. In 1912, Bethlehem Chapel opened for services in the unfinished cathedral, which have continued daily ever since. When construction of the cathedral resumed after a brief hiatus for World War I, both Bodley and Vaughan had died. Gen. John J. Pershing led fundraising efforts for the church after World War I. American architect Philip Hubert Frohman took over the design of the cathedral and was thenceforth designated the principal architect. Funding for the National Cathedral has come entirely from private sources. Maintenance and upkeep continue to rely entirely upon private support.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom its earliest days, the cathedral has been promoted as more than simply an Episcopal cathedral. Planners hoped it would play a role similar to England's Westminster Abbey. They wanted it to be a national shrine and a venue for great services. For much of the cathedral's history, this was captured in the phrase \\"a house of prayer for all people.\\" In more recent times the phrases \\"national house of prayer\\" and \\"spiritual home for the nation have been used. The cathedral has achieved this status simply by offering itself and being accepted by religious and political leaders as playing this role.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIts initial charter was similar to those granted to American University, Catholic University of America, and other not-for-profit entities founded in the District of Columbia around 1900. Contrary to popular misconception, the government has not designated it as a national house of prayer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, monthly services were held there \\"on behalf of a united people in a time of emergency.\\" Before and since, the structure has hosted other major events, both religious and secular, that have drawn the attention of the American people, as well as tourists from around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nState funerals for three American Presidents have been held at the cathedral:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial services were also held at the cathedral for the following presidents:[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nPresidential prayer services were held the day after the inaugurations for the following Presidents.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther events include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was from Washington National Cathedral's \\"Canterbury Pulpit\\" that the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his final Sunday sermon on March 31, 1968, just a few days before his assassination in April 1968.[16] A memorial service for King was held at the cathedral later the same week.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cathedral was damaged in August 2011 during the Virginia earthquake. Finial stones on several pinnacles broke off, and several pinnacles twisted out of alignment or collapsed entirely. Some gargoyles and other carvings were damaged, and a hole was punched through the metal-clad roof by falling masonry. Cracks also appeared in the flying buttresses surrounding the apse. Inside, initial inspections revealed less damage, with some mortar joints loose or falling out.[17] The cathedral, which had no earthquake insurance, struggled to cope with the cost of the damage.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nWashington National Cathedral closed from August 24 to November 7, 2011,[17] as $2 million was spent to stabilize the structure and remove damaged or loose stone.[18] Safety netting was erected throughout the nave to protect visitors from any debris that might fall from above.[19] The cathedral reopened for the consecration and installation of Mariann Budde as the ninth Bishop of Washington on November 12, 2011.[20] At that time, estimates of the cost of the damage were about $25 million.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nIdentifying the full extent of the damage and construction planning and studies over the next two years consumed another $2.5 million.[18] In 2011, the cathedral received a $700,000 preservation work matching grant from the Save America's Treasures program, a public-private partnership operated by the nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation. The program, which is federally funded, required the cathedral to match the grant dollar-for-dollar with private funds and use the money solely for preservation work.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Reverend Canon Gary R. Hall was chosen to be the 10th dean of Washington National Cathedral in July 2012.[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough fundraising to repair the damage began soon after the earthquake, it took the cathedral three years to raise the $15 million to complete the first phase of repairs.[18] In August 2013, the cost of the repairs was re-estimated at $26 million. About $10 million had already been raised by this date to pay for the repairs, half of that coming from the Lilly Endowment.[23] The cathedral began charging a $10 admission fee for tourists in January 2014, and started renting out its worship and other spaces to outside groups to raise cash.[24] The cathedral also transformed the Herb Cottage (its old baptistry building adjacent to the cathedral) into a for-profit coffeehouse operated by the Open City caf chain.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhase I of the restoration, which cost $10 million,[18] repaired the internal ceiling's stone and mortar and was completed in February 2015. The planned 10-year, $22 million Phase II will repair or replace the damaged stones atop the cathedral.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2015, Washington National Cathedral leaders said the church needed $200 million, which would both complete repairs and establish a foundation to give the cathedral financial stability. The cathedral began working on a capital fundraising campaign, which The New York Times said was one of the largest ever by an American religious institution, to begin in 2018 or 2019. Hall said that the cathedral also planned to reopen its continuing education college and its Center for Prayer and Pilgrimage (a space on the cathedral's crypt level dedicated to prayer, meditation, and devotional practice). After three years of deficit spending, however, the cathedral also announced additional cuts to music programs to balance its budget.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2016, after an examination by a five-person task force it was announced that two Confederate battle flag images would be removed from stained glass windows commemorating the lives of Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.  The windows were installed in 1953 after lobbying by the United Daughters of the Confederacy. In its report, the task force wrote that it \\"is unanimous in its decision that the windows provide a catalyst for honest discussions about race and the legacy of slavery and for addressing the uncomfortable and too often avoided issues of race in America. Moreover, the windows serve as a profound witness to the Cathedral's own complex history in relationship to race.\\"[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 6, 2017, the Cathedral, in a statement signed by the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, Dean of the Cathedral, and John Donoghue, Chair of the Cathedral Chapter, announced its decision to deconsecrate and remove the stained glass windows honoring Lee and Jackson.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2003, the Reverend Nathan D. Baxter, dean of the cathedral, announced his retirement effective from June 30, 2003. Baxter had led the cathedral since 1991.[29] After an 18-month search, Samuel T. Lloyd III was named dean and began his tenure on April 23, 2005. [30] Using a $15 million bequest the cathedral received in 2000, Lloyd rapidly expanded the cathedral's programming.[31][18] Meanwhile, the cathedral deferred maintenance and declined to make needed repairs.[18] Construction also began in summer 2005 on a $34 million, four-level, 430-car underground parking garage. It opened in 2007.[32][18] The structure was pushed by John Bryson Chane, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, and was mostly funded by debt. Payments on the garage were $500,000 per year, with a major increase in the annual debt service beginning in 2017.[33] In early 2008, the National Cathedral Association, the church's fundraising donor network, was disbanded after cathedral leaders concluded that the building was \\"finished\\" and it was no longer necessary to raise significant funds for construction.[18][34]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2008ÿ2009 Great Recession hit the cathedral hard. By June 2010, the cathedral cut its budget from $27 million to $13 million, outsourced the operation of its gift shop, shut its greenhouse, cancelled its plans to replace the Skinner organ in the sanctuary, and ceased operation of a college that had provided Episcopal clergy nationwide with continuing theological education. The cathedral also laid off 100 of its 170 staff members, including its art conservator and its liturgist (who researched and advocated the use of liturgies at the cathedral).[35] It also significantly cut back on programming, music performances, and classes.[36] To help stabilize its finances, the cathedral began an $11 million fundraising campaign and used $2.5 million of its $50 million endowment to plug budget holes.[35] The National Cathedral Association was recreated as well.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2010, the cathedral announced that it was exploring the sale of its rare book collection, the value of which was estimated to be several million dollars.[35] It sold a number of books to a private collector in 2011 for $857,0000[18] and in 2013 donated most of the remaining collection to Virginia Theological Seminary.[18][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the economic downturn continued, a report by cathedral staff identified $30 million in needed maintenance and repairs.[18] Among the problems were cracked and missing mortar in the oldest sections of the building; broken HVAC, mechanical, and plumbing systems throughout the structure; extensive preservation needs; and a main organ in disrepair. Repointing the building was estimated to cost at least $5 million, while organ repair was set at $15 million.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cathedral's final design shows a mix of influences from the various Gothic architectural styles of the Middle Ages, identifiable in its pointed arches, flying buttresses, a variety of ceiling vaulting, stained-glass windows and carved decorations in stone, and by its three similar towers, two on the west front and one surmounting the crossing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe structure consists of a long, narrow rectangular mass formed by a nine-bay nave with wide side aisles and a five-bay chancel, intersected by a six bay transept. Above the crossing, rising 301?ft (92?m) above the ground, is the Gloria in Excelsis Tower; its top, at 676?ft (206?m) above sea level, is the highest point in Washington.[3] The Pilgrim Observation Gallerywhich occupies a space about 3/4ths of the way up in the west-end towersprovides sweeping views of the city. Unique in North America, the central tower has two full sets of bellsa 53-bell carillon and a 10-bell peal for change ringing; the change bells are rung by members of the Washington Ringing Society.[3] The cathedral sits on a landscaped 57-acre (23?ha) plot on Mount Saint Alban.[3] The one-story porch projecting from the south transept has a large portal with a carved tympanum. This portal is approached by the Pilgrim Steps, a long flight of steps 40 feet (12?m) wide.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the building is constructed using a buff-colored Indiana limestone over a traditional masonry core. Structural, load-bearing steel is limited to the roof's trusses (traditionally built of timber); concrete is used significantly in the support structures for bells of the central tower, and the floors in the west towers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pulpit was carved out of stones from Canterbury Cathedral; Glastonbury Abbey provided stone for the bishop's formal seat, the cathedra. The high altar, the Jerusalem Altar, is made from stones quarried at Solomon's Quarry near Jerusalem, reputedly where the stones for Solomon's Temple were quarried. In the floor directly in front of that altar are set ten stones from the Chapel of Moses on Mount Sinai, representing the Ten Commandments as a foundation for the Jerusalem Altar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many other works of art including over two hundred stained glass windows,[3] the most familiar of which may be the Space Window, honoring mankind's landing on the Moon, which includes a fragment of lunar rock at its center;[3] the rock was presented at the dedication service on July 21, 1974, the fifth anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission.[38] Extensive wrought iron adorns the building, much of it the work of Samuel Yellin. A substantial gate of forged iron by Albert Paley was installed on the north side of the crypt level in 2008. Intricate woodcarving, wall-sized murals and mosaics, and monumental cast bronze gates can also be found. Most of the interior decorative elements have Christian symbolism, in reference to the church's Episcopal roots, but the cathedral is filled with memorials to persons or events of national significance: statues of Washington and Lincoln, state seals embedded in the marble floor of the narthex, state flags that hang along the nave, stained glass commemorating events like the Lewis and Clark expedition and the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cathedral was built with several intentional \\"flaws\\" in keeping with an apocryphal medieval custom that sought to illustrate that only God can be perfect.[dubious  ÿ discuss] Artistically speaking, these flaws (which often come in the form of intentional asymmetries) draw the observer's focus to the sacred geometry as well as compensate for visual distortions, a practice that has been used since the Pyramids and the Parthenon.[citation needed] Architecturally, it is thought that if the main aisle of the cathedral where it meets the cross section were not tilted slightly off its axis, a person who looked straight down the aisle could experience a slight visual distortion, making the building seem shorter than it is, much like looking down railroad tracks.[citation needed] The architects designed the crypt chapels in Norman, Romanesque, and Transitional styles predating the Gothic, as though the cathedral had been built as a successor to earlier churches, a common occurrence in European cathedrals.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous grotesques and gargoyles adorn the exterior, most of them designed by the carvers; one of the more famous of these is a caricature of then-master carver Roger Morigi on the north exterior of the nave. There were also two competitions held for the public to provide designs to supplement those of the carvers. The second of these produced the famous Darth Vader Grotesque which is high on the northwest tower, sculpted by Jay Hall Carpenter and carved by Patrick J. Plunkett.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe west facade follows an iconographic program of the creation of the world rather than that of the Last Judgement as was traditional in medieval churches. All of the sculptural work was designed by Frederick Hart and features tympanum carvings of the creation of the sun and moon over the outer doors and the creation of man over the center. Hart also sculpted the three statues of Adam and Saints Peter and Paul. The west doors are cast bronze rather than wrought iron. The west rose window, often used as a trademark of the cathedral, was designed by Rowan leCompte and is an abstract depiction of the creation of light. LeCompte, who also designed the clerestory windows and the mosaics in the Resurrection Chapel, chose a nonrepresentational design because he feared that a figural window could fail to be seen adequately from the great distance to the nave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cathedral contains a basement, which was intentionally flooded during the Cuban missile crisis to provide emergency drinking water in the event of a nuclear war.[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cathedral's master plan was designed by George Frederick Bodley (founder of Watts & Co.), a highly regarded British Gothic Revival architect of the late-19th and early-20th centuries, and was influenced by Canterbury. Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. contributed a landscaping plan for the cathedral close and Nellie B. Allen designed a knot garden for the Bishop's Garden. After Bodley died in 1907, his partner Henry Vaughan revised the original design, but work stopped during World War I and Vaughan died in 1917. When work resumed, the chapter hired New York architecture firm Frohman, Robb and Little to execute the building. Philip Hubert Frohman, who had designed his first fully functional home at the age of 14 and received his architectural degree at the age of 16, and his partners worked to perfect Bodley's vision, adding the carillon section of the central tower, enlarging the west fa?ade, and making numerous smaller changes. Ralph Adams Cram was hired to supervise Frohman, because of his experience with the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, but Cram insisted on so many major changes to the original design that Frohman convinced the Cathedral Chapter to fire him. By Frohman's death in 1972, the final plans had been completed and the building was finished accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nDonation Thanks Engraving\\r\\n\\r\\nVaulting in northwest cloister\\r\\n\\r\\nPilgrim Observation Gallery\\r\\n\\r\\nFlying buttresses\\r\\n\\r\\nSide view of The Washington National Cathedral, with earthquake construction\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a placard for every state from the United States\\r\\n\\r\\nStatue of George Washington (by Lee Lawrie)\\r\\n\\r\\nStained-glass window\\r\\n\\r\\nGITMO stone inscribed in 1964 as a gift to the Cathedral from those at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base\\r\\n\\r\\nMount Sinai stone\\r\\n\\r\\nWomen's porch\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth transept tympanum\\r\\n\\r\\nDetail of figures flanking south doors\\r\\n\\r\\nDetail of the Moses window, by Lawrence Saint\\r\\n\\r\\nEncaustic mural of the burial of Jesus in the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea\\r\\n\\r\\nStained glass window depicting major events of the life of Confederate General Robert E.

Budde was elected by the Diocese of Washington in June 2011, to replace Bishop John Bryson Chane; upon her confirmation in November 2011 she became the ninth bishop of the diocese and the first woman to fill the role.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe National Cathedral Association (NCA) seeks to raise and provide funds for and promote the Washington National Cathedral. Across the United States, it has more than 14,000 members, more than 88 percent of whom live outside the Washington area, and who are divided into committees by state. Visitors to the cathedral provide another significant source of funds, through donations and group touring fees. Every year, each state has a state day at the cathedral, on which that state is recognized by name in the prayers. Over a span of about four years, each state is further recognized at a Major State Day, at which time those who live in the state are encouraged to make a pilgrimage to the cathedral and dignitaries from the state are invited to speak. American state flags were displayed in the nave until 2007; currently the display of the state flags alternates throughout the year with the display of liturgical banners hung on the pillars, reflecting the seasons of the Church year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe budget, $27 million in 2008, was trimmed to $13 million in 2010. Staff was reduced from 170 to 70. There was an endowment of $50 million.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2016, Randolph Marshall Hollerith was named as the next Dean of the Cathedral.[42][43] Hollerith comes to the National Cathedral from St. James Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia), where he was rector from 2000ÿ2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormer deans:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worship department is, like the cathedral itself, rooted in the doctrine and practice of the Episcopal Church, and based in the Book of Common Prayer. Three services are held each weekday, including the daily Eucharist. Sunday through Thursday, the Cathedral Choirs sing Evensong. The forty-minute service is attended by roughly fifty to seventy-five people, with more on Sunday. Three services of the Eucharist are held on Sunday, along with Choral Evensong.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cathedral also has been a temporary home to several congregations, including a Jewish synagogue and an Eastern Orthodox community. It has also been the site for several ecumenical and interfaith services. In October 2005, at the cathedral, the Rev. Nancy Wilson was consecrated and installed as Moderator (Denominational Executive) of the Metropolitan Community Church, by its founding Moderator, the Rev. Dr. Troy Perry.\\r\\n\\r\\nEach Christmas, the cathedral holds special services, which are broadcast to the world. The service of lessons and carols is distributed by Public Radio International. Christmas at Washington National Cathedral is a live television broadcast of the 9 a.m. Eucharist on Christmas Day. It is produced by WJLA-TV and is shown on national affiliates in most cities around the United States. Some affiliates broadcast the service at noon. The Christmas service at the Cathedral was broadcast to the nation on television from 1953 until 2010 and is still webcast live from the Cathedral's homepage.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Washington National Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys, founded in 1909, is one of very few cathedral choirs of men and boys in the United States with an affiliated school, in the English choir tradition. The 18ÿ22 boys singing treble are of ages 8ÿ14 and attend St. Albans School, the Cathedral school for boys, on vocal scholarships.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1997, the Cathedral Choir of Men and Girls was formed by Bruce Neswick, using the same men as the choir of the men and boys. The Choir consists of middle and high school girls attending the National Cathedral School on vocal scholarships. The two choirs currently share service duties and occasionally collaborate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth choirs have recently recorded several CDs, including a Christmas album; a U.S. premiere recording of St?le Kleiberg's Requiem for the Victims of Nazi Persecution; and a patriotic album, America the Beautiful.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choirs rehearse separately every weekday morning in a graded class incorporated into their school schedule. The choristers sing Evensong five days a week (the Boys Choir on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the Girls Choir on Mondays and Wednesdays). The choirs alternate Sunday worship duties, singing both morning Eucharist and afternoon Evensong when they are on call. The choirs also sing for numerous state and national events. The choirs are also featured annually on Christmas at Washington National Cathedral, broadcast nationally on Christmas Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Organ was installed by the Ernest M.

(Assamese: ??????, Assamese pronunciation:?[mazuli])[1] is a river island in the Brahmaputra River, Assam, India and the 1st island district of the country.[2] The island had a total area of 1,250 square kilometres (483?sq?mi) at the beginning of the 20th century,[3] but having lost significantly to erosion it had an area of only 352 square kilometres (136?sq?mi) in 2014.[4] Majuli has shrunk as the river surrounding it has grown.[5] However it is recognised by Guinness Book of World Records as World's Largest River Island.[6]\\r\\nThe island is formed by the Brahmaputra river in the south and the Kherkutia Xuti, an anabranch of the Brahmaputra, joined by the Subansiri River in the north. Mjuli island is accessible by ferries from the city of Jorhat. The island is about 300ÿ400 kilometres (186ÿ249?mi) east from the state's largest city Guwahati. It was formed due to course changes by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries, mainly the Lohit. Mjuli is the abode of the Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally, the island was a long, narrow piece of land called Majoli (land in the middle of two parallel rivers) that had the Brahmaputra flowing in the north and the Burhidihing flowing in the south, till they met at Lakhu. Frequent earthquakes in the period 1661ÿ1696 set the stage for a catastrophic flood in 1750 that continued for 15 days, which is mentioned in historical texts and reflected in folklore. As a result of this flood, the Brahmaputra split into two branches  one flowing along the original channel and the other flowing along the Burhidihing channel and the Mjuli island was formed.\\r\\nThe Burhidihing's point of confluence moved 190?km east and the southern channel which was the Burhidihing became the Burhi Xuti. The northern channel, which was previously the Brahmaputra, became the Luit Xuti. In due course, the flow in the Luit Xuti decreased, and it came to be known as the Kherkutia Xuti; and the Burhi Xuti expanded via erosion to become the main Brahmaputra River.\\r\\nThe locals speak in the Assamese, Mising languages mainly.Few of them speak in the Deori language as well.\\r\\nReference regarding the early existence of Majuli is found in Yogini Tranta that Chutiya king Ratnadhajpal founded his capital in Ratanpur. which is now in the east from kamalabari.[8] It was known as Ratnapur at that time.\\r\\nMjuli has been the cultural capital of Assamese civilisation since the 16th century; based on written records describing the visit of Srimanta Sankardeva  a 16th-century social reformer. Sankardeva, a pioneer of the medieval-age neo-Vaishnavite movement, preached a monotheist form of Hinduism called Vaishnavism and established monasteries and hermitages known as satra on the islet.\\r\\nThe island soon became the leading center of Vaishavinism with the establishment of these satras. After the arrival of the British, Majuli was under the rule of the British until India gained independence in 1947. It is one of world's biggest river islands.\\r\\nThe main industry is agriculture, with paddy being the chief crop. Mjuli has a rich and diverse agricultural tradition, with as many as 100 varieties of rice grown, all without pesticides or artificial fertilisers.[citation needed] Fishing is also among the main industry after agriculture. Among the fascinating arrays of rice produced are the Komal Saul, a unique type that can be eaten after immersing the grains in warm water for 15 minutes and usually eaten as a breakfast cereal; the bao dhan, that grows under water and is harvested after ten months; and the Bora saul, a sticky brown rice used to make the traditional cake with fish is known as pitha. Fishing, dairying, pottery, handloom and boat-making are other important economic activities.[9]\\r\\nHandloom is a major occupation among the distaff population of the villages. Although largely a non-commercial occupation, it keeps many of the inhabitants occupied. Weaving is exquisite and intricate with the use of a variety of colours and textures of cotton and silk, especially Muga silk. On November 4, 2017, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal launched 647 schemes with a total financial outlay of Rs. 24.57 crore to boost Majulis development.\\r\\nThe population of Majuli comprises of the tribals, non-tribals and the scheduled castes.The tribal communities include the Misings, the Deoris and the Sonowal Kacharis.The scheduled castes include the Kaivartas, the Brittial Banias etc.The non-tribal communities includes Koch, Kalitas, Ahoms, Chutiyas, Keot, Yogis etc.The Mising community has the largest population in the island who immigrated from Arunachal Pradesh to Majuli centuries ago . Languages spoken are Mising, Assamese, and Deori. The island has 144 villages with a population of over 150,000 and a density of 300 individuals per square km.\\r\\nFerry service which operates six times a day connects Majuli to Jorhat city. Night super buses ply between Guwahti to Majuli via Lakhimpur. Despite inherent drawbacks faced, modernism has touched this island, with the setting up of medical centers and educational institutions. Housing, too, has segued from traditional bamboo and mud construction to ones made of concrete.\\r\\nThe heart of all villages is the Namghar, where villagers episodically gather to sing and pray and to perform religious drama. It is the most important public place for the villagers. After the rituals are complete, villagers decide on issues concerning the village such as auctioning of fishing rights, what to do with money raised, and other topics of significance to the community as a whole.\\r\\nThe inhabitants are expert navigators by boat; their expertise is most visible during the monsoon season when they navigate the turbulent waters of the Brahmaputra.\\r\\nThe festival of Ali aye ligang is celebrated during mid-February with great pomp and show. It is celebrated for five days starting from second Wednesday of February till the next week. Local dishes like purang apin (rice wrapped in special leaves), apong (rice beer) and dishes made of pork, fish and chickens are served. Traditional Mising dance Gumrag Soman is performed in every village worshiping the almighty Donyi polo (mother sun and father moon) asking for good year of harvest.\\r\\nOther festivals like Christmas is celebrated by the majority Christians of Mising tribe in upper Majuli where Jengraimukh village is the epicentre of Christians. Majuli has been the cultural capital and the cradle of Assamese civilization for the past 500 years. The satras set up preserve antiques like weapons, utensils, jewellery and other items of cultural significance. Pottery is made in Mjuli from beaten clay and burnt in driftwood fired kilns in the same mode carried out by the peoples of the ancient Harrappan Civilisation. Sociologists have stressed the preservation of these unique peoples, whose culture and dance forms are untouched by modernism. The hand-loom work of these tribes is internationally famous.\\r\\nVirtually every person on the island is involved in the three-day long raas festival, depicting the life of Krishna. People from hundreds of kilometers away come to celebrate this festival including a number of expatriate members of community. The satras have honed certain art and craft traditions, which can now be found only here. In Natun Samuguri Satra for example, one can still find the craft of mask-making; and in the Kamalabari Satra the finest boats are made.\\r\\nThe island has been the hub of Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture, initiated around 15th century by the revered Assamese saint Srimanta Sankardeva and his disciple Madhavdeva. Many Satras or monasteries constructed by the saint still survive and represent the colourful Assamese culture. The saint took refuge in Mjuli and spent a couple of months at Beloguri in West Mjuli, which was a place of grandeur for the historic and auspicious, 'Manikanchan Sanjog' between Shankardeva and Madhavdeva, this was the first satra in Mjuli. After the \\"Manikanchan Sanjog\\", sixty five satras were set up. However, today only twenty-two of the original sixty-five are operational. Sixty-five out of the six hundred and sixty-five original satras in Assam were situated in Mjuli.

Among the birds seen here are the greater adjutant stork, pelican, Siberian crane and the whistling teal. After dark wild geese and ducks fly in flocks to distant destinations. The island is almost pollution free owing to the lack of polluting industries and factories and also the chronic rainfall.\\r\\nThe island is under threat due to the extensive soil erosion on its banks. The reason for this magnitude in erosion is the large embankments built in neighbouring towns upriver to prevent erosion during the monsoon season when the river distends its banks. The upshot is a backlash of the tempestuous Brahmaputra's fury on the islet, eroding most of the area. According to reports, in 1853, the total area of Mjuli was 1,150?km2 and about 33% of this landmass has been eroded in the latter half of 20th century. Since 1991, over 35 villages have been washed away. Surveys show that in 15ÿ20 years from now, Mjuli would cease to exist.\\r\\nTo save the island, the Union Government of India has sanctioned ? 250 crores (US $55 million) for the protection of the island. The water resource department & The Brahmaputra Board are struggling to solve the erosion problem of this island for the last three decade but without much success. Recently it was suggested that a four-lane highway protected by concrete mat along the southern boundary of Majuli and excavation of river bed of the Brahmaputra River, only can solve the problem. The project also includes two flood gates for the Kherkatia suti which is a tributary of the Brahmaputra. The Brahmaputra River Restoration Project is yet to be implemented by the government. However, a nomination has been sent to the UNESCO for the declaration of Mjuli to be as a world heritage site.[10]\\r\\nLocal environmental activist Jadav Payeng has planted a 550 hectare forest, known as Molai Forest to combat erosion on the island. Much of the island was barren sandbars that were vulnerable to erosion, but thanks to Payeng's afforestation, has become a lush forest. The forest has become habitat for animals including elephants, tigers, deer, and vultures.[11]\\r\\nMjuli is 20?km from Jorhat. One can take the bus or a hired taxi to the Nimati Steamer Ghat from where ferry services ply. The distance takes over three hours to cover, with three bus rides and two ferry rides.\\r\\nOn the north bank is the river Subansiri and on the south bank, the mighty Brahmaputra has excided the island from the main land. Lakhimpur town is to the north and Golaghat is to its southwest. The town of Sibsagar is on the southeast and Jorhat is to the south. On the extreme east is Dibrugarh District.\\r\\nThe southern part of the island is a bird lover's paradise. The best time to visit is between November to March as the weather and wildlife view is satisfactory.

It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The asteroid belt is also termed the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System such as near-Earth asteroids and trojan asteroids.[1] About half the mass of the belt is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea.[1] The total mass of the asteroid belt is approximately 4% that of the Moon, or 22% that of Pluto, and roughly twice that of Pluto's moon Charon (whose diameter is 1200?km).\\r\\nCeres, the asteroid belt's only dwarf planet, is about 950?km in diameter, whereas 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea have mean diameters of less than 600?km.[2][3][4][5] The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous unmanned spacecraft have traversed it without incident.[6] Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids do occur, and these can produce an asteroid family whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the asteroid belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type).\\r\\nThe asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals.[7] Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet.[7][8] Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history.[9] Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.[10]\\r\\nClasses of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects.\\r\\nOn 22 January 2014, ESA scientists reported the detection, for the first definitive time, of water vapor on Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt.[11] The detection was made by using the far-infrared abilities of the Herschel Space Observatory.[12] The finding was unexpected because comets, not asteroids, are typically considered to \\"sprout jets and plumes\\". According to one of the scientists, \\"The lines are becoming more and more blurred between comets and asteroids.\\"[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1596, Johannes Kepler predicted Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet in his Mysterium Cosmographicum.[13] While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler thought that there was too large a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.[14]\\r\\nIn an anonymous footnote to his 1766 translation of Charles Bonnet's Contemplation de la Nature,[15] the astronomer Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg[16][17] noted an apparent pattern in the layout of the planets. If one began a numerical sequence at 0, then included 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, etc., doubling each time, and added four to each number and divided by 10, this produced a remarkably close approximation to the radii of the orbits of the known planets as measured in astronomical units provided one allowed for a \\"missing planet\\" (equivalent to 24 in the sequence) between the orbits of Mars (12) and Jupiter (48). In his footnote, Titius declared \\"But should the Lord Architect have left that space empty? Not at all.\\"[16]\\r\\nWhen William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781, the planet's orbit matched the law almost perfectly, leading astronomers to conclude that there had to be a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.\\r\\nOn January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi, chair of astronomy at the University of Palermo, Sicily, found a tiny moving object in an orbit with exactly the radius predicted by this pattern. He dubbed it \\"Ceres\\", after the Roman goddess of the harvest and patron of Sicily. Piazzi initially believed it to be a comet, but its lack of a coma suggested it was a planet.[18]\\r\\nThus, the aforementioned pattern, now known as the TitiusÿBode law, predicted the semi-major axes of all eight planets of the time (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Ceres, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus).\\r\\nFifteen months later, Heinrich Olbers discovered a second object in the same region, Pallas. Unlike the other known planets, Ceres and Pallas remained points of light even under the highest telescope magnifications instead of resolving into discs. Apart from their rapid movement, they appeared indistinguishable from stars.\\r\\nAccordingly, in 1802, William Herschel suggested they be placed into a separate category, named \\"asteroids\\", after the Greek asteroeides, meaning \\"star-like\\".[19][20] Upon completing a series of observations of Ceres and Pallas, he concluded,[21]\\r\\nNeither the appellation of planets nor that of comets, can with any propriety of language be given to these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if I take my name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself, however, the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.\\r\\nBy 1807, further investigation revealed two new objects in the region: Juno and Vesta.[22] The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where the main body of work had been done,[23] brought this first period of discovery to a close.[22]\\r\\nDespite Herschel's coinage, for several decades it remained common practice to refer to these objects as planets[15] and to prefix their names with numbers representing their date of discovery: 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, 4 Vesta. However, in 1845 astronomers detected a fifth object (5 Astraea) and, shortly thereafter, new objects were found at an accelerating rate. Counting them among the planets became increasingly cumbersome. Eventually, they were dropped from the planet list (as first suggested by Alexander von Humboldt in the early 1850s) and Herschel's choice of nomenclature, \\"asteroids\\", gradually came into common use.[15]\\r\\nThe discovery of Neptune in 1846 led to the discrediting of the TitiusÿBode law in the eyes of scientists because its orbit was nowhere near the predicted position. To date, there is no scientific explanation for the law, and astronomers' consensus regards it as a coincidence.[24]\\r\\nThe expression \\"asteroid belt\\" came into use in the very early 1850s, although it is hard to pinpoint who coined the term. The first English use seems to be in the 1850 translation (by E. C. Ott) of Alexander von Humboldt's Cosmos:[25] \\"[...] and the regular appearance, about the 13th of November and the 11th of August, of shooting stars, which probably form part of a belt of asteroids intersecting the Earth's orbit and moving with planetary velocity\\". Another early appearance occurred in Robert James Mann's A Guide to the Knowledge of the Heavens:[26] \\"The orbits of the asteroids are placed in a wide belt of space, extending between the extremes of [...]\\". The American astronomer Benjamin Peirce seems to have adopted that terminology and to have been one of its promoters.[27]\\r\\nOne hundred asteroids had been located by mid-1868, and in 1891 the introduction of astrophotography by Max Wolf accelerated the rate of discovery still further.[28] A total of 1,000 asteroids had been found by 1921,[29] 10,000 by 1981,[30] and 100,000 by 2000.[31] Modern asteroid survey systems now use automated means to locate new minor planets in ever-increasing quantities.\\r\\nIn 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the MarsÿJupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before.[32] Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon,[2] do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet.[33] Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.\\r\\nIn general, in the Solar System, a planetary formation is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis: a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then further condensed to form the Sun and planets.[34] During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets.\\r\\nPlanetesimals within the region which would become the asteroid belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding.[35] In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion,[36] preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.[37]\\r\\nDuring the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5?billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation.[38] In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.[39]\\r\\nThe asteroids are not samples of the primordial Solar System. They have undergone considerable evolution since their formation, including internal heating (in the first few tens of millions of years), surface melting from impacts, space weathering from radiation, and bombardment by micrometeorites.[40] Although some scientists refer to the asteroids as residual planetesimals,[41] other scientists consider them distinct.[42]\\r\\nThe current asteroid belt is believed to contain only a small fraction of the mass of the primordial belt. Computer simulations suggest that the original asteroid belt may have contained the mass equivalent to the Earth.[43] Primarily because of gravitational perturbations, most of the material was ejected from the belt within about a million years of formation, leaving behind less than 0.1% of the original mass.[35] Since their formation, the size distribution of the asteroid belt has remained relatively stable: there has been no significant increase or decrease in the typical dimensions of the main-belt asteroids.[44]\\r\\nThe 4:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06?AU, can be considered the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. Perturbations by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits. Most bodies formed within the radius of this gap were swept up by Mars (which has an aphelion at 1.67?AU) or ejected by its gravitational perturbations in the early history of the Solar System.[45] The Hungaria asteroids lie closer to the Sun than the 4:1 resonance, but are protected from disruption by their high inclination.[46]\\r\\nWhen the asteroid belt was first formed, the temperatures at a distance of 2.7?AU from the Sun formed a \\"snow line\\" below the freezing point of water. Planetesimals formed beyond this radius were able to accumulate ice.[47][48] In 2006 it was announced that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient outgassing of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.[49]\\r\\nContrary to popular imagery, the asteroid belt is mostly empty. The asteroids are spread over such a large volume that it would be improbable to reach an asteroid without aiming carefully. Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100?km,[50] and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that the asteroid belt has 0.7ÿ1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1?km or more.[51] The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11ÿ19, with the median at about 16.[52]\\r\\nThe total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 2.8G1021 to 3.2G1021 kilograms, which is just 4% of the mass of the Moon.[3] The four largest objects, Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, and 10 Hygiea, account for half of the belt's total mass, with almost one-third accounted for by Ceres alone.[4][5]\\r\\nThe current belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type or carbonaceous asteroids, S-type or silicate asteroids, and M-type or metallic asteroids.\\r\\nCarbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions.[53] Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.\\r\\nS-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun.[53][54] The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.\\r\\nM-type (metal-rich) asteroids form about 10% of the total population; their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel. Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, there are also some silicate compounds that can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope does not appear to be primarily composed of metal.[55] Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semi-major axis of about 2.7?AU.[56] It is not yet clear whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes.[57]\\r\\nOne mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V-type or basaltic asteroids.[59] Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock, resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine. Observations, however, suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing.[60] Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type). However, the discovery of the asteroid 1459 Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then, suggesting a different origin.[60] This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt, 7472 Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta. These latter two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date.[59]\\r\\nThe temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200?K (?73?C) at 2.2?AU down to 165?K (?108?C) at 3.2?AU[61] However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.\\r\\nSeveral otherwise unremarkable bodies in the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through the capture of classical comets, it is thought that many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans because the deuterium-hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.[62]\\r\\nMost asteroids within the asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4.[52] Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near the plane of the ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.\\r\\nSometimes, the term main belt is used to refer only to the more compact \\"core\\" region where the greatest concentration of bodies is found. This lies between the strong 4:1 and 2:1 Kirkwood gaps at 2.06 and 3.27 AU, and at orbital eccentricities less than roughly 0.33, along with orbital inclinations below about 20. As of 2006[update], this \\"core\\" region contained 93% of all discovered and numbered minor planets within the Solar System.[63] The JPL Small-Body Database lists 670000+ known main belt asteroids.[64]\\r\\nThe semi-major axis of an asteroid is used to describe the dimensions of its orbit around the Sun, and its value determines the minor planet's orbital period. In 1866, Daniel Kirkwood announced the discovery of gaps in the distances of these bodies' orbits from the Sun. They were located in positions where their period of revolution about the Sun was an integer fraction of Jupiter's orbital period. Kirkwood proposed that the gravitational perturbations of the planet led to the removal of asteroids from these orbits.[65]\\r\\nWhen the mean orbital period of an asteroid is an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, a mean-motion resonance with the gas giant is created that is sufficient to perturb an asteroid to new orbital elements. Asteroids that become located in the gap orbits (either primordially because of the migration of Jupiter's orbit,[66] or due to prior perturbations or collisions) are gradually nudged into different, random orbits with a larger or smaller semi-major axis.\\r\\nThe gaps are not seen in a simple snapshot of the locations of the asteroids at any one time because asteroid orbits are elliptical, and many asteroids still cross through the radii corresponding to the gaps. The actual spatial density of asteroids in these gaps does not differ significantly from the neighboring regions.[67]\\r\\nThe main gaps occur at the 3:1, 5:2, 7:3, and 2:1 mean-motion resonances with Jupiter. An asteroid in the 3:1 Kirkwood gap would orbit the Sun three times for each Jovian orbit, for instance. Weaker resonances occur at other semi-major axis values, with fewer asteroids found than nearby. (For example, an 8:3 resonance for asteroids with a semi-major axis of 2.71 AU.)[68]\\r\\nThe main or core population of the asteroid belt is sometimes divided into three zones, based on the most prominent Kirkwood gaps:\\r\\nThe asteroid belt may also be divided into the inner and outer belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5?AU), and the outer belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and outer belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, and outer belts; also see diagram).\\r\\nThe high population of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10?km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years.[70] A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading to the formation of a new asteroid family).[71] Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear little resemblance to the original population.\\r\\nAlong with the asteroid bodies, the asteroid belt also contains bands of dust with particle radii of up to a few hundred micrometres. This fine material is produced, at least in part, from collisions between asteroids, and by the impact of micrometeorites upon the asteroids. Due to the PoyntingÿRobertson effect, the pressure of solar radiation causes this dust to slowly spiral inward toward the Sun.[72]\\r\\nThe combination of this fine asteroid dust, as well as ejected cometary material, produces the zodiacal light. This faint auroral glow can be viewed at night extending from the direction of the Sun along the plane of the ecliptic. Asteroid particles that produce the visible zodiacal light average about 40?m in radius. The typical lifetimes of main-belt zodiacal cloud particles are about 700,000?years. Thus, to maintain the bands of dust, new particles must be steadily produced within the asteroid belt.[72] It was once thought that collisions of asteroids form a major component of the zodiacal light. However, computer simulations by Nesvorny and colleagues attributed 85 percent of the zodiacal-light dust to fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets, rather than to comets and collisions between asteroids in the asteroid belt. At most 10 percent of the dust is attributed to the asteroid belt.[73]\\r\\nSome of the debris from collisions can form meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere.[74] Of the 50,000 meteorites found on Earth to date, 99.8 percent are believed to have originated in the asteroid belt.[75]\\r\\nIn 1918, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama noticed that the orbits of some of the asteroids had similar parameters, forming families or groups.[76]\\r\\nApproximately one-third of the asteroids in the asteroid belt are members of an asteroid family. These share similar orbital elements, such as semi-major axis, eccentricity, and orbital inclination as well as similar spectral features, all of which indicate a common origin in the breakup of a larger body. Graphical displays of these elements, for members of the asteroid belt, show concentrations indicating the presence of an asteroid family. There are about 20ÿ30 associations that are almost certainly asteroid families. Additional groupings have been found that are less certain. Asteroid families can be confirmed when the members display common spectral features.[77] Smaller associations of asteroids are called groups or clusters.\\r\\nSome of the most prominent families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunoma, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families.[56] The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than a billion years ago.[78] The largest asteroid to be a true member of a family (as opposed to an interloper in the case of Ceres with the Gefion family) is 4 Vesta. The Vesta family is believed to have formed as the result of a crater-forming impact on Vesta. Likewise, the HED meteorites may also have originated from Vesta as a result of this collision.[79]\\r\\nThree prominent bands of dust have been found within the asteroid belt. These have similar orbital inclinations as the Eos, Koronis, and Themis asteroid families, and so are possibly associated with those groupings.[80]\\r\\nThe main belt evolution after the Late Heavy Bombardment was very likely affected by the passages of large Centaurs and Trans-Neptunian Objecs (TNOs). Centaurs and TNOs that reach the inner Solar System can modify the orbits of main belt asteroids, though only if their mass is of the order of 10?9 m for single encounters or, one order less in case of multiple close encounters. However Centaurs and TNOs are unlikely to have significantly dispersed young asteroid families in the main belt, but they can have perturbed some old asteroid families. Current main belt asteroids that originated as Centaurs or Trans-Neptunian Objects may lie in the outer belt with short lifetimeP4?My, \\\\ most likely between 2.8?AU and 3.2?AU at larger eccentricities than typical of main belt asteroid.[81]\\r\\nSkirting the inner edge of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9?AU) is the Hungaria family of minor planets. They are named after the main member, 434 Hungaria; the group contains at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing the total population of this group.[82]\\r\\nAnother high-inclination group in the inner part of the asteroid belt is the Phocaea family. These are composed primarily of S-type asteroids, whereas the neighboring Hungaria family includes some E-types.[83] The Phocaea family orbit between 2.25 and 2.5 AU from the Sun.\\r\\nSkirting the outer edge of the asteroid belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5?AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2?AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2?AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1?km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.[84]\\r\\nSome asteroid families have formed recently, in astronomical terms. The Karin Cluster apparently formed about 5.7 million years ago from a collision with a progenitor asteroid 33?km in radius.[85] The Veritas family formed about 8.3 million years ago; evidence includes interplanetary dust recovered from ocean sediment.[86]\\r\\nMore recently, the Datura cluster appears to have formed about 530 thousand years ago from a collision with a main-belt asteroid. The age estimate is based on the probability of the members having their current orbits, rather than from any physical evidence. However, this cluster may have been a source for some zodiacal dust material.[87][88] Other recent cluster formations, such as the Iannini cluster (circa 1ÿ5 million years ago), may have provided additional sources of this asteroid dust.[89]\\r\\nThe first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 ?teins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015.[90] On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data.[91] Due to the low density of materials within the belt, the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.[92]\\r\\nMost belt asteroids imaged to date have come from brief flyby opportunities by probes headed for other targets. Only the Dawn, NEAR and Hayabusa missions have studied asteroids for a protracted period in orbit and at the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSolar System?L Local Interstellar Cloud?L Local Bubble?L Gould Belt?L Orion Arm?L Milky Way?L Milky Way subgroup?L Local Group?L Virgo Supercluster?L Laniakea Supercluster?L Observable universe?L Universe\\r\\nEach arrow (L) may be read as \\"within\\" or \\"part of\\".","input":"What is the region between mars and jupiter called?"},{"output":"a multi-span balanced cantilever bridge with a post-tensioned concrete box girder structure","context":"C$46.50 two-axle automobile\\r\\n$8.50 per extra axle\\r\\n$18.50 motorcycle\\r\\n$8.75 bicycle (transported by shuttle vehicle)\\r\\n$4.25 pedestrian (transported by shuttle vehicle)\\r\\nThe Confederation Bridge (French: Pont de la Confdration) spans the Abegweit Passage of Northumberland Strait. It links Prince Edward Island with mainland New Brunswick, Canada. Before its official naming, Prince Edward Islanders often referred to the bridge as the \\"Fixed Link\\". Construction took place from October 1993 to May 1997[2] and cost C$1.3 billion. The 12.9-kilometre (8?mi) bridge opened on May 31, 1997.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bridge is a two-lane toll bridge that carries the Trans-Canada Highway between Borden-Carleton, Prince Edward Island (at Route 1) and Cape Jourimain, New Brunswick (at Route 16).\\r\\nIt is a multi-span balanced cantilever bridge with a post-tensioned concrete box girder structure. Most of the curved bridge is 40 metres (131?ft) above water with a 60?m (197?ft) navigation span for ship traffic. The bridge rests on 62 piers, of which the 44 main piers are 250?m (820?ft) apart. The bridge is 11?m (36?ft) wide.\\r\\nThe speed limit on the bridge is 80 kilometres per hour (50?mph) but can vary with wind and weather conditions. When travelling at the speed limit, it takes about 12 minutes to cross the bridge.\\r\\nTolls only apply when leaving Prince Edward Island (when traveling westbound). The toll rates as of January 2017[ref] are $46.50 for a two-axle automobile and $8.00 for each additional axle. Motorcycles are charged $18.50.\\r\\nWhile pedestrians and cyclists are not permitted to cross the bridge, a shuttle service is available. Before 2006, the shuttle was free but since January 1, 2015, the service has charged $4.25 per pedestrian or $8.75 per cyclist when leaving Prince Edward Island.\\r\\nThe other major Northumberland Strait crossing, Wood Islands Ferry from Wood Islands, Prince Edward Island to Caribou, Nova Scotia, currently[ref] charges $72.00 per car (including passengers)[ref] when leaving Prince Edward Island. Other ferry fares include $19.00 per adult pedestrian, $40.00 per motorcycle, and $20.00 per bicycle. Travellers, whether entering the island by bridge and leaving by ferry or vice versa only pay for leaving the island.\\r\\nVarious proposals for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait can be traced as far back as the 1870s when the province's railway system was developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The ebb and flow of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the current bridge being constructed.\\r\\nAs a part of Prince Edward Island's admission into the Dominion of Canada in 1873, the Canadian government was obligated to provide...\\r\\nFollowing Confederation, early steamship services across Northumberland Strait connected the Island ports of Charlottetown and Georgetown with railway facilities at Pictou, Nova Scotia. Similar services operated from Summerside connected with railway facilities at Shediac, New Brunswick.\\r\\nThe most direct route across the Northumberland Strait, however, was at the 13-kilometre (8.1?mi) wide Abegweit Passage. Infrequent winter service provided by underpowered steamships incapable of breaking sea ice ensured the survival of a passenger and mail service across Abegweit Passage using iceboats until a permanent ferry service was established in the 1910s.\\r\\nThe unsatisfactory winter steamship service and reliance upon primitive iceboats provoked complaints from the Island government until the federal government decided to implement a railcar ferry service across Abegweit Passage between new ports at Port Borden and Cape Tormentine.\\r\\nIn 1912, the federal government promised to open a car ferry between the \\"Capes\\" (Cape Traverse, PEI to Cape Tormentine, NB). The privately owned New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Railway from Sackville, New Brunswick to Cape Tormentine was purchased by the federal government and an order was made with a shipyard in England for an icebreaking railcar ferry, to be called the Prince Edward Island. Ports were developed at Carleton Point, several kilometres west of Cape Traverse, and the existing harbour at Cape Tormentine; the new port at Carleton Point would be named Borden in honour of Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden.\\r\\nThe new ferry entered service in 1915 and operated on the former steamship routes until port facilities were opened in October 1917. Automobile service was added in 1938 and other vessels followed as the ferry service expanded in the post-war years.\\r\\nThis ferry service was initially the responsibility of Canadian Government Railways (1917ÿ1918) and later Canadian National Railway (1918ÿ1983), then a CNR subsidiary CN Marine (1977ÿ1986). In 1986, CN Marine was renamed when all federal government ferry services in Atlantic Canada were transferred to the new Crown corporation Marine Atlantic.\\r\\nDiscussion of a fixed link can be traced to George Howlan, who called for construction of a railway tunnel beneath Abegweit Passage at the same time as the Prince Edward Island Railway was being built across the province in the 1870s. Howlan also raised the issue as a member of the provincial Legislative Assembly, and in March 1891, as a Senator and member of a delegation to meetings on the subject, conducted at the British Parliament. The idea lost favour following his death in 1901.\\r\\nTalk of a fixed link was revived in the 1950s and 1960s, coinciding with federal election campaigns. The topic was raised in 1957, only two years following the opening of the Canso Causeway, and at the same time as another mega-project, the St. Lawrence Seaway was being constructed. A rockfill causeway was proposed to cross Abegweit Passage, with a 300?m (984?ft) bridge/tunnel to accommodate shipping. This plan was rejected for navigational reasons but was raised again in 1962, and in 1965, the federal government, ignoring concerns of the shipping industry, called for tenders for a $148 million fixed link featuring a tunnel/causeway/bridge. Approach roads and railway lines were constructed at Borden and Jourimain Island but the project was formally abandoned in 1969 upon scientific recommendation in favour of improved ferry services.\\r\\nDue to the extremely complex tidal regime in the Northumberland Strait consisting of diurnal and semi-diurnal cycles, any attempt to close Abegweit Passage would be next to impossible since the tidal cycles on each side of a causeway would be placed at opposites to each other. It is estimated by tidal experts at the Canadian Hydrographic Service, that tidal currents through a gap in such a causeway would be in excess of 18 knots (33?km/h), powerful enough to counter most commercial ships and to sweep away boulders the size of houses.[5]\\r\\nConsideration of a fixed link was renewed in the 1980s by an unsolicited proposal from a Nova Scotia businessman. The federal government favoured the construction of a fixed link chiefly because of the rising costs of providing ferry service (a constitutional requirement dating from PEI's accession to Confederation) and the increasing deficits being incurred by the railway system on PEI (run as part of Canadian National, then a Crown corporation). The federal government proposed to provide a fixed subsidy for the construction and operation of a fixed link, in return for the province agreeing to the abandonment of the ferry service and the railway system.\\r\\nFollowing the election of the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, with its agenda for regional development through so-called \\"mega-projects,\\" Public Works Canada called for formal proposals in 1987 and received three offers. These proposals included a tunnel, a bridge, and a combined tunnel-causeway-bridge.\\r\\nThese developments sparked an extremely divisive debate on the Island, and Premier Joe Ghiz promised a plebiscite to gauge public support, which was held on January 18, 1988.\\r\\nDuring the plebiscite debate, the anti-link group Friends of the Island cited potential ecological damage from the construction, as well as concerns about the impact on Prince Edward Island's lifestyle in general, and noted that the \\"mega-project\\" model has had limited success in other areas of the world, and rarely enriched the local population. The Friends of the Island believed that a fixed link was being pressured by a federal government not willing to shoulder the cost of constitutional obligations for funding an efficient ferry service, and that a link would be built largely for the benefit of mainland tourists and businesses waiting to exploit the Island.\\r\\nThe pro-link group Islanders for a Better Tomorrow noted transportation reliability would result in improvements for exporters and the tourism industry.\\r\\nThe result was 59.4% (in total percentage) in favour of the fixed link.\\r\\nThe debate did not end with the 1988 plebiscite and the federal government faced numerous legal challenges and a lengthy environmental impact assessment for the project. The developer of the single bridge proposal, Strait Crossing Development Inc., was selected and an announcement that the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project would be built was finally made on December 2, 1992; the developer being required to privately finance all construction through bond markets.\\r\\nShareholders of Strait Crossing Development Inc. include:\\r\\nAs mentioned, the Schedule to the Prince Edward Island Terms of Union in the Constitution of Canada required steamship service to connect the Island's railway system with that of mainland North America. A dedicated ferry service replaced the steamships in 1917 but no changes were made to the constitution. The fixed crossing, however, required a constitutional amendment (see Amendments to the Constitution of Canada).\\r\\nThe Constitution Amendment Proclamation, 1993 (Prince Edward Island) dealt with this issue, as well as the issue of tolls on the crossing. It made clear that the government (or a private body) could charge a toll (an essential part of the government's financing plans) for the crossing without violating the terms of union:\\r\\nThe construction, which was carried out by a construction joint venture of Ballast Nedam, GTMI (Canada), Northern Construction and Strait Crossing Inc.,[6] started in the fall of 1993, beginning with preparation of staging facilities. Bridge components were built year-round from 1994 to the summer of 1996, and placement of components began in the fall of 1994 until the fall of 1996. Approach roads, toll plazas, and final work on the structure continued until the spring of 1997, at an estimated total cost of $1 billion.\\r\\nAll bridge components were constructed on land, in purpose-built staging yards located on the shoreline at Amherst Head, fronting on Borden Harbour just east of the town and ferry docks, and an inland facility located at Bayfield, New Brunswick about 3?km (1.9?mi) west of Cape Tormentine. The Amherst Head staging facility was where all large components were built, including the pier bases, ice shields, main spans, and drop-in spans. The Bayfield facility was used to construct components for the near-shore bridges which were linked using a launching truss extending over shallow waters almost 2?km (1.2?mi) from the New Brunswick shore, and .5?km (0.3?mi) from the Prince Edward Island shore.\\r\\nExtremely durable high-grade concrete and reinforcing steel were used throughout construction of the pre-cast components, with the estimated lifespan of the bridge being in excess of 100 years. Their sheer size and weight required strengthening of the soil base during the design and preparation work for the Amherst Head staging facility, as well as the use of a crawler transport system to move pieces from fabrication to storage, and onto a nearby pier. These crawler transports, using specially designed teflon-coated concrete rails, earned the nickname lobsters from workers.\\r\\nAll major components were lifted from the Amherst Head staging facility, transported, and placed in Abegweit Passage using the HLV Svanen, a Dutch-built heavy lift catamaran, which during the construction of the fixed link was reportedly the tallest man-made structure in the province. HLV Svanen was custom-built for use on the Great Belt Bridge in the early 1990s, Denmark's largest construction project, and was modified at a French shipyard before working on the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project. Following the placement of the final major component and completion of the bridge structure in Abegweit Passage on November 19, 1996, HLV Svanen returned to Denmark for use in construction of the ?resund Bridge.\\r\\nConstruction of the fixed link required over 5,000 workers ranging from labourers and specialty trades, to engineers, surveyors, and managers. The economic impact of construction on Prince Edward Island was substantial, with the provincial GDP rising over 5% during the construction, providing a short-term economic boom for the Island.\\r\\nIt neared completion in April 1997.[7]\\r\\nSince the Island-coined nickname \\"Fixed Link\\" was not considered appropriate,[discuss] and the federal government-coined project name \\"Northumberland Strait Crossing Project\\" was deemed awkward, there was a need for a formal name for the structure. Throughout construction, the federal government received suggestions for names and on September 27, 1996, the name \\"Confederation Bridge\\" was chosen.[citation needed]\\r\\nThis name is not without controversy as many Islanders feel the word \\"Confederation\\" is overused throughout the province, finding use in the name of a Northumberland Ferries Limited vessel (M/V Confederation), a performing arts centre and art gallery (Confederation Centre of the Arts), a shopping centre (Confederation Court Mall), and the province-wide rails to trails system (Confederation Trail), as well as in tourism promotions (e.g., \\"Birthplace of Confederation\\"). The preference of Islanders was reportedly to use the name \\"Abegweit Crossing\\" which would pay homage to the Abegweit Passage, the vessel M/V Abegweit which the bridge would replace, and to the Mi'kmaq traditional name for the province.[citation needed]\\r\\nHowever, at a time when national unity had just been challenged in the razor-thin results of the 1995 Quebec referendum, the federal government opted for a bilingually appropriate and nationally accepted, politically correct name for Canada's longest bridge connecting the mainland portion of the country to the province where the first meetings at the Charlottetown Conference in September 1864 led to the Confederation of British North America.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, during a state visit to Canada in 1998, referred to the bridge as the \\"Span of Green Gables\\".[8]\\r\\nAfter completing the structure on November 19, 1996, SCI worked throughout the winter, paving the bridge deck, placing protective walls which act as wind barriers, placing bridge deck and navigational lighting, constructing the Borden-Carleton toll plaza, and finishing the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island approach roads. In separate construction, the federal and provincial governments built a new commercial and tourist development on the abandoned CN rail yards in Borden-Carleton, with phase I of this facility opening in spring 1997 as \\"Gateway Village\\". New Brunswick has never received similar federal support to improve the economy of Cape Tormentine, which has become a shadow of its former role in PEI transportation history, although in recent years a new eco-tourist and visitor centre was opened on Jourimain Island near the western end of the bridge.\\r\\nThe official opening for the bridge took place on May 31, 1997, with the first traffic crossing at approximately 5:00?p.m. ADT following a nationally televised ceremony which aired on CBC and included a sailpast of the schooner Bluenose II and several Canadian Coast Guard ships, a flyover by the Snowbirds, and an emotional farewell to the beloved ferries which made their final crossings that evening. It is estimated that almost 75,000 people participated in a \\"Bridge Walk\\" and \\"Bridge Run\\" during the hours immediately prior to the opening for traffic.\\r\\nIn the days following the opening of the bridge, ferry operator Marine Atlantic disposed of its four vessels. The ferry terminals and docks in both ports were removed over the summer of 1997.\\r\\nThe bridge is operated by Strait Crossing Bridge Limited (SCBL), a subsidiary of the Strait Crossing Development Inc. consortium which built the structure. SCBL will privately manage, maintain, and operate the bridge until 2032, when these operations will transfer to the Government of Canada.\\r\\nThe Government of Canada agreed to pay about $44 million a year for 33 years to Strait Crossing Development Inc., this being the subsidy which was formerly paid to Marine Atlantic to cover operating losses of the ferry system. These payments are in effect a mortgage and are being used by the developer to pay off construction costs. In 2032, the bridge's ownership will revert to the federal government.\\r\\nAll tolls charged by SCBL are revenue for the consortium. Toll increases are indexed to inflation and regulated by the federal government. The consortium has rarely commented upon the profitability of the bridge, but during the structure's 10th anniversary, it was revealed that there had been a 30% cost overrun in construction ($330 million), The consortium is forced to cover this out of toll revenue since the federal government ferry subsidy is used to pay for the original tendered price ($1 billion). Operating costs for the bridge have also proven expensive, with warranty repairs for asphalt adherence and the complete replacement of all bridge deck lighting cutting into profits. Toll revenues have fallen over 30% since the bridge opened, largely because of declining tourism traffic and domestic travel and currently range from $25 to $30 million annually. After expenses in 2003, the consortium received a year-end dividend of $2.6 million.[9]\\r\\nThe number of tourists visiting Prince Edward Island increased from 740,000 in 1996 (the year before the bridge opened) to 1,200,000 in 1997,[10] but this dropped back to about 900,000 visitors annually. The number of visitors staying in overnight accommodations in the province actually fell below pre-1996 levels, as many visitors now tour Prince Edward Island in \\"day trips\\" out of Moncton or Halifax. Prince Edward Island has responded by building high-end attractions such as golf courses to encourage increased spending by tourists during their shorter stays.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe link has made a difference in the export of food from Prince Edward Island. Potato production has increased dramatically, with industrial farming techniques being used to meet the demand. An increased number of food processing plants, creating items such as french fries and potato chips, have also benefitted from access to the increased potato crop and the ease of transporting off the island. Time-critical seafood has also increased exports from Prince Edward Island since 1997.\\r\\nThere has been a revolution in the island's retail sector since the opening of the Confederation Bridge. Before 1997, big box stores were rare and mostly found in larger centres in the Maritimes such as Halifax, Moncton, or Saint John. Prince Edward Island had a larger number of smaller, family-owned retail stores than other provinces, with few shopping malls and less selection of consumer goods. The opening of the Confederation Bridge was viewed with concern by government and the retail sector alike, as many thought Islanders would use the quicker transportation connection to drive to Moncton for many large-item purchases. While there was a small increase in the number of off-Island shoppers, the provincial government established a program of encouraging big box retailers to establish in the province. This included the elimination of provincial sales tax on clothing and footwear, resulting in a plethora of chains such as Walmart, Sears, Future Shop, Staples, and The Home Depot building stores on the Island. However, many smaller locally owned stores have gone out of business. This is one of the more visible impacts since the opening of the Confederation Bridge.[citation needed]\\r\\nAs a way of further promoting the island's new accessibility, the province issued vehicle licence plates from 1997 to 2006 that featured a likeness of the Confederation Bridge between the serial number. With valid registration, these plates remain visible on the road today.[11]","input":"What type of bridge is the confederation bridge?"},{"output":"Stechford, Birmingham","context":"Aldi (stylised as ALDI) is the common brand of two discount supermarket chains with over 10,000 stores in 20 countries, and an estimated combined turnover of more than ?50 billion.[1][5][6] Based in Germany, the chain was founded by brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht in 1946 when they took over their mother's store in Essen, which had been in operation since 1913. The business was split into two separate groups in 1960, that later became Aldi Nord, headquartered in Essen, and Aldi Sd, headquartered in Mlheim.[7][8] In 1962, they introduced the name Aldi (a syllabic abbreviation for Albrecht Diskont),[9] which is pronounced [?aldi?]?(?listen). In Germany, Aldi Nord and Aldi Sd have been financially and legally separate since 1966, although both divisions' names may appear (as if they were a single enterprise) with certain store brands or when negotiating with contractor companies. The formal business name is Aldi Einkauf GmbH & Compagnie, oHG.\\r\\nAldi's German operations consist of Aldi Nord's 35 individual regional companies with about 2,500 stores in western, northern, and Eastern Germany, and Aldi Sd's 32 regional companies with 1,600 stores in western and southern Germany.[citation needed] Internationally, Aldi Nord operates in Denmark, France, the Benelux countries, Portugal, Spain and Poland, while Aldi Sd operates in Ireland, Great Britain, Hungary, Switzerland, Australia, China, Italy, Austria and Slovenia (Aldi Sd operates as Hofer within the latter two countries). Both Aldi Nord and Aldi Sd also operate in the United States with 1,600 stores as of 2017.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe earliest roots of the company trace back to 1913, when the mother of Karl and Theo Albrecht opened a small store in a suburb of Essen.[10] Their father was employed as a miner and later as a baker's assistant. Karl Albrecht was born in 1920, Theo Albrecht in 1922. Theo Albrecht completed an apprenticeship in his mother's store, while Karl Albrecht worked in a delicatessen.\\r\\nKarl Albrecht took over a food shop formerly run by F. W. Judt who already advertised that they were the \\"cheapest food source\\". Karl Albrecht served in the German Army during World War II. In 1946, the brothers took over their mother's business and soon opened another retail outlet nearby.[10] By 1950, the Albrecht brothers owned 13 stores in the Ruhr Valley.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe brothers' idea, which was new at the time, was to subtract the legal maximum rebate of 3% before sale. The market leaders at the time, which often were co-operatives, required their customers to collect rebate stamps, and to send them at regular intervals to reclaim their money. The Albrecht brothers also rigorously removed merchandise that did not sell from their shelves, cutting costs by neither advertising nor selling fresh produce, and keeping the size of their retail outlets small.[10]\\r\\nWhen the brothers split the company in 1960 over a dispute whether they should sell cigarettes,[11] they owned 300 shops with a cash flow of DM90 million yearly. In 1962, they introduced the name Aldishort for Albrecht-Diskont. Aldi Nord and Aldi Sd have been financially and legally separate since 1966, although both divisions' names may appear as if they were a single enterprise with certain store brands or when negotiating with contractor companies.\\r\\nThe individual groups were originally owned and managed jointly by the brothers. Karl Albrecht (d. 2014) retained ownership of Aldi Sd, and with a personal wealth of ?17.2 billion, making him the richest man in Germany, while the co-owners of Aldi Nord, Berthold and Theo Albrecht Jr., close behind at ?16 billion. Dieter Schwarz, owner of Lidl and Kaufland came in third, with a fortune of ?11.5 billion.[12]\\r\\nAldi started to expand internationally in 1967, when Aldi Sd acquired the grocery chain Hofer in Austria;[13] Aldi Nord opened its first stores abroad in the Netherlands in 1973,[14] and other countries followed. In 1976, Aldi opened its first store in the United States in Iowa,[a] and, in 1979, Aldi Nord acquired Trader Joes.[10] After German reunification and the fall of the Iron Curtain, Aldi experienced a rapid expansion. The brothers retired as CEOs in 1993; control of the companies was placed in the hands of private family foundations, the Siepmann Foundation (Aldi Sd) and the Markus Foundation (Aldi Nord, Trader Joe's).[6]\\r\\nThe Aldi Nord group currently consists of 35 independent regional branches with approximately 2,500 stores. Aldi Sd is made up of 31 companies with 1,600 stores. The border between their territories is commonly known as Aldi-?quator (literally: Aldi equator)[16][17] and runs from the Rhine via Mlheim an der Ruhr, Wermelskirchen, Marburg, Siegen, and Gie?en east to just north of Fulda.\\r\\nThe former East Germany is served by Aldi Nord, except for one Aldi Sd in Sonneberg, Thuringia, whose regional office is in Bavaria. The regional branches are organised as limited partnerships with a regional manager for each branch who reports directly to the head office in Essen (Aldi Nord) or Mlheim an der Ruhr (Aldi Sd).\\r\\nIn December 2002, a survey conducted by the German market research institute Forsa found 95% of blue-collar workers, 88% of white-collar workers, 84% of public servants, and 80% of self-employed Germans shop at Aldi.[18] One of Aldi's direct competitors internationally is Lidl.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Aldi group operates over 8,000 stores worldwide. Aldi Nord is responsible for its stores in Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal, and also operates the Trader Joe's markets in the United States. Aldi Sd's responsibilities are in the United States (operating under the Aldi name), Austria, Slovenia and Italy (as Hofer), Great Britain, Ireland, Australia, and Switzerland. Aldi Sd's first Switzerland store opened in 2005, while it has operated in Hungary since 2007. Aldi Sd had invested an estimated ?800m ($1bn; S670m) in Greece from November 2008 until pulling out on 31 December 2010.[19]\\r\\nWhile Aldi Nord has renamed its Dutch and Belgian subsidiaries Combi and Lansa to the Aldi Markt/Aldi March brand, Aldi Sd tries to maintain a regional appearance, branding its stores Aldi Sd in Germany, Aldi Suisse in Switzerland, and Hofer in Austria and Slovenia.[20]\\r\\nAldi launched in Great Britain, on 5 April 1990, when it opened its first store there in Stechford, Birmingham, using the wholly owned English registered company of Aldi Stores Limited and Aldi sales in Britain grew consistently. In October 2013, Aldi opened the 300th store in Great Britain.[21] By 2017 Aldi had over 600 stores there, and was opening them at a rate of more than one a week with the aim of having a thousand stores by 2022.[22]\\r\\nIt was still a small player in Great Britain, with a grocery share of less than 3.6%, but its importance, along with that of continental no-frills competitor Lidl was growing, with half of shoppers in Great Britain visiting Lidl or Aldi over Christmas that year. Aldi opened stores in affluent locations, including Knutsford and Bury St Edmunds.[23]\\r\\nIn much of Australia, Aldi filled a void in the discount supermarket business that arose when the discount grocery chain Franklins went out of business. Aldi opened its first store in Sydney, 2001 and has grown rapidly since, maintaining a 12.6% market share as of early 2016.[24][25]\\r\\nAldi Sd expanded to the United States under the Aldi banner, having expanded throughout the Eastern and Midwestern U.S., mostly through organic expansion, though it did buy Bottom Dollar Food in late 2014 from Delhaize Group.[26] Aldi Sd revealed expansion plans in 2015 and expanded into the Southern California market, where Aldi Nord's Trader Joe's is based.[27] On 25 November 2016 Aldi Sd confirmed that it will expand to China in late 2017.[28]\\r\\nHofer, subsidiary of Aldi Sd, opened its first 10 stores in Italy on March 1, 2018.[29]\\r\\nSome Aldi practices are common in German supermarkets but largely unique to Aldi in other countries.[citation needed] These include the system of metal gates and turnstiles forcing customers to exit through the checkout, and charging customers for shopping bags. Until 2004, Aldi stores accepted only cash (since then, German stores have accepted domestic Girocard debit cards). Debit cards also are accepted in the United States, Great Britain, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Ireland, Australia, Slovenia, and Hungary. All 4 major credit cards are accepted in the United States as of 1 March 2016. Electronic Benefit Transfer cards are also accepted in the United States.[44]\\r\\nOutside of Great Britain, United States and France, Aldi generally does not accept credit cards, though Aldi Australia accepts MasterCard and Visa for a 0.5% surcharge and Aldi Ireland accepts Visa and MasterCard with no surcharge. In the United States, as of February 2016, Aldi accepts all four major credit cards (MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover Card), and from the beginning all credit cards \\"Carte Bleue\\" (Visa, American Express or MasterCard) in France due to the banking system in France where debit cards don't exist; before this, Aldi only accepted debit cards. Aldi has accepted Visa/MasterCard without surcharge throughout Great Britain from October 2014, which had previously been accepted only in Scotland,[45] and throughout Germany from September 2015.[46][47][48]\\r\\nAldi Suisse became one of the first companies to accept the Apple Pay contactless payment system in Switzerland on 7 July 2016.[49][50]\\r\\nAldi stores are noted as examples of so-called no-frills stores that often display a variety of items at discount prices, specializing in staple items, such as food, beverages, toilet paper, sanitary articles, and other inexpensive household items. Many of its products are own brands, with the number of other brands usually limited to a maximum of two for a given item. This increases sales for each article, and lets Aldi shops be smaller than stores with more brand choice. This practice let Aldi avoid price tags, even before the introduction of barcode scanners. On many of its own brands, if feasible, Aldi will place multiple barcodes on products to speed the check out process.\\r\\nAldi mainly sells exclusively produced, custom-branded products (often very similar to and produced by major brands[51]) with brand names including Grandessa and Fit & Active.\\r\\nBranded products carried include HARIBO in Germany, Knoppers in Belgium and France, Marmite and Branston Pickle in Great Britain; and Vegemite and Milo in Australia. In the United States, major brand-name products, such as Oscar Mayer bacon, sometimes are offered as a 'special purchase': name-brand items that Aldi has received at a special price from the vendor and can offer for a reduced price. Unlike most shops, Aldi does not accept manufacturers' coupons, although some US stores successfully experimented with store coupons (e.g. $10 off a $25 purchase).\\r\\nIn addition to its standard assortment, Aldi has weekly special offers[52], some of them on more expensive products such as electronics, tools, appliances, or computers, usually from in-house electronics brand Medion and workzone[53] brand for tools. Discount items can include clothing, toys, flowers, and gifts. Specials have strict limits on quantities, and are for one week. Aldi's early computer offers in Germany (such as a Commodore 64 in 1987) resulted in those products selling out in a few hours.[54]\\r\\nAldi is the largest wine retailer in Germany.[55] Some Australian stores now sell alcoholic beverages. Some US stores also sell alcoholic beverages (mainly beer and wine) where permitted by local and state laws.\\r\\nAldi has a policy in Germany of not advertising, apart from a weekly newsletter of special prices called \\"Aldi informs\\" that is distributed in stores and by direct mail and often printed in local newspapers. It claims this is a cost saving that can be passed on to consumers. In Germany, Aldi has never used an external advertising agency.[18]\\r\\nIn the United States, it advertises in newspapers and on television, as well as print ads distributed in stores, and via the Internet.\\r\\nIn Great Britain, print and television ads have appeared since May 2005.\\r\\nIn Australia, television advertising is common and the current ads are listed on the Australian website.[56]\\r\\nIn Belgium, print, radio and television ads started appearing in late 2017. These ads were based on the positive results of taste-tests where the chain pitted its own products against common name-brand products.\\r\\nThe two stores Nord and Sd have distinct logos with Nord displaying the entire 'A' for ALDI while Sd unveiled a logo in 1982 which displays only half. In 2006, Aldi Sd modified the logo slightly and then in March 2017, unveiled a new logo which removed the blue box line around the artistic 'A' and revealed a more rounded, 3D look for the logo as well as a new font for the word 'ALDI', further differentiating it from the Aldi Nord logo which had shared the same font for the brand until then.[57][58]\\r\\nOriginally, Aldi shops were often ridiculed as being cheap shops selling low-quality goods, whose customers could not afford to shop elsewhere.[59]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, Aldi has won Supermarket of the Year two years in a row (2012/13),[60] and in 2013, Aldi won the Grocer of the Year Award.[61] However, in February 2015, Aldi narrowly lost to Waitrose for the title of Supermarket of the Year 2015. In April 2015, Aldi overtook Waitrose to become the United Kingdom's sixth-largest supermarket chain.[62] In February 2017, Aldi overtook Co-op to become the United Kingdom's fifth largest supermarket chain. [63]\\r\\nIn the United States, due to the relatively low staffing of Aldi locations compared to other supermarket chains, Aldi has a reputation of starting employees out at significantly higher than minimum wage, unusual among American supermarkets.[64][65]\\r\\nIn Ireland, Aldi has been accused of a \\"lack of corporate responsibility\\" to their farmer suppliers by the Irish Farmers' Association.[66]\\r\\nAldi has a mobile virtual network operator in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, called Aldi Talk. Aldi also operates a similar network in Australia using Telstra's 4G network, called Aldimobile.[67]\\r\\nIts Austrian and Slovenian Hofer stores serve as distributor for HoT (Hofer Telekom).\\r\\nAldi sells low cost liquor from its liquor stores. Until March 2016, Aldi had a liquor website serving the east coast of Australia. This has now been closed down, citing it wishes to focus on expanding the supermarket chain across Australia.\\r\\nIn Austria and Slovenia through its subsidiary Hofer, Aldi has a joint venture with the local petrol retailer Free Energy (FE) Trading GmbH, to create some no frills petrol stations called Diskont.[68] The 66 stations in Austria and 6 in Slovenia are on or nearby the stores, providing self-serve unleaded or diesel fuel by card-operated pumps. These have been in operation since 2009.\\r\\nIn May 2004, German Aldi stores sold garden furniture made of Indonesian Meranti wood. Because it was not able to show that it was sourced legally (70% of Indonesian timber is illegally logged), environmental organisations pressured Aldi to stop selling the furniture.[69] Within days Aldi announced that all of the timber used in its products would bear the FSC certificate, which promotes sustainable forestry.[70]\\r\\nIn January 2013, Aldi Germany was caught up in the horse meat scandal.[71] On 8 February 2013, the store group admitted that some of its frozen lasagne and spaghetti bolognese products contained 30%ÿ100% horse meat rather than the advertised beef and that it had terminated its relationship with the supplier responsible for the adulterated product.[72]\\r\\nIn January 2014, following a mislabelling of turkey meat as halal, Aldi apologised and said, \\"Aldi does not label any products as halal-certified\\".[73] In May 2015, Aldi apologised again after it sold pork products labelled as halal.[74][75]","input":"Where was the first aldi store in uk?"},{"output":"around 1440","context":"A printing press is a device for applying pressure to an inked surface resting upon a print medium (such as paper or cloth), thereby transferring the ink. This was a dramatic improvement on earlier printing methods in which the cloth, paper or other medium was brushed or rubbed repeatedly to achieve the transfer of ink, and accelerated the process. Typically used for texts, the invention and spread of the printing press was one of the most influential events in the second millennium.[1][2]\\r\\nThe printing press was invented in the Holy Roman Empire by the German Johannes Gutenberg around 1440, based on existing screw presses. Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed a printing system, by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe. In East Asia, where it was invented, the usefulness of movable type was limited by the complexity of the writing system and, without the hand mould, the production of sorts (individual letters of type) was slow. In Europe, the two inventions, the hand mould and the printing press, together drastically reduced the cost of printing books and other documents, particularly in short print runs.\\r\\nThe printing press spread within several decades to over two hundred cities in a dozen European countries.[3] By 1500, printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million volumes.[3] In the 16th century, with presses spreading further afield, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[3] The operation of a press became synonymous with the enterprise of printing, and lent its name to a new branch of media, \\"the press\\".[4]\\r\\nIn Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication, which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information and (revolutionary) ideas transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities. The sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its peoples led to the rise of proto-nationalism, and accelerated by the development of European vernacular languages, to the detriment of Latin's status as lingua franca.[5] In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale.[6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rapid economic and socio-cultural development of late medieval society in Europe created favorable intellectual and technological conditions for Gutenberg's invention: the entrepreneurial spirit of emerging capitalism increasingly made its impact on medieval modes of production, fostering economic thinking and improving the efficiency of traditional work-processes. The sharp rise of medieval learning and literacy amongst the middle class led to an increased demand for books which the time-consuming hand-copying method fell far short of accommodating.[7]\\r\\nTechnologies preceding the press that led to the press's invention included: manufacturing of paper, development of ink, woodblock printing, and distribution of eye-glasses.[8] At the same time, a number of medieval products and technological processes had reached a level of maturity which allowed their potential use for printing purposes. Gutenberg took up these far-flung strands, combined them into one complete and functioning system, and perfected the printing process through all its stages by adding a number of inventions and innovations of his own:\\r\\nThe screw press which allowed direct pressure to be applied on flat-plane was already of great antiquity in Gutenberg's time and was used for a wide range of tasks.[9] Introduced in the 1st century AD by the Romans, it was commonly employed in agricultural production for pressing wine grapes and (olive) oil fruit, both of which formed an integral part of the mediterranean and medieval diet.[10] The device was also used from very early on in urban contexts as a cloth press for printing patterns.[11] Gutenberg may have also been inspired by the paper presses which had spread through the German lands since the late 14th century and which worked on the same mechanical principles.[12]\\r\\nGutenberg adopted the basic design, thereby mechanizing the printing process.[13] Printing, however, put a demand on the machine quite different from pressing. Gutenberg adapted the construction so that the pressing power exerted by the platen on the paper was now applied both evenly and with the required sudden elasticity. To speed up the printing process, he introduced a movable undertable with a plane surface on which the sheets could be swiftly changed.[14]\\r\\nThe concept of movable type was not new in the 15th century; movable type printing had been invented in China during the Song dynasty, and was later used in Korea during the Goryeo Dynasty, where metal movable-type printing technology was developed in 1234.[15][16] In Europe, sporadic evidence that the typographical principle, the idea of creating a text by reusing individual characters, was well understood and employed in pre-Gutenberg Europe had been cropping up since the 12th century and possibly before. The known examples range from Germany (Prfening inscription) to England (letter tiles) to Italy.[17] However, the various techniques employed (imprinting, punching and assembling individual letters) did not have the refinement and efficiency needed to become widely accepted.\\r\\nGutenberg greatly improved the process by treating typesetting and printing as two separate work steps. A goldsmith by profession, he created his type pieces from a lead-based alloy which suited printing purposes so well that it is still used today.[18] The mass production of metal letters was achieved by his key invention of a special hand mould, the matrix.[19] The Latin alphabet proved to be an enormous advantage in the process because, in contrast to logographic writing systems, it allowed the type-setter to represent any text with a theoretical minimum of only around two dozen different letters.[20]\\r\\nAnother factor conducive to printing arose from the book existing in the format of the codex, which had originated in the Roman period.[21] Considered the most important advance in the history of the book prior to printing itself, the codex had completely replaced the ancient scroll at the onset of the Middle Ages (500 AD).[22] The codex holds considerable practical advantages over the scroll format; it is more convenient to read (by turning pages), is more compact, less costly, and, in particular, unlike the scroll, both recto and verso could be used for writing ? and printing.[23]\\r\\nA fourth development was the early success of medieval papermakers at mechanizing paper manufacture. The introduction of water-powered paper mills, the first certain evidence of which dates to 1282,[24] allowed for a massive expansion of production and replaced the laborious handcraft characteristic of both Chinese[25] and Muslim papermaking.[26] Papermaking centres began to multiply in the late 13th century in Italy, reducing the price of paper to one sixth of parchment and then falling further; papermaking centers reached Germany a century later.[27]\\r\\nDespite this it appears that the final breakthrough of paper depended just as much on the rapid spread of movable-type printing.[28] It is notable that codices of parchment, which in terms of quality is superior to any other writing material,[29] still had a substantial share in Gutenberg's edition of the 42-line Bible.[30] After much experimentation, Gutenberg managed to overcome the difficulties which traditional water-based inks caused by soaking the paper, and found the formula for an oil-based ink suitable for high-quality printing with metal type.[31]\\r\\nA printing press, in its classical form, is a standing mechanism, ranging from 5 to 7 feet (1.5 to 2.1?m) long, 3 feet (0.91?m) wide, and 7 feet (2.1?m) tall. Type, small metal letters that have a raised letter on one end, is arranged into pages and placed in a frame to make a forme, which itself is placed onto a flat stone, 'bed,' or 'coffin.' The text is inked using two balls, pads mounted on handles. The balls were made of dog skin leather, because it has no pores[33], and stuffed with sheep's wool and were inked. This ink was then applied to the text evenly. One damp piece of paper was then taken from a heap of paper and placed on the tympan. The paper was damp as this lets the type 'bite' into the paper better. Small pins hold the paper in place. The paper is now held between a frisket and tympan (two frames covered with paper or parchment).\\r\\nThese are folded down, so that the paper lies on the surface of the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a windlass mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.\\r\\nJohannes Gutenberg's work on the printing press began in approximately 1436 when he partnered with Andreas Dritzehna man who had previously instructed in gem-cuttingand Andreas Heilmann, owner of a paper mill.[34] However, it was not until a 1439 lawsuit against Gutenberg that an official record existed; witnesses' testimony discussed Gutenberg's types, an inventory of metals (including lead), and his type molds.[34]\\r\\nHaving previously worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He was the first to make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions,[34] a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His type case is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.[35]\\r\\nGutenberg is also credited with the introduction of an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies.[36] A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under the imprint of his successors Johann Fust and Peter Sch?ffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.[37]\\r\\nThe Printing Revolution occurred when the spread of the printing press facilitated the wide circulation of information and ideas, acting as an \\"agent of change\\" through the societies that it reached. (Eisenstein (1980))\\r\\nThe invention of mechanical movable type printing led to a huge increase of printing activities across Europe within only a few decades. From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century.[39] As early as 1480, there were printers active in 110 different places in Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, England, Bohemia and Poland.[3] From that time on, it is assumed that \\"the printed book was in universal use in Europe\\".[3]\\r\\nIn Italy, a center of early printing, print shops had been established in 77 cities and towns by 1500. At the end of the following century, 151 locations in Italy had seen at one time printing activities, with a total of nearly three thousand printers known to be active. Despite this proliferation, printing centres soon emerged; thus, one third of the Italian printers published in Venice.[40]\\r\\nBy 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies.[3] In the following century, their output rose tenfold to an estimated 150 to 200 million copies.[3]\\r\\nEuropean printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing about 1,500 impressions per workday.[41] By comparison, book printing in East Asia, did not use presses and was solely done by block printing.[42]\\r\\nOf Erasmus's work, at least 750,000 copies were sold during his lifetime alone (1469ÿ1536).[43] In the early days of the Reformation, the revolutionary potential of bulk printing took princes and papacy alike by surprise. In the period from 1518 to 1524, the publication of books in Germany alone skyrocketed sevenfold; between 1518 and 1520, Luther's tracts were distributed in 300,000 printed copies.[44]\\r\\nThe rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first newspapers (see Relation) which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.[45]\\r\\nIncunable are surviving pre-16th century print works which are collected by many of the libraries in Europe and North America.[46]\\r\\nThe printing press was also a factor in the establishment of a community of scientists who could easily communicate their discoveries through the establishment of widely disseminated scholarly journals, helping to bring on the scientific revolution.[citation needed] Because of the printing press, authorship became more meaningful and profitable. It was suddenly important who had said or written what, and what the precise formulation and time of composition was. This allowed the exact citing of references, producing the rule, \\"One Author, one work (title), one piece of information\\" (Giesecke, 1989; 325). Before, the author was less important, since a copy of Aristotle made in Paris would not be exactly identical to one made in Bologna. For many works prior to the printing press, the name of the author has been entirely lost.[citation needed]\\r\\nBecause the printing process ensured that the same information fell on the same pages, page numbering, tables of contents, and indices became common, though they previously had not been unknown.[citation needed] The process of reading also changed, gradually moving over several centuries from oral readings to silent, private reading.[citation needed] Over the next 200 years, the wider availability of printed materials led to a dramatic rise in the adult literacy rate throughout Europe.[47]\\r\\nThe printing press was an important step towards the democratization of knowledge.[48][49] Within 50 or 60 years of the invention of the printing press, the entire classical canon had been reprinted and widely promulgated throughout Europe (Eisenstein, 1969; 52). Now that more people had access to knowledge both new and old, more people could discuss these works. Furthermore, now that book production was a more commercial enterprise, the first copyright laws were passed to protect what we now would call intellectual property rights.[citation needed] On the other hand, the printing press was criticized for allowing the dissemination of information which may have been incorrect.[50][51]\\r\\nA second outgrowth of this popularization of knowledge was the decline of Latin as the language of most published works, to be replaced by the vernacular language of each area, increasing the variety of published works. The printed word also helped to unify and standardize the spelling and syntax of these vernaculars, in effect 'decreasing' their variability. This rise in importance of national languages as opposed to pan-European Latin is cited[who?] as one of the causes of the rise of nationalism in Europe.\\r\\nA third consequence of popularization of printing was on the economy. Printing press was associated with higher levels of city growth.[52] Publication of trade related manuals and books teaching techniques like double-entry bookkeeping, increased reliability of trade and led to decline of merchant guilds and rise of individual traders.[53]\\r\\nFor years, book printing was considered a true art form. Typesetting, or the placement of the characters on the page, including the use of ligatures, was passed down from master to apprentice. In Germany, the art of typesetting was termed the \\"black art\\", in allusion to the ink-covered printers. It has largely been replaced by computer typesetting programs, which make it easy to get similar results more quickly and with less physical labor. Some practitioners continue to print books the way Gutenberg did. For example, there is a yearly convention of traditional book printers in Mainz, Germany.\\r\\nSome theorists, such as McLuhan, Eisenstein, Kittler, and Giesecke, see an \\"alphabetic monopoly\\" as having developed from printing, removing the role of the image from society. Other authors stress that printed works themselves are a visual medium. Certainly, modern developments in printing have revitalized the role of illustrations.\\r\\nAt the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the mechanics of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press were still essentially unchanged, although new materials in its construction, amongst other innovations, had gradually improved its printing efficiency. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had built a press completely from cast iron which reduced the force required by 90%, while doubling the size of the printed area.[54] With a capacity of 480 pages per hour, it doubled the output of the old style press.[55] Nonetheless, the limitations inherent to the traditional method of printing became obvious.\\r\\nTwo ideas altered the design of the printing press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818.[56] Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807.[54] Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press \\"much like a hand press connected to a steam engine.\\"[54] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.\\r\\nKoenig and Bauer sold two of their first models to The Times in London in 1814, capable of 1,100 impressions per hour. The first edition so printed was on 28 November 1814. They went on to perfect the early model so that it could print on both sides of a sheet at once. This began the long process of making newspapers available to a mass audience (which in turn helped spread literacy), and from the 1820s changed the nature of book production, forcing a greater standardization in titles and other metadata. Their company Koenig & Bauer AG is still one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing presses today.\\r\\nThe steam powered rotary printing press, invented in 1843 in the United States by Richard M. Hoe,[57] allowed millions of copies of a page in a single day. Mass production of printed works flourished after the transition to rolled paper, as continuous feed allowed the presses to run at a much faster pace.\\r\\nBy the late 1930s or early 1940s, rotary presses had increased substantially in efficiency: a model by Platen Printing Press was capable of performing 2,500 to 3,000 impressions per hour.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlso, in the middle of the 19th century, there was a separate development of jobbing presses, small presses capable of printing small-format pieces such as billheads, letterheads, business cards, and envelopes. Jobbing presses were capable of quick set-up (average setup time for a small job was under 15 minutes) and quick production (even on treadle-powered jobbing presses it was considered normal to get 1,000 impressions per hour [iph] with one pressman, with speeds of 1,500 iph often attained on simple envelope work).[citation needed] Job printing emerged as a reasonably cost-effective duplicating solution for commerce at this time.\\r\\nModel of the Common Press, used from 1650 to 1850\\r\\nPrinting press from 1811\\r\\nStanhope press from 1842\\r\\nImprenta Press V John Sherwin from 1860\\r\\nAt the same time, then, as the printing press in the physical, technological sense was invented, 'the press' in the extended sense of the word also entered the historical stage. The phenomenon of publishing was born.\\r\\nGutenberg's invention took full advantage of the degree of abstraction in representing language forms that was offered by the alphabet and by the Western forms of script that were current in the fifteenth century.\\r\\nThe most momentous development in the history of the book until the invention of printing was the replacement of the roll by the codex; this we may define as a collection of sheets of any material, folded double and fastened together at the back or spine, and usually protected by covers. (p. 1)\\r\\nIn the West, the only inhibiting expense in the production of writings for an increasingly literate market was the manual labor of the scribe himself. With his mechanization by movable-type printing in the 1440s, the manufacture of paper, until then relatively confined, began to spread very widely. The Paper Revolution of the thirteenth century thus entered a new era.\\r\\nDespite all that has been said above, even the strongest supporters of papyrus would not deny that parchment of good quality is the finest writing material ever devised by man. It is immensely strong, remains flexible indefinitely under normal conditions, does not deteriorate with age, and possesses a smooth, even surface which is both pleasant to the eye and provides unlimited scope for the finest writing and illumination.\\r\\nFrom old price tables it can be deduced that the capacity of a printing press around 1600, assuming a fifteen-hour workday, was between 3,200 and 3,600 impressions per day.\\r\\nThe outstanding difference between the two ends of the Old World was the absence of screw-presses from China, but this is only another manifestation of the fact that this basic mechanism was foreign to that culture.\\r\\nIn East Asia, both woodblock and movable type printing were manual reproduction techniques, that is hand printing.\\r\\nChinese paper was suitable only for calligraphy or block-printing; there were no screw-based presses in the east, because they were not wine-drinkers, didnt have olives, and used other means to dry their paper.\\r\\nOn the effects of the printing press\\r\\nTechnology of printing","input":"When was the printing press invented in europe?"},{"output":"1 inch (2.54 cm) all around","context":"In typography, a margin is the area between the main content of a page and the page edges.[1] The margin helps to define where a line of text begins and ends. When a page is justified the text is spread out to be flush with the left and right margins. When two pages of content are combined next to each other (known as a two-page spread), the space between the two pages is known as the gutter.[2] (Any space between columns of text is a gutter.) The top and bottom margins of a page are also called \\"head\\" and \\"foot\\", respectively. The term \\"margin\\" can also be used to describe the edge of internal content, such as the right or left edge of a column of text.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nMarks made in the margins are called marginalia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMargins are an important method of organizing the written word, and have a long history. In ancient Egypt, writing was recorded on papyrus scrolls.[4] Egyptian papyrus scrolls could reach up to 30 meters in length, and contained text organized in columns laid out from left to right along the scroll.[5] Columns were referred to as pagina (or pages) and were separated by margins, so that scrolls could be unrolled horizontally, uncovering individual sections one by one.[6] Thus, in papyrus scrolls margins performed the function of visually signaling to readers when to stop reading and move down to the next line of text.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first 3 centuries B.C.E., the scroll gradually began to be replaced by the codex.[8] Rather than storing text on one long, continuous piece of whatever papyrus, the codex was constructed of individual pieces of parchment, bound together on one side.[9] Now that each page was separated physically from all the rest, margins became less necessary in distinguishing the beginning and end of the text-block. However, they took on a new role. Before the codex, commentaries about a text were usually recorded on separate scrolls.[10] With the advent of the codex, margins (having been largely stripped of their original function) became extra space which could be used to incorporate commentaries next to the original text.[11] Extra text and images included in the margins of codices are called marginalia. Scholarly commentaries included in margins next to their source text are known as scholia. However, this was not the only purpose margins served in the codex. Even when no commentaries were added, most books continued to leave space around the text-block on all sides of each page. This marginal space served several practical purposes. Leaving blank space around text protects the typeblock by giving the reader somewhere to put his or her thumbs while holding the book.[12] In addition, that blank space serves an important role in reading and understanding text.[13] The exact effect of margins on legibility has been debated,[14] but some scholars contend that without empty space to offset text, the task of reading could take more than twice as long.[15] Finally, margins serve an aesthetic function by framing text inside a blank border.[16][17]\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the invention of the printing press, books began to be manufactured in large numbers.[18] As paper began to be produced in bulk, page size and shape were increasingly determined by the size and shape of mould which was most practical for producers.[19] As pages became more standardized, so did the size and shape of margins.[20] In general, margins in books have grown smaller over time. The wide margins common during the Renaissance have given way to much narrower proportions.[21] However, there is still much variation depending on the size and purpose of the book.[22][23]\\r\\n\\r\\nComputers and the Internet have revolutionized our consumption of the written word. Books can now exist without physical pages, and text can be viewed on a myriad of devices. In the early days of the Internet, the concept of margins was foreign to web browsers.[24] However, as computer screens got bigger this became an issue for the readability and aesthetics of text.[25] The invention of more sophisticated techniques such as CSS allowed designers to control the margins of their web pages and leave more white space.[26] Although margin-less web pages do still exist, today it is generally understood that having wide enough margins to provide adequate white space around text is important to the usability and readability of digital text.[27][28][29] In fact, margins become even more important because web content shares visual space with other elements such as the web browser's interface, as well as other icons and windows.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nMargins also play an important role in digital word-processing. The default margins for Microsoft Word from version 2007 onward have been 1 inch (2.54 cm) all around; in Word 2003, the default top and bottom margins were 1 inch (2.54 cm), but 1.25 inches (3.17 cm) were given at the left and the right.[31][32] OpenOffice Writer has 0.79 inch (2 cm) all around.[33] LaTeX varies the width of its margins depending on the font size. By default, LaTeX uses 1.5 inches margin sizes for 12pt documents, 1.75 inches for 11pt, and 1.875 inches for 10ptrelatively large margins. These adjustments are intended to allow a maximum of 66 characters per line, to increase readability.[34][35] However, studies have shown that longer line lengths (more than 66 characters per line) can improve readability.[36][37]","input":"What is the standard margin size microsoft word?"},{"output":"Despacito","context":"This list of most-liked YouTube videos contains the top 40 videos with the most likes of all time, as derived from YouTube charts.[1] The like count is taken directly from the page of the video itself.

They were announced during a Google event on October 4, 2017, as the successors to the Pixel and Pixel XL. They were released on October 19, 2017, and serve as the second set of smartphones in the Google Pixel hardware line.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn early March 2017, Google's Rick Osterloh confirmed that they would bring a \\"next-gen\\" Pixel phone later that year. He stated it would \\"stay premium\\" and that there would be no \\"cheap Pixel\\".[3]\\r\\nGoogle originally intended to use HTC to manufacture both their 2017 flagships, but later shifted to LG to manufacture the bigger Pixel 2 XL. The unreleased device that was supposed to be the Pixel 2 XL under the codename \\"Muskie\\", was later re-developed by HTC into the HTC U11+.[4]\\r\\nThe Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are currently carried in the United States by Verizon and Project Fi.\\r\\nThe back of the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL is made from aluminum with a thin \\"premium coating\\" of plastic and has a top section made from glass to provide wireless transmissivity.[5] Unlike the original Pixel XL, which was simply an enlarged version of the Pixel design with no other changes, the Pixel 2 XL's external design differs from its smaller sibling, employing a taller 18:9 P-OLED display instead of the Pixel 2's 16:9 AMOLED.\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are both powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, coupled with 4?GB LPDDR4X RAM.

The camera also contains phase-detection autofocus, laser autofocus, and HDR+ processing. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also include the Intel-designed Pixel Visual Core image processor for faster and lower power image processing,[6] though it was not enabled until Android 8.1 was released in January 2018.[7][8] The camera does not allow capturing Raw images and lacks manual controls. Unlike Apple's iPhone 8 and IPhone X, the Pixels do not have support for 4K video at 60 FPS, as the processor is not powerful enough.[9][10] Although the camera has Optical Image Stabilization it is unable to remove some high frequency vibrations that other smartphones are able to remove.[11] Pixel 2 owners receive free unlimited storage for all photos and videos taken on the phone in original quality through the end of 2020, with unlimited high-quality storage continuing afterwards.[12]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL support USB Power Delivery quick charging, has a fingerprint sensor on the rear, has IP67 dust and water resistance and is Daydream-ready.[13]\\r\\nThe phones ship with stock Android 8.0 \\"Oreo\\" on launch. Google has promised three years of software and security updates,[14] making it closer to the average four years of support that Apple provides for its iPhones.[15]\\r\\nThe new Pixels also include a feature called \\"Active Edge\\". With this, the Google Assistant can be launched by squeezing the phone's sides, similar to the HTC U11's \\"Edge Sense\\" feature.\\r\\nThis phone was also released with the new Google Lens app, which is designed to bring up relevant information using visual analysis by the camera. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL also automatically reverse searches songs which are playing around the device.[16]\\r\\nAndroid 8.1 Oreo was released for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL on December 5, 2017.[17]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 camera received a score of 98 from DxOMark, making it the highest performing mobile device camera at the end of 2017, and was overtaken in March 2018 by Samsung's Galaxy S9+.[18]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL received mixed reviews. The phone was praised for the camera quality and water resistance,[19] but was criticized for the removal of the headphone jack,[20] particularly after Google mocked Apple for doing the same with its iPhone 7 phone at the launch of the first generation Pixel phone just 12 months prior.[21] Google was also criticized for the price of the USB-C to 3.5?mm headphone adapter it sells, which costs US$20 while Apple's Lightning to 3.5?mm adapter costs US$9,[22] as well as for not including headphones with the phone. However, news outlets noted that because USB-C is a standard interface, unlike Lightning, there are a variety of third-party adapters that retail for less than Google's official one.[23] Google later dropped the price of the adapter to US$9, keeping the price in-line with Apple's offering.[24][25][26]\\r\\nYouTuber JerryRigEverything, who performs durability tests on various smartphones, criticized Google for their design choice with the antenna lines on the sides of the handset. When he bent the Pixel 2, it cracked at the antenna line near the middle of the phone, voiding its water resistance and warranty, while most other phones from competitors pass his bend test. This does not apply to the Pixel 2 XL.[27][28][29]\\r\\nThe design of the smaller Pixel 2 was regarded as plain, and its big chunky bezels were not well received, considering that earlier 2017 phones like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and LG G6 had moved to nearly bezel-less screens.[30]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 XL screen became infamous for quality control issues, a flaw shared with the LG V30 which also has the same manufacturer and P-OLED screen type. The Pixel 2 XL has a blue tint visible on the screen when the phone is viewed at an angle. Many were dissatisfied[31][32] and it was speculated that Google had installed the polarizer incorrectly.[33] However, when Google addressed the tint, they stated that it was a design choice to have the blue tint to go along with the cooler color temperature used by the screen (it is calibrated to a D67 white point, which is 6700K).[34][35]\\r\\nVlad Savov of The Verge has complained of under-saturated and distorted OLED displays,[36] and there have also been reports of screen burn-in on some Pixel 2 XL units.[37]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 XL also suffers from a \\"black smear\\" problem, which occurs when a group of black pixels transition to colored ones, and tend to linger for a while, before changing to their expected state.[38][39]\\r\\nGoogle conducted an investigation and said that a software update would be coming soon that would add a new mode for more saturated colors, reducing the maximum brightness of the Pixel 2 XL devices by 50 cd/m2 to reduce load on the display, and fading out the navigation bar after a period of inactivity.[40] The November security patch came with three new screen modes that Google promised earlier,[41] although Google has also said that further enhancements would be included in a separate software update to be released in December.[42] Google also extended device warranty to two years for both devices worldwide.[43]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 XL has an issue where the screen may flash randomly. It occurs when the phone is locked or unlocked.[44]\\r\\nHundreds of Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL owners have been complaining of high-pitched and clicking sounds coming from the phone.[45] Google investigated the issue and recommended turning off NFC to temporarily fix the problem until a software update comes out.[46][47] The November security patch fixed the clicking sound as well as the KRACK WPA2 Wi-Fi security issue, however, it did not fix the buzzing sounds heard during calls on some devices. Google has promised a fix in a future update.[48]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 XL has a volume flaw that reduces the sound level of audio clips sent through messaging apps such as Google Allo, Instagram, and Telegram among others. Google is aware of the problem and is looking into it.[49]\\r\\nSome of the USB-C to 3.5mm adapters for the headphones do not work. In some cases, rebooting the phone can fix the issue temporarily. Google is offering replacements for the faulty adapters.[50][51]\\r\\nSome Pixel 2 XL suffer from speaker rattling when playing content or even during phone calls.[52]\\r\\nMultiple users reported that the microphone can randomly stop working. A possible solution is to blow into the microphone.[53]\\r\\nSome units suffer from Bluetooth connectivity issues.[54]\\r\\nThere is an issue where Google Assistant does not work with some Bluetooth headphones.[55]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 XL comes with a charger capable of fast charging at 18W, but the phone is not able to charge at more than 10.5W, taking two and a half hours for a full charge.[56] Below 20?C (68?F) the charging speed is just a mere 3-4W, but the phone will still display \\"Charging rapidly\\", which is misleading.[57]\\r\\nThe phones are known to randomly reboot. Google has promised a fix in the coming weeks.[58] The random reboots are believed to be caused by the LTE modem. Google has not been able to fix this issue in the latest Android 8.1 release.[59]\\r\\nThe Android 8.1 update introduces a regression in the Pixel 2 XL making the fingerprint sensor slower. Google is investigating the issue.[60][61]\\r\\nThe phones have issues with Wi-Fi mesh networks, where disconnects are common. Google is already investigating this issue.[62]\\r\\nUsers started reporting battery drain issues after the February security update.[63] The battery drain become worse after the April security updates. Google is looking for a fix.[64]\\r\\nUsers are reporting proximity sensor issues. Google is aware of the issue and looking for a fix.[65]\\r\\nSome users are having issues making calls and receiving MMS messages.[66] Google claims these issues are fixed but users are still complaining about them.[67][68]\\r\\nThe Pixel 2 produces blurry panoramas. Google has known about this issue since December 2017, but has not been able to deliver a fix.[69]\\r\\nSome Pixel 2 XL devices also fail to register touch near the edges of the screen.[70] Android 8.1 fixes this issue.[71]\\r\\nSome Pixel 2 XL units suffer from poor audio recording quality. The recorded audio is high-pitched and distorted.[72] Android 8.1 fixes this issue.[73]\\r\\nSome Pixel 2 XL devices were shipped to consumers without an operating system, rendering them unusable.[74][75][76][77]\\r\\nMany users are reporting that unlocked devices have a locked bootloader.[78][79] Google fixed the issue, but the solution includes factory resetting the device.[80]\\r\\nIn the United States, Verizon and Project Fi are the exclusive carriers for the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. They are available direct-to-consumer for use on any wireless network through Google's online store, or from Best Buy and Target.[81]\\r\\nOn March 21, 2018, Google did a temporary offer if a consumer financed a Pixel for 2 years the consumer receives $200 cashback, to compete with the Samsung Galaxy S9 and iPhone X. The promotion ended March 31, 2018.[82]","input":"When was the google pixel 2 xl released?"},{"output":"estuarine fisheries","context":"The Calusa (/k??lu?s?/ k?-LOO-s?) were a Native American people of Florida's southwest coast. Calusa society developed from that of archaic peoples of the Everglades region. Previous indigenous cultures had lived in the area for thousands of years.\\r\\nAt the time of European contact in the 16th and 17th centuries, the historic Calusa were the people of the Caloosahatchee culture. They are notable for having developed a complex culture based on estuarine fisheries rather than agriculture. Calusa territory reached from Charlotte Harbor to Cape Sable, all of present-day Charlotte and Lee counties, and may have included the Florida Keys at times. They had the highest population density of South Florida; estimates of total population at the time of European contact range from 10,000 to several times that, but these are speculative.\\r\\nCalusa political influence and control also extended over other tribes in southern Florida, including the Mayaimi around Lake Okeechobee, and the Tequesta and Jaega on the southeast coast of the peninsula. Calusa influence may have also extended to the Ais tribe on the central east coast of Florida.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly Spanish and French sources referred to the tribe, its chief town, and its chief as Calos, Calus, Caalus, and Carlos. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, a Spaniard held captive by the Calusa in the 16th century, recorded that Calusa meant \\"fierce people\\" in their language. By the early 19th century, Anglo-Americans in the area used the term Calusa for the people. It is based on the Creek and Mikasuki (languages of the present-day Seminole and Miccosukee nations) ethnonym for the people who had lived around the Caloosahatchee River (also from the Creek language).[2]\\r\\nJuan Rogel, a Jesuit missionary to the Calusa in the late 1560s, noted the chief's name as Carlos but wrote that the name of the \\"kingdom\\" was Escampaba, with an alternate spelling of Escampaha. Rogel also stated that the chief's name was Caalus, and that the Spanish had changed it to Carlos. Marquardt quotes a statement from the 1570s that \\"the Bay of Carlos ... in the Indian language is called Escampaba, for the cacique of this town, who afterward called himself Carlos in devotion to the Emperor\\" (Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor). Escampaba may be related to a place named Stapaba, which was identified in the area on an early 16th-century map.[2]\\r\\nPaleo-Indians entered what is now Florida at least 12,000 years ago. By around 5000 BC, people started living in villages near wetlands. Favored sites were likely occupied for multiple generations. Florida's climate had reached current conditions and the sea had risen close to its present level by about 3000 BC. People commonly occupied both fresh and saltwater wetlands. Because of their reliance on shellfish, they accumulated large shell middens during this period. Many people lived in large villages with purpose-built earthwork mounds, such as those at Horr's Island. People began creating fired pottery in Florida by 2000 BC.[3]\\r\\nBy about 500 BC, the Archaic culture, which had been fairly uniform across Florida, began to devolve into more distinct regional cultures.[3] Some Archaic artifacts have been found in the region later occupied by the Calusa, including one site classified as early Archaic, and dated prior to 5000 BC. There is evidence that the people intensively exploited Charlotte Harbor aquatic resources before 3500 BC. Undecorated pottery belonging to the early Glades culture appeared in the region around 500 BC. Pottery distinct from the Glades tradition developed in the region around AD 500, marking the beginning of the Caloosahatchee culture. This lasted until about 1750, and included the historic Calusa people. By 880, a complex society had developed with high population densities. Later periods in the Caloosahatchee culture are defined in the archaeological record by the appearance of pottery from other traditions.\\r\\nThe Caloosahatchee culture inhabited the Florida west coast from Estero Bay to Charlotte Harbor and inland about halfway to Lake Okeechobee, approximately covering what are now Charlotte and Lee counties. At the time of first European contact, the Caloosahatchee culture region formed the core of the Calusa domain. Artifacts related to fishing changed slowly over this period, with no obvious breaks in tradition that might indicate a replacement of the population.[4]\\r\\nBetween 500 and 1000, the undecorated, sand-tempered pottery that had been common in the area was replaced by \\"Belle Glade Plain\\" pottery. This was made with clay containing spicules from freshwater sponges (Spongilla), and it first appeared inland in sites around Lake Okeechobee. This change may have resulted from the people's migration from the interior to the coastal region, or may reflect trade and cultural influences. There was little change in the pottery tradition after this. The Calusa were descended from people who had lived in the area for at least 1,000 years prior to European contact, and possibly for much longer than that.[4]\\r\\nThe Calusa had a stratified society, consisting of \\"commoners\\" and \\"nobles\\" in Spanish terms. A few leaders governed the tribe. They were supported by the labor of the majority of the Calusa. The leaders included the tribal chief, or \\"king\\"; a military leader (capitn general in Spanish); and a chief priest. In 1564, according to a Spanish source, the priest was the chief's father, and the military leader was his cousin. The Spanish documented four cases of known succession to the position of paramount chief, recording most names in Spanish form. Senequne succeeded his brother (name unknown), and was in turn succeeded by his son Carlos. Carlos was succeeded by his cousin (and brother-in-law) Felipe, who was in turn succeeded by another cousin of Carlos, Pedro. The Spanish reported that the chief was expected to marry his sister.[5] The contemporary archeologists MacMahon and Marquardt suggest this statement may have been a misunderstanding of a requirement to marry a \\"clan-sister\\". The chief also married women from subject towns and allied tribes. This use of marriages to secure alliances was demonstrated when Carlos offered his sister Antonia in marriage to the Spanish explorer Pedro Menndez de Avils in 1566.[5]\\r\\nThe Calusa diet at settlements along the coast and estuaries consisted primarily of fish, in particular pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), pigfish (redmouth grunt), (Orthopristis chrysoptera) and hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis). These small fish were supplemented by larger bony fish, sharks and rays, mollusks, crustaceans, ducks, sea turtles and land turtles, and land animals. When Pedro Menndez de Avils visited in 1566, the Calusa served only fish and oysters to the Spanish. An analysis of faunal remains at one coastal habitation site, the Wightman site (on Sanibel Island), showed that more than 93 percent of the energy from animals in the diet came from fish and shellfish, less than 6 percent of the energy came from mammals, and less than 1 percent came from birds and reptiles. By contrast, at an inland site, Platt Island, mammals (primarily deer) accounted for more than 60 percent of the energy from animal meat, while fish provided just under 20 percent.[6]\\r\\nSome authors have argued that the Calusa cultivated maize and Zamia integrifolia (coontie) for food. But Widmer argues that the evidence for maize cultivation by the Calusa depends on the proposition that the Narvez and de Soto expeditions landed in Charlotte Harbor rather than Tampa Bay, which is now generally discounted. No Zamia pollen has been found at any site associated with the Calusas, nor does Zamia grow in the wetlands that made up most of the Calusa environment. Marquardt notes that the Calusa turned down the offer of agricultural tools from the Spanish, saying that they had no need for them. The Calusa gathered a variety of wild berries, fruits, nuts, roots and other plant parts. Widmer cites George Murdock's estimate that only some 20 percent of the Calusa diet consisted of wild plants that they gathered. However, no evidence of plant food was found at the Wightman site. There is evidence that as early as 2,000 years ago, the Calusa cultivated papaya (Catrica papaya), a gourd of the species Cucurbita pepo, and the bottle gourd, the last two of which were used for net floats and dippers.[6]\\r\\nThe Calusa caught most of their fish with nets. Nets were woven with a standard mesh size; nets with different mesh sizes were used seasonally to catch the most abundant and useful fish available. The Calusa made bone and shell gauges that they used in net weaving. Cultivated gourds were used as net floats, and sinkers and net weights were made from mollusk shells. The Calusa also used spears, hooks, and throat gorges to catch fish. Well-preserved nets, net floats, and hooks were found at Key Marco, in the territory of the neighboring Muspa tribe.[7][8]\\r\\nMollusk shells and wood were used to make hammering and pounding tools. Mollusks shells and shark teeth were used for grating, cutting, carving and engraving. The Calusa wove nets from palm-fiber cord. Cord was also made from Cabbage Palm leaves, saw palmetto trunks, Spanish moss, false sisal (Agave decipiens) and the bark of cypress and willow trees. The Calusa also made fish traps, weirs, and fish corrals from wood and cord.[9][8] Artifacts of wood that have been found include bowls, ear ornaments, masks, plaques, \\"ornamental standards,\\" and a finely carved deer head. The plaques and other objects were often painted. To date no one has found a Calusa dugout canoe, but it is speculated that such vessels would have been constructed from cypress or pine, as used by other Florida tribes. The process of shaping the boat was achieved by burning the middle and subsequently chopping and removing the charred center, using robust shell tools. (In 1954 a dugout canoe was found during excavation for a middle school in Marathon, Florida. It was not conserved and is in poor shape, but it is displayed at the nature center in Marathon. It has been speculatively identified as Calusa in origin.)[10]\\r\\nThe Calusa lived in large, communal houses which were two stories high. When Pedro Menndez de Avils visited the capital in 1566, he described the chief's house as large enough to hold 2,000 without crowding, indicating it also served as the council house. When the chief formally received Menndez in his house, the chief sat on a raised seat surrounded by 500 of his principal men, while his sister-wife sat on another raised seat surrounded by 500 women. The chief's house was described as having two big windows, suggesting that it had walls. Five friars who stayed in the chief's house in 1697 complained that the roof let in the rain, sun and dew. The chief's house, and possibly the other houses at Calos, were built on top of earthen mounds. In a report from 1697, the Spanish noted 16 houses in the Calusa capital of Calos, which had 1,000 residents.[11]\\r\\nThe Calusa wore little clothing. The men wore a deerskin breechcloth. The Spanish left less description on what the Calusa women wore. Among most tribes in Florida for which there is documentation, the women wore skirts made of what was later called Spanish moss. The Calusa painted their bodies on a regular basis, but there was no report of tattooing among them. The men wore their hair long. The missionaries recognized that having a Calusa man cut his hair upon converting to Christianity (and European style) would be a great sacrifice. Little was recorded of jewelry or other ornamentation among the Calusa. During Menndez de Avils's visit in 1566, the chief's wife was described as wearing pearls, precious stones and gold beads around her neck. The heir of the chief wore gold in an ornament on his forehead and beads on his legs.[12]\\r\\nThe Calusa believed that three supernatural people ruled the world, that people had three souls, and that souls migrated to animals after death. The most powerful ruler governed the physical world, the second most powerful ruled human governments, and the last helped in wars, choosing which side would win. The Calusa believed that the three souls were the pupil of a person's eye, his shadow, and his reflection. The soul in the eye's pupil stayed with the body after death, and the Calusa would consult with that soul at the graveside. The other two souls left the body after death and entered into an animal. If a Calusa killed such an animal, the soul would migrate to a lesser animal and eventually be reduced to nothing.[13]\\r\\nCalusa ceremonies included processions of priests and singing women. The priests wore carved masks, which were at other times hung on the walls inside a temple. Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, an early chronicler of the Calusa, described \\"sorcerers in the shape of the devil, with some horns on their heads,\\" who ran through the town yelling like animals for four months at a time.\\r\\nThe Calusa remained committed to their belief system despite Spanish attempts to convert them to Catholicism. The \\"nobles\\" resisted conversion in part because their power and position were intimately tied to the belief system; they were intermediaries between the gods and the people. Conversion would have destroyed the source of their authority and legitimacy. The Calusa resisted physical encroachment and spiritual conversion by the Spanish and their missionaries for almost 200 years. After suffering decimation by disease, the tribe was destroyed by Creek and Yamasee raiders early in the 18th century.[14]\\r\\nLittle is known of the language of the Calusa. A dozen words for which translations were recorded and 50 or 60 place names form the entire known corpus of the language. Circumstantial evidence, primarily from Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, suggests that all of the peoples of southern Florida and the Tampa Bay area, including the Tequesta, Mayaimi, and Tocobago, as well as the Calusa, spoke dialects of a common language. This language was distinct from the languages of the Apalachee, Timucua, Mayaca, and Ais people in central and northern Florida. Julian Granberry has suggested that the Calusa language was related to the Tunica language of the lower Mississippi River Valley.[16][17]\\r\\nA few vocabulary examples from Granberry's work are listed below:[18]\\r\\n(*) denotes earlier century Calusa language records.\\r\\nGranberry has provided an inventory of phonemes to the sounds of the Calusa language.[18][17]\\r\\nConsonants\\r\\nVowels\\r\\nA Calusa ? sound is said to range between a /s/ to a /?/ sound.\\r\\nThe first recorded contact between the Calusa and Europeans was in 1513, when Juan Ponce de Le܇n landed on the west coast of Florida in May, probably at the mouth of the Caloosahatchee River, after his earlier discovery of Florida in April. The Calusa knew of the Spanish before this landing, however, as they had taken in Native American refugees from the Spanish subjugation of Cuba. The Spanish careened one of their ships, and Calusas offered to trade with them. After ten days a man who spoke Spanish approached Ponce de Le܇n's ships with a request to wait for the arrival of the Calusa chief. Soon 20 war canoes attacked the Spanish, who drove off the Calusa, killing or capturing several of them. The next day 80 \\"shielded\\" canoes attacked the Spanish ships, but the battle was inconclusive. The Spanish departed and returned to Puerto Rico. In 1517 Francisco Hernndez de C܇rdoba landed in southwest Florida on his return voyage from discovering the Yucatn. He was also attacked by the Calusa. In 1521 Ponce de Le܇n returned to southwest Florida to plant a colony, but the Calusa drove the Spanish out, mortally wounding Ponce de Le܇n.[19]\\r\\nThe Pnfilo de Narvez expedition of 1528 and the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1539 both landed in the vicinity of Tampa Bay, north of the Calusa domain. Dominican missionaries reached the Calusa domain in 1549 but withdrew because of the hostility of the tribe. Salvaged goods and survivors from wrecked Spanish ships reached the Calusa during the 1540s and 1550s. The best information about the Calusa comes from the Memoir of Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda, one of these survivors. Fontaneda was shipwrecked on the east coast of Florida, likely in the Florida Keys, about 1550, when he was thirteen years old. Although many others survived the shipwreck, only Fontaneda was spared by the tribe in whose territory they landed. Warriors killed all the adult men. Fontaneda lived with various tribes in southern Florida for the next seventeen years before being found by the Menendez de Avils expedition.[20][21]\\r\\nIn 1566 Pedro Menndez de Avils, founder of St. Augustine, made contact with the Calusa. He struck an uneasy peace with their leader Caluus, or Carlos. Menndez married Carlos' sister, who took the baptismal name Do?a Antonia at conversion. Menndez left a garrison of soldiers and a Jesuit mission, San Ant܇n de Carlos, at the Calusa capital. Hostilities erupted, and the Spanish soldiers killed Carlos, his successor Felipe, and several of the \\"nobles\\" before they abandoned their fort and mission in 1569.[22]\\r\\nFor more than a century after the Avils adventure, there was little contact between the Spanish and Calusa. Re-entering the area in 1614, Spanish forces attacked the Calusa as part of a war between the Calusa and Spanish-allied tribes around Tampa Bay. A Spanish expedition to ransom some captives held by the Calusa in 1680 was forced to turn back; neighboring tribes refused to guide the Spanish, for fear of retaliation by the Calusa. In 1697 Franciscan missionaries established a mission to the Calusa but left after a few months.[23]\\r\\nAfter the outbreak of war between Spain and England in 1702, slaving raids by Uchise Creek and Yamasee Indians allied with the English Province of Carolina began reaching far down the Florida peninsula. The English supplied firearms to the Creek and Yemasee, but the Calusa, who had isolated themselves from Europeans, had none. Ravaged by new infectious diseases introduced to the Americas by European contact and by the slaving raids, the surviving Calusa retreated south and east.\\r\\nIn 1711, the Spanish helped evacuate 270 Indians, including many Calusa, from the Florida Keys to Cuba (where almost 200 soon died). They left 1,700 behind. The Spanish founded a mission on Biscayne Bay in 1743 to serve survivors from several tribes, including the Calusa, who had gathered there and in the Florida Keys. The mission was closed after only a few months.\\r\\nWhen Spain ceded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1763, they evacuated the last remnants of the tribes of south Florida to Cuba. While a few Calusa individuals may have stayed behind and been absorbed into the Seminole, no documentation supports that.[24] Cuban fishing camps (ranchos) operated along the southwest Florida coast from the 18th century into the middle of the 19th century. Some of the \\"Spanish Indians\\" (often of mixed Spanish-Indian heritage) who worked at the fishing camps likely were descended from Calusa.[25]","input":"How did the calusa tribe get their food?"},{"output":"William Herschel","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation (IR) is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with longer wavelengths than those of visible light, and is therefore generally invisible to the human eye (although IR at wavelengths up to 1050?nm from specially pulsed lasers can be seen by humans under certain conditions [1][2][3][4]). It is sometimes called infrared light. IR wavelengths extend from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (frequency 430?THz), to 1?millimeter (300?GHz)[5] Most of the thermal radiation emitted by objects near room temperature is infrared. Like all EMR, IR carries radiant energy, and behaves both like a wave and like its quantum particle, the photon.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William Herschel, who discovered a type of invisible radiation in the spectrum lower in energy than red light, by means of its effect on a thermometer.[6] Slightly more than half of the total energy from the Sun was eventually found to arrive on Earth in the form of infrared. The balance between absorbed and emitted infrared radiation has a critical effect on Earth's climate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation is emitted or absorbed by molecules when they change their rotational-vibrational movements. It excites vibrational modes in a molecule through a change in the dipole moment, making it a useful frequency range for study of these energy states for molecules of the proper symmetry. Infrared spectroscopy examines absorption and transmission of photons in the infrared range.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation is used in industrial, scientific, military, \\r\\nlaw enforcement, and medical applications. Night-vision devices using active near-infrared illumination allow people or animals to be observed without the observer being detected. Infrared astronomy uses sensor-equipped telescopes to penetrate dusty regions of space such as molecular clouds, detect objects such as planets, and to view highly red-shifted objects from the early days of the universe.[8] Infrared thermal-imaging cameras are used to detect heat loss in insulated systems, to observe changing blood flow in the skin, and to detect overheating of electrical apparatus.\\r\\n\\r\\nExtensive uses for military and civilian applications include target acquisition, surveillance, night vision, homing, and tracking. Humans at normal body temperature radiate chiefly at wavelengths around 10?m (micrometers). Non-military uses include thermal efficiency analysis, environmental monitoring, industrial facility inspections, detection of grow-ops, remote temperature sensing, short-range wireless communication, spectroscopy, and weather forecasting.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation extends from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum at 700 nanometers (nm) to 1 millimeter (mm). This range of wavelengths corresponds to a frequency range of approximately 430?THz down to 300?GHz. Below infrared is the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\\r\\n\\r\\nSunlight, at an effective temperature of 5,780 kelvins, is composed of near thermal-spectrum radiation that is slightly more than half infrared. At zenith, sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1?kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 527 watts is infrared radiation, 445 watts is visible light, and 32 watts is ultraviolet radiation.[10] Nearly all the infrared radiation in sunlight is near infrared, shorter than 4 micrometers.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the surface of Earth, at far lower temperatures than the surface of the Sun, almost all thermal radiation consists of infrared in mid-infrared region, much longer than in sunlight. Of these natural thermal radiation processes only lightning and natural fires are hot enough to produce much visible energy, and fires produce far more infrared than visible-light energy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, objects emit infrared radiation across a spectrum of wavelengths, but sometimes only a limited region of the spectrum is of interest because sensors usually collect radiation only within a specific bandwidth. Thermal infrared radiation also has a maximum emission wavelength, which is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of object, in accordance with Wien's displacement law.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the infrared band is often subdivided into smaller sections.\\r\\n\\r\\nA commonly used sub-division scheme is:[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nNIR and SWIR is sometimes called \\"reflected infrared\\", whereas MWIR and LWIR is sometimes referred to as \\"thermal infrared\\". Due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves, typical \\"hot\\" objects, such as exhaust pipes, often appear brighter in the MW compared to the same object viewed in the LW.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe International Commission on Illumination (CIE) recommended the division of infrared radiation into the following three bands:[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nISO 20473 specifies the following scheme:[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAstronomers typically divide the infrared spectrum as follows:[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nThese divisions are not precise and can vary depending on the publication. The three regions are used for observation of different temperature ranges, and hence different environments in space.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe most common photometric system used in astronomy allocates capital letters to different spectral regions according to filters used; I, J, H, and K cover the near-infrared wavelengths; L, M, N, and Q refer to the mid-infrared region. These letters are commonly understood in reference to atmospheric windows and appear, for instance, in the titles of many papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nA third scheme divides up the band based on the response of various detectors:[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nNear-infrared is the region closest in wavelength to the radiation detectable by the human eye. mid- and far-infrared are progressively further from the visible spectrum. Other definitions follow different physical mechanisms (emission peaks, vs. bands, water absorption) and the newest follow technical reasons (the common silicon detectors are sensitive to about 1,050?nm, while InGaAs's sensitivity starts around 950?nm and ends between 1,700 and 2,600?nm, depending on the specific configuration). No international standards for these specifications are currently available.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe onset of infrared is defined (according to different standards) at various values typically between 700?nm and 800?nm, but the boundary between visible and infrared light is not precisely defined. The human eye is markedly less sensitive to light above 700?nm wavelength, so longer wavelengths make insignificant contributions to scenes illuminated by common light sources. However, particularly intense near-IR light (e.g., from IR lasers, IR LED sources, or from bright daylight with the visible light removed by colored gels) can be detected up to approximately 780?nm, and will be perceived as red light. Intense light sources providing wavelengths as long as 1050?nm can be seen as a dull red glow, causing some difficulty in near-IR illumination of scenes in the dark (usually this practical problem is solved by indirect illumination). Leaves are particularly bright in the near IR, and if all visible light leaks from around an IR-filter are blocked, and the eye is given a moment to adjust to the extremely dim image coming through a visually opaque IR-passing photographic filter, it is possible to see the Wood effect that consists of IR-glowing foliage.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn optical communications, the part of the infrared spectrum that is used is divided into seven bands based on availability of light sources transmitting/absorbing materials (fibers) and detectors:[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe C-band is the dominant band for long-distance telecommunication networks. The S and L bands are based on less well established technology, and are not as widely deployed.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation is popularly known as \\"heat radiation\\",[20] but light and electromagnetic waves of any frequency will heat surfaces that absorb them. Infrared light from the Sun accounts for 49%[21] of the heating of Earth, with the rest being caused by visible light that is absorbed then re-radiated at longer wavelengths. Visible light or ultraviolet-emitting lasers can char paper and incandescently hot objects emit visible radiation. Objects at room temperature will emit radiation concentrated mostly in the 8 to 25?m band, but this is not distinct from the emission of visible light by incandescent objects and ultraviolet by even hotter objects (see black body and Wien's displacement law).[22]\\r\\n\\r\\nHeat is energy in transit that flows due to temperature difference. Unlike heat transmitted by thermal conduction or thermal convection, thermal radiation can propagate through a vacuum. Thermal radiation is characterized by a particular spectrum of many wavelengths that is associated with emission from an object, due to the vibration of its molecules at a given temperature. Thermal radiation can be emitted from objects at any wavelength, and at very high temperatures such radiations are associated with spectra far above the infrared, extending into visible, ultraviolet, and even X-ray regions (e.g. the solar corona). Thus, the popular association of infrared radiation with thermal radiation is only a coincidence based on typical (comparatively low) temperatures often found near the surface of planet Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe concept of emissivity is important in understanding the infrared emissions of objects. This is a property of a surface that describes how its thermal emissions deviate from the ideal of a black body. To further explain, two objects at the same physical temperature will not show the same infrared image if they have differing emissivity. For example, for any pre-set emissivity value, objects with higher emissivity will appear hotter, and those with a lower emissivity will appear cooler. For that reason, incorrect selection of emissivity will give inaccurate results when using infrared cameras and pyrometers.\\r\\n\\r\\n Infrared is used in night vision equipment when there is insufficient visible light to see.[23] Night vision devices operate through a process involving the conversion of ambient light photons into electrons that are then amplified by a chemical and electrical process and then converted back into visible light.[23] Infrared light sources can be used to augment the available ambient light for conversion by night vision devices, increasing in-the-dark visibility without actually using a visible light source.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of infrared light and night vision devices should not be confused with thermal imaging, which creates images based on differences in surface temperature by detecting infrared radiation (heat) that emanates from objects and their surrounding environment.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation can be used to remotely determine the temperature of objects (if the emissivity is known). This is termed thermography, or in the case of very hot objects in the NIR or visible it is termed pyrometry. Thermography (thermal imaging) is mainly used in military and industrial applications but the technology is reaching the public market in the form of infrared cameras on cars due to the massively reduced production costs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThermographic cameras detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 900ÿ14,000 nanometers or 0.9ÿ14?m) and produce images of that radiation. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects based on their temperatures, according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to \\"see\\" one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature, therefore thermography allows one to see variations in temperature (hence the name).\\r\\n\\r\\nA hyperspectral image is a \\"picture\\" containing continuous spectrum through a wide spectral range at each pixel. Hyperspectral imaging is gaining importance in the field of applied spectroscopy particularly with NIR, SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR spectral regions. Typical applications include biological, mineralogical, defence, and industrial measurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThermal infrared hyperspectral imaging can be similarly performed using a Thermographic camera, with the fundamental difference that each pixel contains a full LWIR spectrum. Consequently, chemical identification of the object can be performed without a need for an external light source such as the sun or the moon. Such cameras are typically applied for geological measurements, outdoor surveillance and UAV applications.[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn infrared photography, infrared filters are used to capture the near-infrared spectrum. Digital cameras often use infrared blockers. Cheaper digital cameras and camera phones have less effective filters and can \\"see\\" intense near-infrared, appearing as a bright purple-white color. This is especially pronounced when taking pictures of subjects near IR-bright areas (such as near a lamp), where the resulting infrared interference can wash out the image. There is also a technique called 'T-ray' imaging, which is imaging using far-infrared or terahertz radiation. Lack of bright sources can make terahertz photography more challenging than most other infrared imaging techniques. Recently T-ray imaging has been of considerable interest due to a number of new developments such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared tracking, also known as infrared homing, refers to a passive missile guidance system, which uses the emission from a target of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared part of the spectrum to track it. Missiles that use infrared seeking are often referred to as \\"heat-seekers\\", since infrared (IR) is just below the visible spectrum of light in frequency and is radiated strongly by hot bodies. Many objects such as people, vehicle engines, and aircraft generate and retain heat, and as such, are especially visible in the infrared wavelengths of light compared to objects in the background.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared radiation can be used as a deliberate heating source. For example, it is used in infrared saunas to heat the occupants. It may also be used in other heating applications, such as to remove ice from the wings of aircraft (de-icing).[28] Infrared can be used in cooking and heating food as it predominantly heats the opaque, absorbent objects, rather than the air around them.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared heating is also becoming more popular in industrial manufacturing processes, e.g. curing of coatings, forming of plastics, annealing, plastic welding, and print drying. In these applications, infrared heaters replace convection ovens and contact heating.\\r\\n\\r\\nEfficiency is achieved by matching the wavelength of the infrared heater to the absorption characteristics of the material.\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of technologies or proposed technologies take advantage of infrared emissions to cool buildings or other systems. The LWIR (8ÿ15?m) region is especially useful since some radiation at these wavelengths can escape into space through the atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIR data transmission is also employed in short-range communication among computer peripherals and personal digital assistants. These devices usually conform to standards published by IrDA, the Infrared Data Association. Remote controls and IrDA devices use infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to emit infrared radiation that is focused by a plastic lens into a narrow beam. The beam is modulated, i.e. switched on and off, to prevent interference from other sources of infrared (like sunlight or artificial lighting). The receiver uses a silicon photodiode to convert the infrared radiation to an electric current. It responds only to the rapidly pulsing signal created by the transmitter, and filters out slowly changing infrared radiation from ambient light. Infrared communications are useful for indoor use in areas of high population density. IR does not penetrate walls and so does not interfere with other devices in adjoining rooms. Infrared is the most common way for remote controls to command appliances.\\r\\nInfrared remote control protocols like RC-5, SIRC, are used to communicate with infrared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFree space optical communication using infrared lasers can be a relatively inexpensive way to install a communications link in an urban area operating at up to 4 gigabit/s, compared to the cost of burying fiber optic cable, except for the radiation damage. \\"Since the eye cannot detect IR, blinking or closing the eyes to help prevent or reduce damage may not happen.\\"[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared lasers are used to provide the light for optical fiber communications systems. Infrared light with a wavelength around 1,330?nm (least dispersion) or 1,550?nm (best transmission) are the best choices for standard silica fibers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIR data transmission of encoded audio versions of printed signs is being researched as an aid for visually impaired people through the RIAS (Remote Infrared Audible Signage) project.\\r\\nTransmitting IR data from one device to another is sometimes referred to as beaming.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared vibrational spectroscopy (see also near-infrared spectroscopy) is a technique that can be used to identify molecules by analysis of their constituent bonds. Each chemical bond in a molecule vibrates at a frequency characteristic of that bond. A group of atoms in a molecule (e.g., CH2) may have multiple modes of oscillation caused by the stretching and bending motions of the group as a whole. If an oscillation leads to a change in dipole in the molecule then it will absorb a photon that has the same frequency. The vibrational frequencies of most molecules correspond to the frequencies of infrared light. Typically, the technique is used to study organic compounds using light radiation from 4000ÿ400?cm?1, the mid-infrared. A spectrum of all the frequencies of absorption in a sample is recorded. This can be used to gain information about the sample composition in terms of chemical groups present and also its purity (for example, a wet sample will show a broad O-H absorption around 3200?cm?1).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the semiconductor industry, infrared light can be used to characterize materials such as thin films and periodic trench structures. By measuring the reflectance of light from the surface of a semiconductor wafer, the index of refraction (n) and the extinction Coefficient (k) can be determined via the Forouhi-Bloomer dispersion equations. The reflectance from the infrared light can also be used to determine the critical dimension, depth, and sidewall angle of high aspect ratio trench structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeather satellites equipped with scanning radiometers produce thermal or infrared images, which can then enable a trained analyst to determine cloud heights and types, to calculate land and surface water temperatures, and to locate ocean surface features. The scanning is typically in the range 10.3ÿ12.5?m (IR4 and IR5 channels).\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh, cold ice clouds such as Cirrus or Cumulonimbus show up bright white, lower warmer clouds such as Stratus or Stratocumulus show up as grey with intermediate clouds shaded accordingly. Hot land surfaces will show up as dark-grey or black. One disadvantage of infrared imagery is that low cloud such as stratus or fog can be a similar temperature to the surrounding land or sea surface and does not show up. However, using the difference in brightness of the IR4 channel (10.3ÿ11.5?m) and the near-infrared channel (1.58ÿ1.64?m), low cloud can be distinguished, producing a fog satellite picture. The main advantage of infrared is that images can be produced at night, allowing a continuous sequence of weather to be studied.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese infrared pictures can depict ocean eddies or vortices and map currents such as the Gulf Stream, which are valuable to the shipping industry. Fishermen and farmers are interested in knowing land and water temperatures to protect their crops against frost or increase their catch from the sea. Even El Ni?o phenomena can be spotted. Using color-digitized techniques, the gray-shaded thermal images can be converted to color for easier identification of desired information.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main water vapour channel at 6.40 to 7.08?m can be imaged by some weather satellites and shows the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the field of climatology, atmospheric infrared radiation is monitored to detect trends in the energy exchange between the earth and the atmosphere. These trends provide information on long-term changes in Earth's climate. It is one of the primary parameters studied in research into global warming, together with solar radiation.\\r\\n\\r\\nA pyrgeometer is utilized in this field of research to perform continuous outdoor measurements. This is a broadband infrared radiometer with sensitivity for infrared radiation between approximately 4.5?m and 50?m.\\r\\n\\r\\nAstronomers observe objects in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum using optical components, including mirrors, lenses and solid state digital detectors. For this reason it is classified as part of optical astronomy. To form an image, the components of an infrared telescope need to be carefully shielded from heat sources, and the detectors are chilled using liquid helium.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sensitivity of Earth-based infrared telescopes is significantly limited by water vapor in the atmosphere, which absorbs a portion of the infrared radiation arriving from space outside of selected atmospheric windows. This limitation can be partially alleviated by placing the telescope observatory at a high altitude, or by carrying the telescope aloft with a balloon or an aircraft. Space telescopes do not suffer from this handicap, and so outer space is considered the ideal location for infrared astronomy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infrared portion of the spectrum has several useful benefits for astronomers. Cold, dark molecular clouds of gas and dust in our galaxy will glow with radiated heat as they are irradiated by imbedded stars. Infrared can also be used to detect protostars before they begin to emit visible light. Stars emit a smaller portion of their energy in the infrared spectrum, so nearby cool objects such as planets can be more readily detected. (In the visible light spectrum, the glare from the star will drown out the reflected light from a planet.)\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared light is also useful for observing the cores of active galaxies, which are often cloaked in gas and dust. Distant galaxies with a high redshift will have the peak portion of their spectrum shifted toward longer wavelengths, so they are more readily observed in the infrared.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared cleaning is a technique used by some motion picture film scanners, film scanners and flatbed scanners to reduce or remove the effect of dust and scratches upon the finished scan. It works by collecting an additional infrared channel from the scan at the same position and resolution as the three visible color channels (red, green, and blue). The infrared channel, in combination with the other channels, is used to detect the location of scratches and dust. Once located, those defects can be corrected by scaling or replaced by inpainting.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nInfrared reflectography?(fr; it; es), as called by art conservators,[31] can be applied to paintings to reveal underlying layers in a completely non-destructive manner, in particular the underdrawing or outline drawn by the artist as a guide. This often reveals the artist's use of carbon black, which shows up well in reflectograms, as long as it has not also been used in the ground underlying the whole painting. Art conservators are looking to see whether the visible layers of paint differ from the underdrawing or layers in between ÿ such alterations are called pentimenti when made by the original artist. This is very useful information in deciding whether a painting is the prime version by the original artist or a copy, and whether it has been altered by over-enthusiastic restoration work. In general, the more pentimenti the more likely a painting is to be the prime version. It also gives useful insights into working practices.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong many other changes in the Arnolfini Portrait of 1434 (left), the man's face was originally higher by about the height of his eye; the woman's was higher, and her eyes looked more to the front. Each of his feet was underdrawn in one position, painted in another, and then overpainted in a third. These alterations are seen in infrared reflectograms.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent progress in the design of infrared sensitive cameras made it possible to discover and depict not only underpaintings and pentimenti but entire paintings which were later overpainted by the artist.[34] Notable examples are Picasso's \\"Woman ironing\\" and \\"Blue room\\", where in both cases, a portrait of a man has been made visible under the painting as it is known today.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar uses of infrared are made by conservators and scientists on various types of objects, especially very old written documents such as the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Roman works in the Villa of the Papyri, and the Silk Road texts found in the Dunhuang Caves.[35] Carbon black used in ink can show up extremely well.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pit viper has a pair of infrared sensory pits on its head. There is uncertainty regarding the exact thermal sensitivity of this biological infrared detection system.[36][37]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther organisms that have thermoreceptive organs are pythons (family Pythonidae), some boas (family Boidae), the Common Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus), a variety of jewel beetles (Melanophila acuminata),[38] darkly pigmented butterflies (Pachliopta aristolochiae and Troides rhadamantus plateni), and possibly blood-sucking bugs (Triatoma infestans).[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome fungi like Venturia inaequalis require near-infrared light for ejection[40]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough near-infrared vision (780ÿ1000?nm) has long been deemed impossible due to noise in visual pigments,[41] sensation of near-infrared light was reported in the common carp and in three cichlid species.[41][42][43][44][45] Fish use NIR to capture prey[41] and for phototactic swimming orientation.[45] NIR sensation in fish may be relevant under poor lighting conditions during twilight[41] and in turbid surface waters.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nNear-infrared light, or photobiomodulation, is used for treatment of chemotherapy-induced oral ulceration as well as wound healing. There is some work relating to anti-herpes virus treatment.[46] Research projects include work on central nervous system healing effects via cytochrome c oxidase upregulation and other possible mechanisms.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nStrong infrared radiation in certain industry high-heat settings may be hazardous to the eyes, resulting in damage or blindness to the user. Since the radiation is invisible, special IR-proof goggles must be worn in such places.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared, beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer. He was surprised at the result and called them \\"Calorific Rays\\".[49][50] The term 'Infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nOther important dates include:[17]","input":"Who discovered infrared waves in the electromagnetic spectrum?"},{"output":"about 55%","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood plasma is a yellowish coloured liquid component of blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension; this makes plasma the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume.[1] It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (6ÿ8%) (i.e.serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen),[2] glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3?, Cl?, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and oxygen.\\r\\nPlasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolyte concentration balanced and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood plasma is separated from the blood by spinning a tube of fresh blood containing an anticoagulant in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off.[4] Blood plasma has a density of approximately 1025?kg/m3, or 1.025?g/ml.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood serum is blood plasma without clotting factors.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasmapheresis is a medical therapy that involves blood plasma extraction, treatment, and reintegration.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh frozen plasma is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[6] It is of critical importance in the treatment of many types of trauma which result in blood loss, and is therefore kept stocked universally in  all medical facilities capable of treating trauma (ex. trauma centers, hospitals, and ambulances) or that pose a risk of patient blood loss such as surgical suite facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood plasma volume may be expanded by or drained to extravascular fluid when there are changes in Starling forces across capillary walls. For example, when blood pressure drops in circulatory shock, Starling forces drive fluid into the interstitium, causing third spacing.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding still for a prolonged period will cause an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. As a result, approximately 12% of blood plasma volume will cross into the extravascular compartment. This causes an increase in hematocrit, serum total protein, blood viscosity and, as a result of increased concentration of coagulation factors, it causes orthostatic hypercoagulability.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \\"Dried plasmas\\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and whole blood were used. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Blood for Britain\\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on Charles Drew's contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \\"Plasma for Britain\\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the test tube methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.[8] The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.[9] \\r\\nThe Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the \\"Plasma for Britain\\" invention, Drew was named director of the Red Cross blood bank and assistant director of the National Research Council, in charge of blood collection for the United States Army and Navy. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the race of the donor. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for \\"same race\\" blood.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war the American Red Cross had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. Serum albumin replaced dried plasma for combat use during the Korean War.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nPlasma as a blood product prepared from blood donations is used in blood transfusions, typically as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24).  When donating whole blood or packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, O- is the most desirable and is considered a \\"universal donor,\\" since it has neither A nor B antigens and can be safely transfused to most recipients.  Type AB+ is the \\"universal recipient\\" type for PRBC donations.  However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through apheresis, as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens.  As such, AB is often considered the \\"universal donor\\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.[13] However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing fears of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began to import American plasma to meet its needs. In 2002, it purchased Life Resources Incorporated to be able to secure plasma supply from the United States.[15] The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK).  It owned Bio Products Laboratory. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth S230?million.[16] The sale was met with criticism in the UK, over both the oversight of the company, and the impact on British blood needs. Confusion arose as some thought that the blood of British blood donors voluntarily donating to NHS Blood and Transplant Services would be sold for profit.[17] Currently, plasma donated in the United Kingdom is still not used due to concerns about vCJD, and is incinerated after component parts have been separated from it.[17][18]\\r\\n\\r\\nSimulated body fluid (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma. SBF is normally used for the surface modification of metallic implants, and more recently in gene delivery application.","input":"What percentage of blood is made up of plasma?"},{"output":"Emperor Ai of Tang","context":"","input":"Who was the last ruler of the tang dynasty?"},{"output":"Crook Brothers","context":"The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \\"barn dance\\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.[1][2] Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.[3] It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners.\\r\\nThe Opry's current primary slogan is \\"The Show that Made Country Music Famous\\".[4] Other slogans include \\"Home of American Music\\" and \\"Countrys Most Famous Stage\\".[3]\\r\\nIn the 1930s the show began hiring professionals and expanded to four hours; and WSM, broadcasting by then with 50,000 watts, made the program a Saturday night musical tradition in nearly 30 states.[5] In 1939, it debuted nationally on NBC Radio. The Opry moved to a permanent home, the Ryman Auditorium, in 1943. As it developed in importance, so did the city of Nashville, which became America's \\"country music capital\\".[6] The Grand Ole Opry holds such significance in Nashville that its name is included on the city/county line signs on all major roadways. The signs read \\"Music City|Metropolitan Nashville Davidson County|Home of the Grand Ole Opry\\".\\r\\nMembership in the Opry remains one of country music's crowning achievements.[7] Such country music legends as Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Patsy Cline, Marty Robbins, Roy Acuff, the Carter family, Bill Monroe, Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells and Minnie Pearl became regulars on the Opry's stage. In recent decades, the Opry has hosted such contemporary country stars as Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Alan Jackson, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, Josh Turner, Carrie Underwood, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Dierks Bentley, Little Big Town, Blake Shelton, Chris Young and Ricky Skaggs. Since 1974, the show has been broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House east of downtown Nashville, with an annual three-month winter foray back to the Ryman since 1999. Performances have been sporadically televised in addition to the radio programs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry started as the WSM Barn Dance in the new fifth-floor radio studio of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company in downtown Nashville on November 28, 1925. On October 18, 1925, management began a program featuring \\"Dr. Humphrey Bate and his string quartet of old-time musicians.\\" On November 2, WSM hired long-time announcer and program director George D. \\"Judge\\" Hay, an enterprising pioneer from the National Barn Dance program at WLS in Chicago, who was also named the most popular radio announcer in America as a result of his radio work with both WLS and WMC in Memphis, Tennessee. Hay launched the WSM Barn Dance with 77-year-old fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson on November 28, 1925, which is celebrated as the birth date of the Grand Ole Opry.[8]\\r\\nSome of the bands regularly on the show during its early days included Bill Monroe, the Possum Hunters (with Dr. Humphrey Bate), the Fruit Jar Drinkers with Uncle Dave Macon, the Crook Brothers, the Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers, Sid Harkreader, Deford Bailey, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, and the Gully Jumpers.[9]\\r\\nJudge Hay, however, liked the Fruit Jar Drinkers and asked them to appear last on each show because he wanted to always close each segment with \\"red hot fiddle playing\\". They were the second band accepted on Barn Dance, with the Crook Brothers being the first. When the Opry began having square dancers on the show, the Fruit Jar Drinkers always played for them. In 1926, Uncle Dave Macon, a Tennessee banjo player who had recorded several songs and toured the vaudeville circuit, became its first real star.[9]\\r\\nThe phrase \\"Grand Ole Opry\\" was first uttered on the air on December 10, 1927.[10] At the time, Barn Dance followed the NBC Red Network's Music Appreciation Hour, a program of classical music and selections from grand opera presented by classical conductor Walter Damrosch. On that particular night, Damrosch had remarked that \\"there is no place in the classics for realism.\\" In response, Opry presenter George Hay said:\\r\\nFriends, the program which just came to a close was devoted to the classics. Doctor Damrosch told us that there is no place in the classics for realism. However, from here on out for the next three hours, we will present nothing but realism. It will be down to earth for the \\"earthy\\".\\r\\nHay then introduced DeFord Bailey, the man he had dubbed the \\"Harmonica Wizard\\", saying:\\r\\nFor the past hour, we have been listening to music taken largely from Grand Opera. From now on, we will present the \\"Grand Ole Opry\\".\\r\\nBailey then stepped up to the mic to play \\"The Pan-American Blues,\\" his song inspired by the Pan-American, a premier L&N Railroad passenger train.[10][11]\\r\\nAs audiences for the live show increased, National Life & Accident Insurance's radio venue became too small to accommodate the hordes of fans. They built a larger studio, but it was still not large enough. After several months with no audiences, National Life decided to allow the show to move outside its home offices. In October 1934, the Opry moved into then-suburban Hillsboro Theatre (now the Belcourt); and then on June 13, 1936, to the Dixie Tabernacle in East Nashville. The Opry then moved to the War Memorial Auditorium, a downtown venue adjacent to the State Capitol. A 25-cent admission was charged to try to curb the large crowds, but to no avail. On June 5, 1943, the Opry moved to the Ryman Auditorium.\\r\\nTop-charting country music acts performed during the Ryman years, including Roy Acuff, called the King of Country Music, Hank Williams, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, Martha Carson, Lefty Frizzell, and many others.\\r\\nOne hour of the Opry was nationally-broadcast by the NBC Red Network from 1939 to 1956; for much of its run, it aired one hour after the program that had inspired it, National Barn Dance. The NBC segment, originally known by the name of its sponsor, The Prince Albert Show, was first hosted by Acuff, who was succeeded by Red Foley from 1946 to 1954. From October 15, 1955 to September 1956, ABC-TV aired a live, hour-long television version once a month on Saturday nights (sponsored by Ralston-Purina), pre-empting one hour of the then-90-minute Ozark Jubilee. From 1955 to 1957, Al Gannaway owned and produced both The Country Show and Stars of the Grand Ole Opry, filmed programs syndicated by Flamingo Films. Gannaway's Stars of the Grand Ole Opry was the first television show shot in color.[12]\\r\\nOn October 2, 1954, a teenage Elvis Presley made his only Opry performance. Although the audience reacted politely to his revolutionary brand of rockabilly music, after the show Opry manager Jim Denny told Presley's producer Sam Phillips that the singer's style did not suit the program.[13]\\r\\nIn the 1960s, as the hippie counterculture movement spread, the Opry maintained a strait-laced, conservative image with \\"longhairs\\" not being featured on the show. The Byrds were a notable exception. Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, who at that time was a member of The Byrds, was in Nashville to work on the band's country rock album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo.[14] The band's record label, Columbia Records, had arranged for The Byrds to be allowed to perform at the Ryman on March 15, 1968, a prospect that thrilled Parsons.[14] However, when the band took the stage the audience's response was immediately hostile, resulting in derisive heckling, booing and mocking calls of \\"tweet, tweet\\" and \\"cut your hair\\"[15][16] The Byrds further outraged the Opry establishment by breaking with accepted protocol when they performed Parsons' song \\"Hickory Wind\\" instead of the Merle Haggard song \\"Life in Prison\\", as had been announced by Tompall Glaser.[14]\\r\\nAnother artist that ran afoul of the Opry's stringent standards was Jerry Lee Lewis, who, after several years of success on the country charts, made his first and only appearance on the show on January 20, 1973. Given two conditions for his appearance (no rock and roll and no profanity), Lewis proceeded to disregard both (referring to himself as a certain unairable maternal insult at one point) and, in a continuous 40-minute set, played a mixture of his rock and roll hits and covers of other singers' country songs. Lewis was said to be bitter about how he was treated when he first arrived in Nashville in 1955 and supposedly used his Opry appearance to exact revenge on the Nashville music industry.[17]\\r\\nThe Ryman Auditorium was home to the Opry until 1974. By the late 1960s, National Life & Accident desired a new, larger and more modern home for the long-running radio show. Ryman Auditorium, already 51 years old at the time the Opry moved there, was beginning to suffer from disrepair as the downtown neighborhood around it fell victim to increasing urban decay. Despite these shortcomings, the show's popularity was increasing and its weekly crowds were outgrowing the 3,000-seat venue. The Opry's operators were seeking to build a new air-conditioned theatre with a greater capacity, ample parking, and the ability to easily serve as a television production facility. The ideal location would be in a less urbanized area of town, providing visitors a more controlled, safer, and more enjoyable experience.[20]\\r\\nNational Life & Accident purchased farmland owned by a local sausage manufacturer (Rudy's Farm) in the Pennington Bend area of Nashville, nine miles east of downtown, and adjacent to the newly constructed Briley Parkway. The new Opry venue was to be the centerpiece of a grand entertainment complex at that location, which would later come to include Opryland USA Theme Park and Opryland Hotel.\\r\\nThe theme park opened to the public on June 30, 1972,[21] well ahead of the 4,000-seat Opry House, which debuted nearly two years later, on Saturday, March 16, 1974.\\r\\nOpening night was attended by sitting U.S. President Richard Nixon, who played a few songs on the piano.[22] To carry on the tradition of the show's run at the Ryman, a six-foot circle of oak was cut from the corner of the Ryman's stage and inlaid into center stage at the new venue.[23] The artists on stage usually stand on the circle as they perform.\\r\\nWhile the theme park was closed and demolished following the 1997 season, the Grand Ole Opry House remains in use. The immediate area around it was left intact through the construction of Opry Mills, which opened in May 2000.\\r\\nThe Opry continues to be performed every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday at the Grand Ole Opry House from March through November each year.\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry House was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 2015.[24][25]\\r\\nFollowing the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building still held such significance as an attraction that it would remain open for tours.[26]\\r\\nIn 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled At the Ryman. The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment undertook a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it into a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion on June 4, 1994.[26]\\r\\nOn Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974.[27] The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and so the decision was made to host the Opry's regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999 as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.\\r\\nBeginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism.[27] While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the Opry was away. It was replaced by Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical beginning in 2015.[28]\\r\\nIn May 2010, the Opry House was flooded, along with much of Nashville, due to the Cumberland River overflowing its banks. While repairs were made, the Opry itself remained uninterrupted. Over the course of the summer of 2010, the broadcast temporarily originated from alternate venues in Nashville, with Ryman Auditorium hosting the majority of the shows. Other venues included the TPAC War Memorial Auditorium, another former Opry home; TPAC's Andrew Jackson Hall; Nashville Municipal Auditorium; Allen Arena at Lipscomb University; and the Two Rivers Baptist Church.[29]\\r\\nMuch of the auditorium's main floor seating, the backstage areas and the entire stage (including the inlaid circle of wood from the Ryman's stage) was underwater during the flood. While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced thereafter, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at center stage in the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed.[30][31] The remediation following the flood also resulted in a renovated backstage area, including the construction of more dressing rooms and a performer's lounge.\\r\\nThe Opry returned to the Grand Ole Opry House on September 28, 2010 in a special edition of the Opry entitled Country Comes Home that was televised live on Great American Country. The evening was filled with one-of-a-kind Opry moments. Martina McBride and Connie Smith dueted on Smith's signature hit \\"Once a Day\\", and other collaborations included Dierks Bentley and Del McCoury (\\"Roll On Buddy, Roll On\\"), Josh Turner and Lorrie Morgan (\\"Golden Ring\\"), and Montgomery Gentry and Charlie Daniels Band (\\"Devil Went Down To Georgia\\"), among others. The show closed with an all-star guitar jam featuring Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Steve Wariner, Ricky Skaggs, and Marty Stuart.[32]\\r\\nThe Grand Ole Opry is broadcast live on WSM-AM at 7 p.m. CT on Saturday nights, shortened from a previous time start of 6:30. A similar program, the Friday Night Opry, airs live on Friday nights.From February through December, the Tuesday Night Opry is also aired live.[33] Wednesday shows are typically presented in the summer months. The length of the show varies; as of October 2016, the show runs three nights a week for 2? hours each night (the Saturday night shows have often extended as late as midnight).\\r\\nThe Opry can also be heard live on Willie's Roadhouse on channel 59 on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. A condensed radio program, America's Opry Weekend, is syndicated to stations around the United States. The program is also streamed on WSM's website.[33]\\r\\nABC broadcast the Grand Old Opry as a monthly series from 1955 to 1956. PBS televised annual live performances from 1978 to 1981.[34] In 1985, The Nashville Network began airing an edited half-hour version of the program as Grand Ole Opry Live; the show moved to Country Music Television (expanding to an hour in the process), and then to the Great American Country (GAC) cable network[35] with its Opry Live show no longer televised.[36] RFD-TV carries reruns of Opry telecasts under the title Opry Encore.[37]\\r\\nRegular performers at the Grand Ole Opry can be inducted into the organization as a member, by way of an existing member nominating them. Opry membership must be maintained throughout an artist's career and expires when the performer dies. Although a number of legendary country artists either lost their Opry membership (such as Hank Williams, Sr. and Willie Nelson) or never received it in their lifetimes (longtime leading hitmakers Merle Haggard, George Strait, and Conway Twitty being prominent examples), receiving Opry membership is considered an honor equivalent to a hall of fame induction.\\r\\nIn April 1963 Opry management made a rule that members had to perform on at least 26 shows a year to keep their membership active.[38] WSM dropped the number of required performances to 20 in January 1964;[38] in 2000 the minimum number of Opry performances was at 12.[39] The minimum number of performances has reduced over the years, but artists offered membership are expected to show a dedication to the Opry with frequent attendance.[39]\\r\\nAnother controversy that raged for years was over allowable instrumentation, especially the use of drums and electrically amplified instruments. Some purists were appalled at the prospect; traditionally a string bass provided the rhythm component in country music and percussion instruments were seldom used. Electric amplification, then new, was regarded as the province of popular music and jazz in 1940s. Though the Opry allowed electric guitars and steel guitars by World War II, the restrictions against drums and horns continued. They caused a conflict when Bob Wills[40] and Pee Wee King[41] defied the show's ban on drums.\\r\\nThe company has enforced its trademark on the name \\"Grand Ole Opry\\", for which it owns trademark registrations in the United States and in numerous countries around the world.It has taken court action to limit use of the word \\"opry\\" (which the organization has not directly trademarked) to members of the Opry and products associated with or licensed by it, and to discourage use of the word in ways that would imply a connection to the Grand Ole Opry.[42] In late 1968, for instance, WSM sued Opry Records, a record label that was independent of WSM,[43] and the court stated that \\"the record is replete with newspaper and magazine articles and clippings which demonstrate conclusively that the term 'Opry', standing alone as defendant has used it, is constantly used in country and western music circles in referring to plaintiff's 'Grand Ole Opry'.\\"[44] The court also stated \\"the defendant has appropriated, at its peril, the dominant or salient term in the plaintiff's mark, a term which identified the 'Grand Ole Opry' in the mind of the public many years before the inception of 'Opry Records' ÿ the name adopted by defendant.\\"[45] In another case, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted summary judgment that the term \\"Opry\\" is a generic term (and thus no more protected than the words \\"Grand\\" or \\"Ole\\") but the Federal Circuit court reversed this decision.[46] As recently as 2009, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted judgment against Texas Opry House, LLC, which had filed a trademark application for TEXAS OPRY HOUSE.[47]\\r\\nIn 2004, it was announced that the Grand Ole Opry had contracted for the first time with a \\"presenting sponsor\\", Cracker Barrel, and the sponsoring company's name would be associated with Grand Ole Opry in all its advertising.[48] Humana, Inc., Cracker Barrel, and Dollar General are the present sponsors of the Opry.[49]","input":"Who was the first member of the grand ole opry?"},{"output":"William DeWitt, Jr.","context":"The St. Louis Cardinals, a professional baseball franchise based in St. Louis, Missouri, compete in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). An investment group consisting of William DeWitt, Jr., Fred Hanser, the Klingaman Group, and others, owns the St. Louis Cardinals, who bought the team from Anheuser-Busch (AB) in 1996.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChris von der Ahe was the first owner of the Cardinals franchise, then known as the Brown Stockings and pioneered many of the elements commonly associated with the sport at the game. A German immigrant who made his way as a grocer and saloon owner, he saw potential in the sport without otherwise having any other background in it.[2] He also became a polarizing figure with his employees and rivals: Von der Ahe was a flamboyant and magnanimous entrepreneur who gained enormous popularity in St. Louis and his team but was reviled by rival owners. He was marked by a willingness to charge lower admission rates, encouraging play on Sundays, and opening beer concessions at the stadium, a practice that the National League prohibited during Von der Ahe's time. He also was one of the few owners to make a profit during his time, in contrast with his rival owners, whose American Association eventually collapsed due to bankruptcy. [3] National League owners such Albert Spalding bristled at his promotional techniques that became common to today's game. Charlie O. Finley, Larry McPhail, and Bill Veeck eventually employed sideshow attractions, like the \\"stadium club\\" and the shoot-the-chute.[4]\\r\\nIn 1881, after the Browns profited $25,000 from playing a season's worth of informal contests, Von der Ahe bought out the team's remaining stockholders for $1,800.[5] With baseball's already existing popularity in Cincinnati and increasing popularity in other cities such as Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Baltimore, the time was right for a new league. Late that same year, along with other owners and financiers, Von der Ahe formed the American Association of Base Ball Clubs with the Brown Stockings.[6] In 1899, von der Ahe, once the most successful owner in the AA, was forced to sell the Browns due to bankruptcy.[3]\\r\\nFirst making his mark as a local automobile dealer, Sam Breadon first purchased a minority stake in the Cardinals in 1917 for $2,000, thus commencing 30 total years as owner of the Cardinals. Three years later, Breadon bought out the majority stock in the club to become the principal owner of the Cardinals and extinguished the futility that dredged the Cardinals' first three decades in the National League. Between 1926 and 1946, the Cardinals won six World Series titles and nine National League pennants.\\r\\nBreadon was noted for a very conservative nature with his finances, highly demanding nature of his teams' success on the field, and bold moves otherwise. When he became minority owner, the Cardinals were $150,000 in debt.[7] In 1925, he moved Branch Rickey from the dugout to the front office and promoted second baseman Rogers Hornsby to player-manager. Breadon also convinced cross-town American League rival St. Louis Browns owner Phil Ball to allow the Cardinals to move into Sportsman's Park. This allowed him to sell the dilapidated Robison Field property for a total of $275,000 to the city and a trolley company, clear their debts, and, with Rickey's oversight, establish an official, contractually-linked minor league farm system. This strategy developed into the current minor league system and the Cardinals used it to circumvent the practice of bidding against the more affluent Major League teams such as the New York Yankees and New York Giants for players from minor league teams, which at that time were unaffiliated. Although Minor League Baseball has existed as long as baseball has been organized, it was the first player development system of its kind in any professional sport.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1920 and 1947, the Cardinals compiled a record of 2,470-1,830 for a winning percentage of .574.[9] When he sold the Cardinals to Fred Saigh and Robert Hannegan in 1947, the price was $3 million, at the time the largest transaction in baseball history.[7][10]\\r\\nAt the end of the 1947 baseball season, Saigh got wind that longtime Cardinals owner Sam Breadon wanted to sell. Breadon faced two problems. He was ill with prostate cancer, and he had been unable to find land on which to build a planned new ballpark. The Cardinals had rented Sportsman's Park from the city's other major league team, the American League Browns, since 1920. Although they had long since surpassed the Browns as the city's most popular team, Breadon wanted to build a park of his own. He had set aside $5 million to build a park, and was facing the end of a five-year deadline to build it before having to pay taxes on that money. Saigh persuaded Breadon to sell the Cardinals to him, with the assurance that he wouldn't have to pay taxes on his $5 million fund. To further put him at ease, Saigh brought in Robert Hannegan as a minority partner. Hannegan was a prominent St. Louis businessman, former United States Postmaster General, and confidante of President Harry Truman. The $4 million deal closed in late 1947.\\r\\nSaigh inherited a team in transition. The Cardinals, though then just one year removed from their ninth National League pennant and sixth World Series championship since 1926, had begun to decay as an organization. Five years before, Breadon had forced out legendary general manager Branch Rickey, who had quickly resurfaced with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Meanwhile, the Browns, under new owner Bill Veeck, began a concerted effort to drive the Cardinals out of town.[11]\\r\\nIn January, 1949, Hannegan, suffering from poor health, his share o[12] f the team to Saigh. Hannegan died that October of heart disease. As sole owner, Saigh's notable actions included leading other baseball owners to oust (by not renewing his contract) Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler in December, 1950 [13] and proposing revenue-sharing of local television revenues.[14]\\r\\nHowever, the tax dodge Saigh used soon came to light, as well as other questionable practices on his part.[11] Saigh was indicted on federal charges of evading $49,260 in income taxes between 1946 and 1949. In January 1953, he pleaded no contest to two counts involving more than $19,000 in tax underpayments, and was sentenced to 15 months in prison.[15] He served five months at the federal penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, leaving in November 1953 when he was given parole for good behavior.\\r\\nIn February 1953, under pressure from Commissioner Ford Frick, Saigh put the Cardinals up for sale.[15] Saigh would have almost certainly been thrown out of baseball if he hadn't sold the team. For a time, no credible offers surfaced from St. Louis interests, making it seem likely that the team would be purchased by someone interested in moving them to another city. The most promising offer came from a consortium of businessmen in Houston, Texas. The Cardinals owned the Houston Buffaloes of the Texas League; under major-league rules of the time, that meant they also held the major-league rights to Houston. The only question was whether Buffalo Stadium could be upgraded to major-league standards.[16]\\r\\nHowever, just before he was due to reach a final agreement with the Houston group, Saigh sold the Cardinals to Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based brewery. Although Anheuser-Busch's offer was far less ($3.75 million) than what out-of-town suitors had on the table, Anheuser-Busch president Gussie Busch persuaded Saigh that civic pride was more important than money. This all but assured that the Cardinals would stay in St. Louis. Shortly afterward, the Cardinals bought Sportsman's Park from the Browns. With their remaining leverage gone, it was the Browns who left town by the end of the season, becoming the Baltimore Orioles.)\\r\\nAs with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a \\"small market\\", which appear to handicap a club's competitiveness. Such was the case when Sam Breadon sold the Cardinals in 1947: then-NL President Ford Frick had proposed to Breadon the idea of moving the Cardinals to Chicago.[17] When AB placed the Cardinals for sale in 1995, they publicly expressed intention to find a buyer who would keep the club in St. Louis.[18] In March 1996, AB sold the team for $147 million to a partnership headed by Southwest Bank's Drew Baur, Hanser and DeWitt, Jr.[17] Civic Center Redevelopment, a subsidiary of AB, held the parking garages and adjacent property and also transferred them to the Baur ownership group.[19] Baur's group then sold the garages to another investment group, making the net cost of the franchise purchase about $100 million, making the net purchase price about $10 million less than Financial World's value of the team at the time $110 million.[18][20]\\r\\nCurrent Cincinnati Reds owner Bob Castellini and brothers Thomas Williams and W. Joseph Williams Jr. each once owned a stake in the Cardinals dating back to the Baur-DeWitt group's purchase of the team. To allow their purchase of the Reds in 2005, the rest of the group bought out Castellini's and the Williams brothers' shares, totaling an estimated 13%. At that time, the Forbes valued the Cardinals at about $370 million.[21] However, after reabsorbing that stake into the remainder of the group, they decided to make it available to new investors in 2010. Amid later allegations that the Cardinals owed the city profit shares, DeWitt revealed that their profitability had not reached the threshold to trigger that obligation.[22]\\r\\nAs of 2013, according to Forbes, the Cardinals are the tenth-most valuable franchise of 30 in MLB at $716.2 million, with a revenue of $239 million. They play \\"in the best single-team baseball market in the country and are among the league's leaders in television ratings and attendance every season.\\"[23] Concurrent with the growth of Major League Baseball, the Cardinals value has increased significantly since the Baur-DeWitt purchase. In 2000, the franchise was valued at $219 million,[24] a growth rate of 327%. Since 2012, the franchise's value grew 21%.\\r\\nValuation per Forbes.\\r\\n1 Based on current stadium deal (unless new stadium is pending) without deduction for debt, other than stadium debt.\\r\\n? ?

Notable Cardinals who have served as GM but gained their notoriety through other roles while with the Cardinals include former outfielder Stan Musial and manager Whitey Herzog. Rickey, William Walsingham, Jr., Musial, Joe McDonald, Walt Jocketty and Mozeliak each won at least one World Series as Cardinals GM. Rickey won the most with four. Hall of Fame inductees who have served as GM for the Cardinals include Herzog, Musial and Rickey.","input":"Who is the owner of st louis cardinals?"},{"output":"the sixth season in 1980","context":"Laverne & Shirley (originally Laverne DeFazio & Shirley Feeney[1]) is an American sitcom that ran on ABC from January 27, 1976, to May 10, 1983. It starred Penny Marshall as Laverne DeFazio and Cindy Williams as Shirley Feeney, single roommates in Milwaukee who work as bottlecappers in the fictitious Shotz Brewery. Among others, the series was known for Marshall and Williams' physical comedy.[2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe show was a spin-off from Happy Days, as the two lead characters were originally introduced on that series as acquaintances of Fonzie (Henry Winkler). Set in roughly the same time period, the timeline started in approximately 1958, when the series began, through 1967, when the series ended. As with Happy Days, it was made by Paramount Television, created by Garry Marshall (along with Lowell Ganz and Mark Rothman) and executive produced by Garry Marshall, Edward K. Milkis, and Thomas L. Miller from Miller-Boyett Productions.\\r\\nCindy Williams had refused to do the tv series, so it was recast with Liberty Williams (no relation). A seven minute test scene was shot. According to Michael Eisner, \\"it was ok, but it wasn't magic.\\" Between that afternoon shoot and the evening, Cindy Williams was eventually talked into doing the role and the scene was reshot that night with what would become the iconic lead actors. Executives wanted to see both versions, but Eisner hid the first reel of film in a closet of the building and said at the screening that the film from the first shoot had gotten lost, so they only watched the performance of Cindy Williams with Penny Marshall.[4]\\r\\nAt the start of each episode, Laverne and Shirley are skipping down a Milwaukee street, arm in arm, reciting a Yiddish-American hopscotch chant: \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated,\\" which then leads into the series' theme song titled \\"Making Our Dreams Come True,\\" performed by Cyndi Grecco. The hopscotch chant is from Penny Marshall's childhood.[5] In seasons six and seven (set in 1960s Southern California), the intro features Laverne and Shirley exiting their apartment building, but still reciting their original chant, and then a re-recorded version of the theme song is played. During the final season (after Cindy Williams left the show), it opens with a group of schoolchildren performing the chant and marching toward an amused Laverne before the theme song begins.\\r\\nFor the first five seasons, from 1976 to 1980, the show was set in Milwaukee (executive producer Thomas L. Miller's home town), taking place from roughly 1958ÿ59 through the early 1960s. Shotz Brewery bottle cappers and best friends, Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney, live in a basement apartment, where they communicate with upstairs neighbors Lenny and Squiggy by screaming up the dumbwaiter shaft connecting their apartments. Also included in the show are Laverne's father, Frank DeFazio, proprietor of the Pizza Bowl, and Edna Babish, the apartment building's landlady, who would later marry Frank. Shirley maintained an off-again on-again romance with dancer/singer/boxer Carmine Ragusa. During this period, characters from Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley would make occasional guest appearances on each other's shows. During the fifth season, the girls went into the Army, and they contended with a tough-as-nails drill sergeant named Alvinia T. Plout (Vicki Lawrence).\\r\\nMichael McKean and David Lander created the characters of Lenny and Squiggy while both were theater students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[6] Lander told an interviewer in 2006 that they created the characters while high on marijuana.[6] After graduating, they continued to perform the characters in live comedy routines before joining the show's cast.\\r\\nFor the sixth season in 1980, Laverne and Shirley and their friends all moved from Milwaukee to Burbank, California. The girls took jobs at a department store, Frank and Edna managed a Texas BBQ restaurant called Cowboy Bill's, Carmine delivered singing telegrams and sought work as an actor, and Lenny and Squiggy started a talent agency called Squignowski Talent Agency. From this point until the end of the series' run, Laverne & Shirley was set in the mid-1960s. In one of the shots in the show's new opening sequence, the girls are seen kissing a 1964 poster of The Beatles. With each season, a new year passed in the timeline of the show, starting with 1965 in the 1980ÿ81 season, and ending in 1967 with Carmine heading off for Broadway, to star in the musical Hair.\\r\\nWhen the show moved to California, two new characters are added: Sonny St. Jacques, a stunt man, landlord of the Burbank apartment building and love interest for Laverne; as well as Rhonda Lee, the girls' neighbor and an aspiring actress.\\r\\nIn March 1982, Cindy Williams became pregnant with her first child. In May, Williams and her manager-husband Bill Hudson presented a list of demands to accommodate her pregnancy and pending child birth, which Paramount refused. In August, two episodes into production of the series' eighth season, Williams left the show and filed a $20 million lawsuit against Paramount. The case was later settled out of court and Williams was released from her contract.[7]\\r\\nAs for Shirley, she quickly falls in love in the two episodes produced before Williams' departure, and marries Army medic Walter Meany (making her Shirley Feeney Meany). In Williams' final scenes, Shirley discovers that she is pregnant. Shirley's absence is explained with a note left for Laverne saying that she had left town quickly to join her husband overseas.\\r\\nDespite the departure of Williams, ratings held steady and Laverne & Shirley ranked at #25 for the 1982ÿ83 season. ABC asked Penny Marshall to return for a ninth year, but she insisted that the show move its production base from Los Angeles to New York. Eyeing the cost of such an endeavor, and given the age of the show, ABC quietly canceled Laverne & Shirley in May 1983 after 178 episodes.\\r\\nThe final episode was produced like a backdoor pilot for a spin-off series for Carmine, which showed him moving to New York City to star in the Broadway show Hair. Laverne was seen only at the beginning and end of the episode. The spin-off show never materialized.\\r\\nLaverne Marie DeFazio (Penny Marshall) is known for being a tough-talking tomboy. She grew up in Brooklyn, with her Italian immigrant parents. Laverne's parents moved to Milwaukee, where her mother died. Laverne works alongside best friend and roommate Shirley. Milk and Pepsi is Laverne's favorite drink. Her trademark is the script letter \\"L\\" monogrammed on her shirts and sweaters, an idea Marshall got from seeing a vintage sweater in the wardrobe department with an initial sewn in the upper left corner, something that would help the audience remember that she is Laverne.[8]\\r\\nShirley Wilhelmina Feeney (Cindy Williams, Seasons 1-7) is the perky, positive one. She also tends to be meek, while Laverne is more outspoken. She later becomes a huge fan of teen-idol Fabian. Her overbearing mother Lily (Pat Carroll) expects more from Shirley than what she can give. Shirley is sensitive and tends to overreact. When she tries to hold back a laugh, she bites her knuckle on her index finger. Shirley works at Shotz brewery with Laverne. She has a special relationship with her stuffed cat Boo Boo Kitty, a name Williams gave the toy after forgetting a line in rehearsal, and was the name of her mother's cat.[9]\\r\\nLeonard \\"Lenny\\" Kosnowski (Michael McKean) is a lovable goof who pesters Laverne and Shirley, along with his best friend and roommate Squiggy, both of whom live upstairs from Laverne and Shirley's lower-level apartment. Lenny works as a truck driver at the Shotz brewery. Lenny says that, while he is not completely sure, he thinks his last name (Kosnowski) is Polish for \\"Help, there's a hog in my kitchen\\".\\r\\nAndrew \\"Squiggy\\" Squiggman (David Lander) works and lives with childhood friend Lenny. Squiggy makes nearly every entrance with his trademark \\"Hello\\" said in a comically dopey voice. In the final season, Squiggy's lookalike sister Squendoline is introduced.\\r\\nFrank DeFazio (Phil Foster) is Laverne's father who runs the Pizza Bowl, a local hang out. He later opens up Cowboy Bills in Burbank, California. Although he could be harsh and lose his temper, he did have a heart of gold. He loves Laverne very much, having been her only parent for years. His pet name for his daughter was \\"Muffin\\". Frank is also protective of Shirley, becoming somewhat of a surrogate father to her since her family was far away.\\r\\nCarmine Ragusa (Eddie Mekka) is Shirley's high-school sweetheart and on-again, off-again romance. \\"The Big Ragoo\\" is a part-time boxer and former Golden Gloves champion who owns a dance studio and is constantly working to make it big as a dancer and singer. In the final episode of the series, he auditions for the musical Hair, at last landing a major role on Broadway.\\r\\nEdna Babish DeFazio (Betty Garrett, Seasons 2-7) is the five-time-divorced landlady who eventually marries Laverne's father. Edna also occasionally sings and dances in the local brewery talent shows. When the series was extended beyond the intended final season, actress Betty Garrett committed to another project and was written out as having left Frank.\\r\\nRhonda Lee (Leslie Easterbrook, Seasons 6-8) is a tall, voluptuous, somewhat ditzy blonde actress/singer/dancer/model trying to get discovered and make it big in Hollywood. She is Laverne and Shirley's neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also comes off as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and to brag about her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men with the intention of making the girls envious.\\r\\nSonny St. Jacques (Ed Marinaro, Season 6) is a stuntman and Laverne and Shirley's landlord in Burbank. A tall, handsome, muscular man, Sonny is often seen with his shirt off or open. He was intended as a love interest for Laverne. After several episodes in Burbank, Sonny was written out of the show and rarely if ever mentioned again. (In reality, Marinaro left the series to star in Hill Street Blues.)\\r\\n(Big) Rosie Greenbaum (Carole Ita White) is the girls' childhood nemesis. She married a rich doctor and rubs this in the girls' faces, though they make fun of the fact that he is a proctologist. She is Laverne's rival and upsets her by calling her a \\"bimbo\\". Big Rosie and fellow Milwaukee classmate Terri Buttefuco both return in the season-seven episode \\"Class of '56\\".\\r\\nSgt. Alvinia T. Plout (Vicki Lawrence) is a tough-as-nails drill sergeant the girls meet when they go into the Army.\\r\\nOfficer Norman Hughes (Bo Kaprall) is a police officer and love interest for Laverne.\\r\\nMr. Hildebrand (Norman Bartold) is the girl's boss at Bardwell's Department Store.\\r\\nAlthough generally viewed as a slapstick comedy, a number of episodes included more dramatic storylines:\\r\\nLaverne & Shirley premiered in the 1975ÿ76 TV season, with its first episode airing in January 1976. By its third season, it had become the most-watched American television program. In August, 1979, before the start of its fifth season, Laverne & Shirley was moved to Thursday nights at 8:00 pm opposite The Waltons on CBS and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century on NBC. Viewership fell sharply. In an effort to improve the show's ratings, ABC moved Laverne & Shirley to Monday nights at 8:00 in December, 1979. The ratings fared no better, so in February, 1980, the network moved the series back to its familiar Tuesday night berth right after Happy Days, where it remained for the next three years. By the end of the fifth season, however, the sitcom failed to make the list of the top-30 programs. Between 1980 and 1982, the ratings improved considerably, but despite having regained its Tuesday-night time slot and changing its format, Laverne & Shirley never regained the popularity it had attained during its first four years on the air. By the time of its cancellation in 1983, it had ranked at number 25 for the season.\\r\\nDuring the run of the main show, an animated spin-off called Laverne & Shirley in the Army began airing on Saturday mornings. The first program was aired on October 10, 1981, and featured the voices of Marshall and Williams playing Laverne and Shirley in the Army with a talking piglet drill sergeant named \\"Squealy\\" (voiced by Welcome Back Kotter alum Ron Palillo). The show was renamed Laverne and Shirley with the Fonz when the Fonz began working in the motorpool as the chief mechanic, and then again renamed The Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour when new segments involving a teenaged Mork & Mindy were added to the mix. The series ran until September 3, 1983.\\r\\nThe program was so successful at the time that it spawned a merchandise franchise. Mego released two models of Laverne and Shirley dolls, and one model of Lenny and Squiggy dolls. Hot Wheels created a Shotz Brewery delivery van, and several novelty toys were sold such as Halloween costumes, a board game, jigsaw puzzles, coloring books, video slot machine[11] and other toys.[citation needed]\\r\\nParamount Home Entertainment and (starting with season 2) CBS DVD have released the entire series of Laverne and Shirley on DVD in Region 1, albeit with music substitutions and scene deletions.[12]\\r\\nOn June 16, 2015, CBS DVD will release Laverne & Shirley ÿ The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1.[13]\\r\\nSeason 1 has also been released on DVD in Region 2.\\r\\nThe first three seasons have been released on DVD in Region 4 by Paramount.\\r\\nThe theme song from the series (\\"Making Our Dreams Come True\\" as performed by Cyndi Grecco) was released as a single from Cyndi's LP by the same name and became a radio favorite, becoming a top-30 American hit in 1976.[14]\\r\\nIn 1976, Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams released an album, performed in character, titled Laverne & Shirley Sing, which contained some original songs along with some 1950s and 1960s standards. The album was originally released on Atlantic Records. On November 11, 2003, Collector's Choice released it on CD.\\r\\nIn 1979, Michael McKean and David Lander followed suit with the album Lenny and the Squigtones, also performed in character, featuring mainly original songs penned by McKean. The album was released on Casablanca Records.[15][16]\\r\\nMcKean and Lander also appeared together (in character) on American Bandstand performing the song \\"King of the Cars\\", the single released from their Lenny and the Squigtones album.\\r\\nIn 1980, Romina Power (of Al Bano and Romina Power fame) recorded a separate theme tune for the show when it was introduced to the Italian market. The track, simply titled \\"Laverne & Shirley\\" featured verses in English and Italian.

After the season ended, it was reported that Dunkleman had quit from co-hosting. Various news outlets later on said that he \\"had his career completely destroyed\\" for doing so, before it became enormously popular and made Seacrest very wealthy. However, one journalist believes that Dunkleman would have been fired had he not quit earlier,[1] a fact numerous Idol staffers would eventually admit: Dunkleman had submitted his resignation shortly before news of his firing could reach him.[2]\\r\\nDuring his 2008 appearance on the sixth season of the reality television weight loss show, Celebrity Fit Club on which he lost 15 pounds, and won the grand prize with his team, he spoke about his reasons for leaving American Idol following its first season. He stated his departure was due to the terrible way they treated the young contestants on the show, staging the fights between the judges and reshooting contestants with producer-provided glycerin tears in their eyes. He went on to say that leaving the show was a mistake. However, Ian K.

The Moorish Revival building is decorated with crop art; the murals and designs covering the building are made from corn and other grains, and a new design is constructed each year. The Corn Palace is a popular tourist destination, visited by up to 500,000 people each year.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Corn Palace serves the community as a venue for concerts, sports events, exhibits and other community events. Each year, the Corn Palace is celebrated with a citywide festival, the Corn Palace Festival. Historically it was held at harvest time in September, but recently it has been held at the end of August. Other popular annual events include the Corn Palace Stampede Rodeo in July and the Corn Palace Polka Festival in September. It is also home to the Dakota Wesleyan University Tigers and the Mitchell High School Kernels basketball teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 19th Century, a number of cities on the Great Plains constructed \\"crop palaces\\" (also known as \\"grain palaces\\") to promote themselves and their products.

It was a wooden castle structure on Mitchell's Main Street, built on land donated by Louis Beckwith, a member of the First Corn Palace Committee.[4] In 1904ÿ1905, the city of Mitchell mounted a challenge to the city of Pierre in an unsuccessful attempt to replace it as the state capital of South Dakota. As part of this effort, the Corn Palace was rebuilt in 1905. In 1921, the Corn Palace was rebuilt once again, with a design by the architectural firm Rapp and Rapp of Chicago. Russian-style onion domes and Moorish minarets were added in 1937, giving the Palace the distinctive appearance that it has today. It costs $130,000 annually to decorate the Palace.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exterior corn murals are replaced and redesigned each year with a new theme. The designs are created by local artists. From 1948 to 1971, the artist Oscar Howe designed the panels. Calvin Schultz designed the murals from 1977 to 2002.

D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is also known by its Tirio Indian name, okopipi. Its scientific name comes from its azure color. While frequently considered a valid species in the past, recent authorities treat it as a variant of D. tinctorius.[1][2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nD. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is a medium-sized frog that weighs about 8?g and grows to 3.0-4.5?cm in length. Females are larger and about half a centimeter longer than males, but males have larger toes. The frog has a typical lifespan of five to seven years in the wild. Its bright blue skin, usually darker around its limbs and stomach, serves as a warning to predators. The glands of poisonous alkaloids located a defense mechanism to potential predators. These poisons paralyze and sometimes kill the predator. The black spots are unique to each frog, enabling individuals to be identified. This species of frog has a distinctive hunch-backed posture.\\r\\nEach foot has four toes, which each have a flattened tip with a suction cup pad used for gripping. The tips of the toes in females are round, while males have heart-shaped tips.\\r\\nAs with almost all frogs, tadpoles differ greatly in appearance from adults. They have a long tail, about 6?mm, with a total length around 10?mm. They lack legs and have gills instead of lungs.\\r\\nD. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is a mainland animal, but stays close to water sources. These frogs spend most of their awake time, during the day, hopping around in short leaps. They are very territorial and aggressive both towards their own species and others. To ward off intruders, they use a series of calls, chases, and wrestling. Although poison dart frogs are known for their skin toxins, used on the tips of arrows or darts of natives, in reality only the species of the Phyllobates genus are used in this manner. In captivity, the frogs lose toxicity as a result of altered diets.\\r\\nThe blue poison dart frog breeds seasonally, usually during February or March when the weather is rainy. To find mates, the males sit on a rock and produce quiet calls, which the females follow to track down the males. The females then physically fight over a male. The male takes the female to a quiet place by water, which becomes the site of the egg-laying. Fertilization occurs externally; once the eggs are laid, the male covers them in his sperm.\\r\\nBetween five and 10 offspring are produced at each mating. Eggs are laid in the males territory, which he defends. The male takes care of the eggs, sometimes joined by the female. The eggs hatch after 14 to 18 days, and after 10 to 12 weeks the tadpoles are fully mature. Both sexes reach sexual maturity at two years of age. The expected lifespan of D. tinctorius \\"azureus\\" is between 4 and 6 years in the wild, and about 10 years in captivity.\\r\\nThe blue poison dart frog feeds on ants, beetles, flies, mites, spiders, termites, maggots, and caterpillars.\\r\\nIn captivity, like most captive dart frogs, they eat a staple diet of fruit flies, pinhead crickets, rice flour beetle larvae, and springtails.\\r\\n Media related to Blue poison dart frog at Wikimedia Commons","input":"Where does the blue poison dart frog live?"},{"output":"generally viewed as lacking in the fundamental requirements of due process","context":"The \\"Sleepy Lagoon murder\\" was the name that Los Angeles newspapers used to describe the death of Jos Gallardo Daz, who was discovered unconscious and dying on a road near a swimming hole (known as the Sleepy Lagoon) in Commerce, California on the morning of August 2, 1942.\\r\\nDaz was taken by ambulance to Los Angeles County General Hospital, where he died shortly after, never having regained consciousness. The hospital autopsy showed that he was inebriated from a party the previous night and had a fracture at the base of his skull. This might have been caused by repeated falls or an automobile accident. The cause of his death remains a mystery to this day. However, Los Angeles Police were quick to arrest 17 Mexican-American youths as suspects. Despite insufficient evidence, the young men were held in prison, without bail, on charges of murder. The trial ended on January 13, 1943, under Judge Charles W. Fricke. Nine of the defendants were convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to serve time in San Quentin Prison. The rest of the suspects were charged with lesser offenses and incarcerated in Los Angeles County Jail.[1] The convictions were reversed on appeal in 1944. The case is considered a precursor to the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943.\\r\\nSleepy Lagoon was a reservoir beside the Los Angeles River that was frequented by Mexican-Americans. Its name came from the popular song \\"Sleepy Lagoon\\", by big band leader and trumpeter Harry James. The reservoir was located near the city of Maywood at approximately 5500 Slauson Avenue in Bell, California.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the internment of Japanese Americans, racial tension in California shifted toward the Mexican-American community and, spurred by the media, a grand jury headed by E. Duran Ayres was appointed by the City of Los Angeles to investigate an alleged \\"Mexican Crime Wave.\\"[2]\\r\\nThe morning of August 2, 1942, Jos Daz was found unconscious and later died in the hospital. The autopsy revealed that Daz was intoxicated and that death was the result of blunt head trauma. Despite one medical examiner stating that the injuries were consistent with being hit by a car, 20-year-old Henry Leyvas and 24 members of what the media termed \\"the 38th Street gang\\" were arrested for allegedly murdering Daz. They suspected that rival Pachuco gang fights were the cause of Daz's death.\\r\\nIn response to the alleged murder, the media began a campaign calling for action against \\"zoot suiters\\" which led police on August 10 to conduct a roundup of 600 Latinos who were charged with suspicion of assault, armed robbery, and related offenses; 175 were eventually held for various crimes.[2]\\r\\nThe resulting criminal trial is now generally viewed as lacking in the fundamental requirements of due process. Seventeen Latino youths were indicted on the murder charges and placed on trial.[3] The courtroom was small and during the trial the defendants were not allowed to sit near, or to communicate with, their attorneys. None of those charged were permitted to change their clothes during the trial by order of Judge Fricke at the request of the district attorney on the grounds that the jury should see the defendants in the zoot suits that were \\"obviously\\" only worn by \\"hoodlums\\". Every time a name was mentioned by a witness or the district attorney, regardless of how damning the statement was, the named defendant was required to stand up.[2] Judge Fricke also permitted the chief of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office, E. Duran Ayres, to testify as an \\"expert witness\\" that Mexicans as a community had a \\"blood-thirst\\" and a \\"biological predisposition\\" to crime and killing, citing the culture of human sacrifice practiced by their Aztec ancestors.[4]\\r\\nThe Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee was a community organization made up of Los Angeles community members and activists who came together to support the defendants. The SLDC (Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee) was also known as The Citizens' Committee for the Defense of Mexican-American Youth. The committee was labeled a Communist front organization by the California state legislature's Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities headed by Jack Tenney. Some SLDC members included: Alice McGrath, Josefina Fierro de Bright, Josefa Fierro, Maria Alvez, Luisa Moreno, Dorothy Healey, LaRue McCormick, Lupe Leyvas, Henry Leyvas, Doc Johnson, Frank Lopez, Bert Corona, and Gray Bemis. The SLDC's mission was to mount a civil rights crusade so that \\"these Mexican-American defendants might have a full measure of justice under the Constitution\\". The SLDC utilized their contacts with influential community members to promote their cause and for fund-raising purposes to be able to support their cause. After Judge Fricke's verdict in January, the Mexican-American youths were imprisoned without evidence and because they were \\"Mexican and dangerous\\", ipso facto. The Mexican American community was outraged and several attorneys challenged Judge Fricke's decisions: George Shibley, Robert Kenny, Clore Ware, Ben Margolis, John McTernan, Carey McWilliams, and several others. Together they hoped to remind the American society that minorities had the right to testify in court and have impartial jury trials.[5] McWilliams noted that a few months earlier over 120,000 Japanese Americans were detained and interned in detention camps, and later argued that there were common links between the Japanese-American internment and the anti-Mexican response in the Sleepy Lagoon case.[6] From 1943 through 1944, the state anti-Communist Tenney Committee subpoenaed and investigated the members of the Defense Committee in an attempt to uncover Communist ties.[7]\\r\\nIn October 1944, the state Court of Appeals unanimously decided the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. It reversed the 12 defendants' convictions, in the case of People v Zammora 66 Cal.App.2d 166. The appeals court also criticized the trial judge for his bias and mishandling of the case.[8]\\r\\nThe 1979 play Zoot Suit and the 1981 movie Zoot Suit are loosely based on events surrounding the murder trial.

Half-time (also written halftime or half time) is the name given to the interval between the two halves of the match. Typically, after half-time teams swap ends of the field of play, in order to reduce any advantage that may be gained from wind or a slope to the playing surface, for example.\\r\\nWhile it exists mainly to allow competitors to rest briefly and recover from the play of the first half, half-time also serves a number of other purposes. It also serves as an intermission for spectators, and it often features entertainment, such as cheerleading performances, tifos, performances by school marching bands (particularly in high school and collegiate sports in North America), or concerts featuring popular music acts (particularly in major events, such as the Super Bowl). On games that are broadcast on television and radio, it also provides broadcasters with an opportunity to give a recap of the first half of the game, air highlights of other games in progress, air commercials and other advertisements, provide analysis on the game, or air game-related festivities (such as an aforementioned half-time performance). In the NFL (National Football League), halftime is usually around 12 minutes. Although major events like the Super Bowl have around 30 minutes of halftime featuring a musical performance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe origin of changing ends at half-time lies in the early English public school football games. One early use of a fixed half-time, and it is suggested the origin of the practice, was to allow for two football teams each used to a different set of rules to play half of the game by familiar rules, and half by the opposition rules. This was practised notably between followers of Eton-rules football (closer to modern association football) and Rugby-rules football (closer to modern rugby Rugby union). This use of half-time was unnecessary after the standardisation of football rules in 1863 (see Laws of the Game) but is still used for the now-rare contests between teams playing different codes of football. Changing ends at half-time (if no goals had been scored) was part of the following schools' codes: Brighton, Eton, Rossall, Sheffield, and Winchester. Other schools changed every time that side scored (Cheltenham, FA, Harrow, Marlborough, Rugby, Shrewsbury, Uppingham schools)[1] The 1863 Cambridge Rules state: \\"In a match when half the time agreed upon has elapsed, the side shall change goals when the ball is next out of play\\".\\r\\nOne benefit of half-time in a field game is to allow teams to swap their positions on the field in order that the effects of the natural conditions such as sunlight and wind direction are experienced fairly by both teams. In some sports this is achieved without the need for half-time: for example, in cricket fielding positions of players are rotated after a set passage of play. In other sports no such provision is necessary, for example in baseball, where playing positions do not change and both teams occupy the same locations on the field of play, though there is frequent rotation of players in the ordinary course of play.\\r\\nHalf-time for spectators offers the opportunity to visit the toilet, get some food or drink, or just exercise cramped limbs, without the fear of missing any of the action. A half-time show may be put on for the spectators to keep their attention, most famously in the case of the American football Super Bowl. As many spectators at the ground may be otherwise occupied using stadium facilities it might be inferred that the scale and spectacle of half-time entertainment is more directly related to the size of the potential television audience.\\r\\nIn many sports that are televised, half-time offers the opportunity to advertise, a valuable source of revenue for television companies. In addition, it allows analysis of the game so far by pundits; controversial incidents or exceptional play may be highlighted at this time. It also allows viewers to catch up with any action that they may have missed. Half-time has spawned one of the most enduring clichs to describe football: that \\"it's a game of two halves.\\"[2]\\r\\n(other than to allow movement of players in the natural course of play and/or TV commercials)","input":"How long is the halftime at the super bowl?"},{"output":"Southern Europe","context":"","input":"What region of the world is greece in?"},{"output":"Andrew Johnson","context":"The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson occurred in 1868, when the United States House of Representatives resolved to impeach President Andrew Johnson, adopting eleven articles of impeachment detailing his \\"high crimes and misdemeanors,\\"[1] in accordance with Article Two of the United States Constitution. The House's primary charge against Johnson was with violation of the Tenure of Office Act, passed by Congress the previous year. Specifically, he had removed Edwin McMasters Stanton, the Secretary of War, whom the Tenure of Office Act was largely designed to protect, from office and attempted to replace him with Brevet Major General Lorenzo Thomas. Contrary to popular belief, Johnson was not impeached for temporarily replacing Stanton with General Ulysses Grant earlier while Congress was not in session.[2]\\r\\nThe House formally agreed to the articles of impeachment on March 2, 1868, and forwarded them to the Senate. The trial in the Senate began three days later, with Chief Justice of the United States Salmon P. Chase presiding. The first vote on one of the eleven impeachment articles concluded on May 16 with a failure to convict Johnson. A ten-day recess was called before attempting to convict him on additional articles, but that effort failed on May 26. The 35-to-19 votes on the three articles actually voted on were all one short of the required two-thirds needed for conviction.\\r\\nThis was the first impeachment of an incumbent President since creation of the office in 1789. The culmination of a lengthy political battle between Johnson and the Republican majority in Congress over how best to deal with the defeated Southern states following the conclusion of the American Civil War, the impeachment, and the subsequent trial (and acquittal) of Johnson were among the most dramatic events in the political life of the nation during the Reconstruction Era. Together, they have gained a historical reputation as an act of political expedience, rather than necessity, which was based on Johnson's defiance of an unconstitutional piece of legislation, and which was conducted with little regard for the will of a general public which, despite the unpopularity of Johnson, opposed the impeachment. There would not be another serious attempt to impeach a President for 106 years when, during the Watergate scandal, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment of President Nixon and sent them to the full House for consideration; Nixon then resigned from office, rather than face impeachment and trial, which his advisors told him he would lose. The only other actual impeachment trial of a President would occur 24 years later with the impeachment of Bill Clinton, who was also acquitted by the Senate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTension between the executive and legislative branches had been high since shortly after Johnson's ascension to the White House upon the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Though a Southerner himself, Johnson had been a fierce and unrelenting critic of the Southern secession that had sparked the Civil War in the first place. Prior to his murder, Lincoln had favored a very moderate and lenient plan for Reconstruction. Although the Radical Republicans had vehemently opposed Lincoln's Reconstruction policies, the 16th President was immensely popular in the North and thus able to deprive the Radicals of the political capital they would need to successfully oppose his agenda. [3]\\r\\nRadical Republicans were convinced that President Johnson would enact their hardline Reconstruction policies of protection for newly freed slaves and punishment for former slave owners, government, and military officials. Instead, Johnson unexpectedly switched course, rejecting the Radicals. Within six weeks of taking office, Johnson had offered proclamations of general amnesty for most former Confederates, and his initially stricter plans for high-ranking government and military officers quickly dissolved. Johnson also vetoed legislation that extended civil rights and financial support for the former slaves. Congress was able to override only a few of his vetoes, setting the stage for a confrontation between Congress and the president.[4]\\r\\nIn August and September 1866, Johnson destroyed his own political support on a speaking tour of Northern states that became known as the Swing Around the Circle. Meant to establish a coalition of voters who would support Johnson in the upcoming midterm congressional elections, the tour instead destroyed his reputation when reports of his undisciplined, vitriolic speeches and ill-advised confrontations with hecklers swept the nation. Contrary to Johnson's hopes, the midterm elections led to veto-proof Republican majorities in Congress. The Radicals were not only able to pass civil rights legislation, but wrested control of Reconstruction from the president and took the reins themselves by carving the old Confederacy into five military districts.[5]\\r\\nCongress' control of the military Reconstruction policy was mitigated by Johnson's command of the military as president; however, Johnson had inherited, as Secretary of War, Lincoln's appointee Edwin M. Stanton, a staunch Radical Republican, who as long as he remained in office would comply with Congressional Reconstruction policies. To ensure that Stanton would not be replaced, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 over Johnson's veto. The act required the President to seek the Senate's advice and consent before relieving or dismissing any member of his Cabinet or, indeed, any federal official whose initial appointment had previously required its advice and consent.[6] However, the act was written specifically with Stanton in mind.[7]\\r\\nBecause the Tenure of Office Act did permit the President to suspend such officials when Congress was out of session, when Johnson failed to obtain Stanton's resignation, he instead suspended Stanton on August 5, 1867, which gave him the opportunity to appoint General Ulysses S. Grant, then serving as Commanding General of the Army, Secretary of War ad interim. Johnson and Grant would later disagree on an understanding between the two of them. If the Senate later failed to concur with Johnson's removal of Stanton, the President claimed that Grant agreed to either remain in office or pre-notify Johnson that he would resign so that Johnson could replace him. Johnson's purpose was to create a court case to test the constitutionality of the Tenure Act. Grant later claimed there was no such agreement.[8]\\r\\nOn January 7, 1868, the Senate passed a resolution (35-to-6) of non-concurrence with Stanton's dismissal. Grant wrote his resignation letter that same day and vacated the office, but he did not notify Johnson of this. Consequently, Stanton re-occupied the office of the Secretary of War. At a cabinet meeting the following day, Grant made stammering, unintelligible excuses for failing to pre-notify Johnson.[9] Believing the Tenure of Office Act unconstitutional, Johnson ignored the Senate's reinstatement of Stanton until, on January 28, he offered the post to Lorenzo Thomas, a brevet major general in the Army, who first turned it down, saying that he would like to stay in office as Adjutant General until his retirement. (The President originally wanted the position for General William Tecumseh Sherman, who was an enemy of Stanton's, but Sherman turned the President down, saying he hated politics.) Johnson later convinced Thomas to help him make a test case, however, and on February 21, 1868, the President appointed Lorenzo Thomas Secretary of War and ordered the removal of Stanton from office. Thomas personally delivered the President's dismissal notice to Stanton, but the Secretary refused either to accept its legitimacy or to vacate the premises. Instead, Stanton had barricaded himself in his office and ordered Thomas arrested for violating the Tenure of Office Act.[10]\\r\\nThomas asked if he could be brought to the White House to let the President know that he had been placed under arrest. When Stanton realized, however, that the arrest would allow the courts to review the law, he had the charges dropped. Stanton then claimed that Johnson had broken the recently instituted Tenure of Office Act by removing a Cabinet member without Senate approval.\\r\\nThe political rhetoric escalated. On February 22, 1868, Representative William D. Kelley of Philadelphia orated:\\r\\nSir, the bloody and untilled fields of the ten unreconstructed States, the unsheeted ghosts of the two thousand murdered negroes in Texas, cry, if the dead ever evoke vengeance, for the punishment of Andrew Johnson.[11]\\r\\nOn February 24, 1868 three days after Johnson's dismissal of Stanton, the House of Representatives voted 126 to 47 in favor of a resolution to impeach the President for high crimes and misdemeanors. The two sponsors of the resolution, Thaddeus Stevens and John A. Bingham, were immediately dispatched to inform the Senate that the House had officially voted for impeachment.\\r\\nOne week later, the House adopted eleven articles of impeachment against the President. The articles charged Johnson with:\\r\\nThe eleventh article was a summation of the first ten.\\r\\nA trial started in the Senate, presided by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, and committees were organized to represent the prosecution and defense. The impeachment committee was made up of Thaddeus Stevens, Benjamin F. Butler, John A. Bingham, John A. Logan, George S. Boutwell, Thomas Williams and James F. Wilson. Johnson's defense team was made up of Alexander Morgan, Henry Stanbery, William M. Evarts, Benjamin R. Curtis, Thomas A. R. Nelson and Jeremiah S. Black (who resigned before the trial began). The trial began on March 13, 1868.[12]\\r\\nA Vice President is only permitted to vote in the case of a tie vote. Since an impeachment conviction requires a two-thirds vote from the Senators present, a Vice President will either not be voting or will cast an inconsequential vote. During Johnson's trial, there was no Vice President. However, the Senate President pro tempore, Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, who was among the Radical Republican leaders, would, under the Presidential succession act then in force and effect, become President if Johnson was convicted. Indiana Senator Thomas Hendricks questioned Wade's impartiality and suggested that Wade abstain from voting. But Hendricks was persuaded to withdraw his objection a day later and leave the matter to Wade's own conscience. Subsequently, Wade voted for conviction.[13]\\r\\nChief Justice Chase, who was himself a Radical Republican, ruled that Johnson should be permitted to present evidence that Thomas's appointment to replace Secretary of War Edwin Stanton was intended to provide a test case to challenge the constitutionality of the Tenure of Office Act. The Senate, however, overruled Chase by a simple majority vote.[14]\\r\\nBefore the trial started Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio made a surprise attempt on 28 February to add two reliably Radical members to the senate by gaining the admission of Colorado, over Johnson's anticipated veto, as a state. But Wade could not corral the necessary two-thirds majority to override Johnson's expected veto. The attempt, therefore, failed. A separate attempt was made just before the scheduled verdict vote in May to admit senators from selected Reconstruction states in order to add more reliably Radical members to the vote, but it was also unsuccessful.[15]\\r\\nOn the first day, Johnson's defense committee asked for forty days to collect evidence and witnesses since the prosecution had had a longer amount of time to do so, but only ten days were granted. The proceedings began on March 23. Senator Garrett Davis argued that because not all states were represented in the Senate the trial could not be held and that it should therefore be adjourned. The motion was voted down. After the charges against the president were made, Henry Stanbery asked for another thirty days to assemble evidence and summon witnesses, saying that in the ten days previously granted there had only been enough time to prepare the president's reply. John A. Logan argued that the trial should begin immediately and that Stanberry was only trying to stall for time. The request was turned down in a vote 41 to 12. However, the Senate voted the next day to give the defense six more days to prepare evidence, which was accepted.[16]\\r\\nThe trial commenced again on March 30. Benjamin F. Butler opened for the prosecution with a three-hour speech reviewing historical impeachment trials, dating from King John of England. For days Butler spoke out against Johnson's violations of the Tenure of Office Act and further charged that the president had issued orders directly to Army officers without sending them through General Grant. The defense argued that Johnson had not violated the Tenure of Office Act because President Lincoln did not reappoint Stanton as Secretary of War at the beginning of his second term in 1865 and that he was therefore a leftover appointment from the 1860 cabinet, which removed his protection by the Tenure of Office Act. The prosecution called several witnesses in the course of the proceedings until April 9, when they rested their case.[17]\\r\\nBenjamin R. Curtis called attention to the fact that after the House passed the Tenure of Office Act, the Senate had amended it, meaning that it had to return it to a Senate-House conference committee to resolve the differences. He followed up by quoting the minutes of those meetings, which revealed that while the House members made no notes about the fact, their sole purpose was to keep Stanton in office, and the Senate had disagreed. The defense then called their first witness, Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas. He did not provide adequate information in the defense's cause and Butler made attempts to use his information to the prosecution's advantage. The next witness was General William T. Sherman, who testified that President Johnson had offered to appoint Sherman to succeed Stanton as Secretary of War in order to ensure that the department was effectively administered. This testimony damaged the prosecution, which expected Sherman to testify that Johnson offered to appoint Sherman for the purpose of obstructing the operation, or overthrow, of the government. Sherman essentially affirmed that Johnson only wanted him to manage the department and not to execute directions to the military that would be contrary to the will of Congress.[18]\\r\\nThe Senate then had fifty-four members representing the twenty-seven states whose legislatures could then elect Senators; of these, thirty-six \\"guilty\\" votes were required to remove Johnson from office. On all three occasions, 35 Senators voted \\"guilty\\" and 19 \\"not guilty.\\" As the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority for conviction in impeachment trials, Johnson was acquitted.\\r\\nSeven Republican senators were concerned that the proceedings had been manipulated to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators William Pitt Fessenden (Maine), Joseph S. Fowler (Tennessee), James W. Grimes (Iowa), John B. Henderson (Missouri), Lyman Trumbull (Illinois), Peter G. Van Winkle (West Virginia),[19] and Edmund G. Ross (Kansas), who provided the decisive vote,[20] defied their party by voting against conviction. In addition to the above seven, three more Republicans James Dixon (Connecticut), James Doolittle (Wisconsin), and Daniel Norton (Minnesota) and all nine Democratic Senators voted not guilty.\\r\\nOn decision day, before the first vote was taken, Samuel Pomeroy, who was the senior senator from Kansas, told the junior Kansas Senator Ross that if Ross voted for acquittal that Ross would become the subject of an investigation for bribery.[21]\\r\\nThe first 35-to-19 vote was taken on 16 May for the eleventh article. In hopes of persuading at least one of the seven Republican acquittal senators to change his vote, the Senate adjourned for ten days to take a second vote on 26 May on the other articles. During the hiatus, under Butler's leadership, the House put through a resolution to investigate alleged \\"improper or corrupt means used to influence the determination of the Senate\\". But the pressure did not change any of the acquittal votes, with the result that the vote on 26 May was the same. After the trial, Ben Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal. In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards. Nonetheless, the investigations never resulted in charges, much less convictions, against anyone.[22]\\r\\nMoreover, there is evidence that the prosecution attempted to bribe the senators voting for acquittal to switch their votes to conviction. Maine Senator Fessenden was offered the Ministership to Great Britain. Prosecutor Butler said, \\"Tell [Kansas Senator Ross] that if he wants money there is a bushel of it here to be had.\\"[23] Butler's investigation also boomeranged when it was discovered that Kansas Senator Pomeroy, who voted for conviction, had written a letter to Johnson's Postmaster General seeking a $40,000 bribe for Pomeroy's acquittal vote along with three or four others in his caucus.[24] Benjamin Butler was himself told by Ben Wade that Wade would appoint Butler as Secretary of State when Wade assumed the Presidency after a Johnson conviction.[25] An opinion that Senator Ross was mercilessly persecuted for his courageous vote to sustain the independence of the Presidency as a branch of the Federal Government is the subject of an entire chapter in President John F. Kennedy's book, Profiles in Courage.[26] That opinion has been rejected by some scholars, such as Ralph Roske, and endorsed by others, such as Avery Craven.[27][28]\\r\\nNot one of the Republican senators who voted for acquittal ever again served in an elective office.[29] Although they were under intense pressure to change their votes to conviction during the trial, afterward public opinion rapidly shifted around to their viewpoint. Some senators who voted for conviction, such as John Sherman and even Charles Sumner, later changed their minds .[30][31][32]\\r\\nJohnson's acquittal propelled a body of the citizenry to submit a memorial or petition to Congress, calling for the abolition of the presidency. In the memorial, the petitioners argued that only two forms of government exist: absolute monarchy and absolute democracy. They claimed President Johnson had abused the powers of the presidency and impeachment was the only solution. Johnson's acquittal proved to the petitioners that the role of the presidency had grown too powerful and the only solution was the abolition of the office. The petitioners proposed an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that abolished the presidency and transferred the powers of the executive office to a body composed of members of Congress or of \\"competent citizens\\", chosen by Congress and supervised by a standing committee.[33]\\r\\nIn 1887, the Tenure of Office Act was repealed by Congress, and subsequent rulings by the United States Supreme Court seemed to support Johnson's position that he was entitled to fire Stanton without Congressional approval. The Supreme Court's ruling on a similar piece of later legislation in the 1926 Myers v. United States affirmed the ability of the president to remove a postmaster without Congressional approval, and stated in its majority opinion \\"that the Tenure of Office Act of 1867...was invalid.\\"[34]\\r\\nLyman Trumbull of Illinois, one of the seven Republican Senators whose refusal to vote for conviction prevented Johnson's removal from office, noted, in the speech he gave explaining his vote for acquittal, that had Johnson been convicted, the main source of the President's political powerthe freedom not to agree with the Congress without consequenceswould have been destroyed, and the Constitution's system of checks and balances along with it:\\r\\nOnce set the example of impeaching a President for what, when the excitement of the hour shall have subsided, will be regarded as insufficient causes, as several of those now alleged against the President were decided to be by the House of Representatives only a few months since, and no future President will be safe who happens to differ with a majority of the House and two thirds of the Senate on any measure deemed by them important, particularly if of a political character. Blinded by partisan zeal, with such an example before them, they will not scruple to remove out of the way any obstacle to the accomplishment of their purposes, and what then becomes of the checks and balances of the Constitution, so carefully devised and so vital to its perpetuity? They are all gone.","input":"Who's the first president to be impeached?"},{"output":"Fort Davis","context":"Fort Davis is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jeff Davis County, Texas, United States.

The airport was initially built during World War II and is named after Murtala Muhammed, the 4th military ruler of Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airport at Ikeja near Lagos was built during World War II. West African Airways Corporation was formed in 1947 and had its main base at Ikeja. De Havilland Doves were initially operated on WAACs Nigerian internal routes and then West African services.[5] Larger Douglas Dakotas were added to the Ikeja-based fleet from 1957.[6]\\r\\nOriginally known as Lagos International Airport,[7] it was renamed in the mid 1970s, during construction of the new international terminal, after a former Nigerian military head of state Murtala Muhammed. The international terminal was modelled after Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The new terminal opened officially on 15 March 1979. It is the main base for Nigeria's largest airline, Arik Air.\\r\\nMurtala Muhammed International Airport consists of an international and a domestic terminal, located about one kilometre from each other. Both terminals share the same runways. This domestic terminal used to be the old Ikeja Airport. International operations moved to the new international airport when it was ready while domestic operations moved to the Ikeja Airport, which became the domestic airport. The domestic operations were relocated to the old Lagos domestic terminal in 2000 after a fire. A new domestic privately funded terminal known as MMA2 has been constructed and was commissioned on 7 April 2007.\\r\\nDuring the late 1980s and 1990s, the international terminal had a reputation of being a dangerous airport. From 1992 through 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration posted warning signs in all US international airports advising travelers that security conditions at Lagos Airport did not meet ICAO minimum standards. In 1993, the FAA suspended air service between Lagos and the United States. During this period, security at LOS continued to be a serious problem.[8] Travelers arriving in Lagos were harassed both inside and outside of the airport terminal by criminals. Airport staff contributed to its reputation. Immigration officers required bribes before stamping passports, while customs agents demanded payment for nonexistent fees. In addition, several jet airplanes were attacked by criminals who stopped planes taxiing to and from the terminal and robbed their cargo holds.\\r\\nFollowing Olusegun Obasanjo's democratic election in 1999, the security situation at Lagos began to improve. Airport police instituted a \\"shoot on sight\\" policy for anyone found in the secure areas around runways and taxiways, stopping further airplane robberies. Police secured the inside of the terminal and the arrival areas outside. The FAA ended its suspension of direct flights to Nigeria in 2001 in recognition of these security improvements.[citation needed] By 2010, the FAA had granted the airport its highest safety rating.[8]\\r\\nIn 2010, the airport served 6,273,545 passengers.[9]\\r\\nRecent years[when?] have seen substantial improvements at Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Malfunctioning and non-operational infrastructures such as air conditioning and luggage belts have been repaired.

Cuomo Bridge after former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, is a twin cable-stayed bridge being built to replace the original Tappan Zee Bridge over New York's Hudson River. The new twin spans will be located to the north ofÿand roughly parallel toÿthe existing Tappan Zee Bridge, crossing the Hudson River in a parallel eastÿwest direction.\\r\\nIn the new bridge's final configuration, the north span will carry the northbound and westbound automobile traffic of I-87 and I-287; it will also carry a shared-use path for bicycles and pedestrians. The south span will carry the southbound and eastbound automobile traffic of I-87 and I-287.\\r\\nTappan Zee Constructors began construction in 2013. The north span officially opened to westbound traffic on August 26, 2017; it also opened to eastbound traffic on October 6, 2017. Tappan Zee Constructors then began demolishing the old bridge. Eastbound traffic will be switched to the south span upon its completion. Both spans are expected to be operational by the end of 2018.[4]\\r\\nThe official name of the bridge has been controversial since its announcement, with a petition and proposed legislation opposing the attachment of Mario Cuomo's name to the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Tappan Zee river crossing was named by 17th century Dutch settlers.[5] The Tappan Zee Bridge and the smaller Bear Mountain Bridge are the only crossings of the stretch of the Hudson between Westchester and Rockland counties, both of which are part of New York City's populous northern suburbs.\\r\\nThe original Tappan Zee Bridge was a cantilever bridge built from 1952 to 1955.[6][7] The bridge was 3 miles (4.8?km) long and spanned the Hudson at its second-widest point. It was the longest bridge in New York State, at a length of 16,013 feet (4,881?m) including approaches.[8] Built immediately after the Korean War, the bridge had a low construction budget of only $81 million and a designed life-span of only 50 years.[9] During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000 vehicles per day.\\r\\nBy the 2000s, the bridge was \\"decaying\\" and \\"overburdened\\".[9] The deteriorating structure bore an average of 140,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its designed capacity.[10] The collapse of Minnesota's I-35W Mississippi River bridge in 2007 raised worries about the Tappan Zee Bridge's structural integrity.[11] These concerns, together with traffic overcapacity and increased maintenance costs, escalated the serious discussions already ongoing about replacing the Tappan Zee with a tunnel or a new bridge.[12][13] Six options were identified and submitted for project study and environmental review.[14]\\r\\nThe 1950s Tappan Zee bridge was retired from service in 2017, as a replacement bridge was constructed.[10] The new bridge is intended to last at least 100 years.[15]\\r\\nThe Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee's replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge. The new bridge is now under construction a few yards to the north of the existing bridge, and will connect to the existing highway approaches of the New York State Thruway (I-87/I-287) on both river banks.[16] Construction began as scheduled during October 2013,[17][18] with completion targeted for 2017.[19] After some delays, the project is currently expected to be completed by June 15, 2018,[20] at a cost of $3.98 billion.[21]\\r\\nOriginally, some motorists thought that bridge tolls could more than double (to $12-$15 for automobiles, eastbound only), rising to those of New York City's Hudson River crossings.[15] However, the state passed legislation freezing the toll on the bridge at $5 through 2020 in its 2016 legislative session.[22]\\r\\nThe new Tappan Zee Bridge was proposed to include four vehicle lanes on each span, for a total of eight lanes, as well as a shared-use bicycle and pedestrian path. Like its predecessor, the new Tappan Zee Bridge is to be administered by the New York State Thruway Authority. The authority is the project co-sponsor, along with the state Department of Transportation.[16]\\r\\nThe New York Metropolitan Transportation Council added the Tappan Zee Bridge to its list of projects eligible for federal funds in August 2012.[23] The United States Department of Transportation approved the plan on September 25, 2012. The approval process took fewer than 10 months as opposed to the traditional multi-year process as a result of being placed on a \\"fast track\\" for approval by the Obama Administration.[24] On December 17, 2012, New York state officials dropped their proposal for a 45 percent increase on the state Thruway toll for trucks, while advancing a $3.14 billion project to replace the bridge.[25]\\r\\nThe new Tappan Zee Bridge was built by Tappan Zee Constructors, a design-build LLC composed of Fluor Corporation, American Bridge Company, Granite Construction Northeast and Traylor Bros. The Left Coast Lifter was used to install groups of pre-assembled girders one full span at a time.[26] By the end of 2013, General Electric had completed four seasons of dredging to remove contaminants from the river bottom. Approximately 70 percent of the sediments targeted for dredging were removed (totaling more than 1,900,000 cubic yards (1,500,000?m3) of sediment).[27]\\r\\nThe project timeline originally indicated that the old bridge would be closed in 2016 and that the demolition of the old bridge would begin in February 2017,[28] however, that timeline has since been amended. The first span of the bridge opened to westbound traffic on August 26, 2017,[3] and the project is expected to be completed by June 15, 2018.[20]\\r\\nWhen completed, the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the widest cable-stayed bridges in the world, having a combined width across both decks of 183 feet (56?m).[2] The new spans will equal the width of the relatively short-span, cable-stayed Leonard Zakim Bridge in downtown Boston.[29] Turkey's 3rd Bosphorus bridge, completed in 2016, has a single deck about 192 feet (59?m) wide. The new Tappan Zee Bridge will also be one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.[2][not in citation given]\\r\\nOn July 19, 2016, a crane used for the construction of the bridge collapsed onto the existing older bridge. Five people were injured, including three drivers and two bridge workers; no one was killed or critically injured.[30][31]\\r\\nThe new northbound/westbound span opened on August 26, 2017.[3][32] Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the existing span until October 6, 2017, when it was shifted to the new northbound/westbound span to allow for the completion of the new southbound/eastbound span.[33] The northbound/westbound span of the new Tappan Zee Bridge temporarily has four lanes in both directions until the new southbound/eastbound span is complete.\\r\\nWest of the Tappan Zee, the 680,000 residents of Rockland and Orange counties currently have very limited mass transit to New York City via NJ Transit's Port Jervis Line and Pascack Valley Line commuter rail services or Coach USA's Rockland Coaches bus services. The bridge plan includes as an objective merely, \\"Providing a crossing that does not preclude future trans-Hudson transit services.\\"[16]\\r\\nA proposed bus rapid transit system using the new bridge was shelved as too expensive. However, the bridge was structurally built for expansion with BRT and/or commuter rail at a later date. The existing Tarrytown station of the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line is located about 2,000 feet (610?m) from the new bridge's eastern landing. In 2011, the state estimated that a bus connector to the station would cost about $151 million, about 3 percent of the bridge's projected cost.[34] Responding to widespread concerns about the lack of new public transit service, bridge planners agreed only to build one \\"dedicated express bus lane\\" in each direction for use during rush hour.[35]\\r\\nDuring construction, the project's website referred to the crossing as the \\"New NY Bridge\\".[36] However, other sources referred to the crossing as the \\"New Tappan Zee Bridge\\".[37][38]\\r\\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo was successful in passing legislation to name the bridge after his father, former Governor Mario Cuomo, on June 29, 2017.[39] This has been met with stiff criticism as a Reclaim New York Initiative poll of Rockland and Westchester county residents found only 14.7% of respondents support the new name.[40] Many have cited the timing of the New York State legislature vote at the last session before the summer term ended and the last chance to enact a state budget.[41] As of November 29, 2017, over 100,000 people have signed a Change.org petition called \\"Return the Cuomo Bridge its original name: The Tappan Zee. That bridge is our history.\\"[42][43]\\r\\nOn December 6, 2017, State Assemblyman Kevin Byrne, a Republican from Mahopac in Putnam County, announced that he would introduce legislation to revert the name of the bridge to \\"Malcolm Wilson Tappan Zee Bridge\\", after former Governor Malcolm Wilson.[44] The old Tappan Zee Bridge had been named for Wilson from 1994 to June 2017.[45]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading","input":"When did the new tappan zee bridge open?"},{"output":"holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension","context":"Blood plasma is a yellowish coloured liquid component of blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension; this makes plasma the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume.[1] It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (6ÿ8%) (i.e.serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen),[2] glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3?, Cl?, etc.), hormones, carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and oxygen. Plasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolytes in balanced form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.[3]\\r\\nBlood plasma is separated from the blood by spinning a tube of fresh blood containing an anticoagulant in a centrifuge until the blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube. The blood plasma is then poured or drawn off.[4] Blood plasma has a density of approximately 1025?kg/m3, or 1.025?g/ml.[5]\\r\\nBlood serum is blood plasma without clotting factors.[4]\\r\\nPlasmapheresis is a medical therapy that involves blood plasma extraction, treatment, and reintegration.\\r\\nFresh frozen plasma is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.[6] It is of critical importance in the treatment of many types of trauma which result in blood loss, and is therefore kept stocked universally in all medical facilities capable of treating trauma (ex. trauma centers, hospitals, and ambulances) or that pose a risk of patient blood loss such as surgical suite facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood plasma volume may be expanded by or drained to extravascular fluid when there are changes in Starling forces across capillary walls. For example, when blood pressure drops in circulatory shock, Starling forces drive fluid into the interstitium, causing third spacing.\\r\\nStanding still for a prolonged period will cause an increase in transcapillary hydrostatic pressure. As a result, approximately 12% of blood plasma volume will cross into the extravascular compartment. This causes an increase in hematocrit, serum total protein, blood viscosity and, as a result of increased concentration of coagulation factors, it causes orthostatic hypercoagulability.[7]\\r\\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \\"Dried plasmas\\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in World War II. Prior to the United States' involvement in the war, liquid plasma and whole blood were used.\\r\\nThe \\"Blood for Britain\\" program during the early 1940s was quite successful (and popular in the United States) based on Charles Drew's contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \\"Plasma for Britain\\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the test tube methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\\r\\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.[8] The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough distilled water to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.[9] The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.[10]\\r\\nFollowing the \\"Plasma for Britain\\" invention, Drew was named director of the Red Cross blood bank and assistant director of the National Research Council, in charge of blood collection for the United States Army and Navy. Drew argued against the armed forces directive that blood/plasma was to be separated by the race of the donor. Drew insisted that there was no racial difference in human blood and that the policy would lead to needless deaths as soldiers and sailors were required to wait for \\"same race\\" blood.[11]\\r\\nBy the end of the war the American Red Cross had provided enough blood for over six million plasma packages. Most of the surplus plasma was returned to the United States for civilian use. Serum albumin replaced dried plasma for combat use during the Korean War.[12]\\r\\nPlasma as a blood product prepared from blood donations is used in blood transfusions, typically as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or plasma Frozen Within 24 Hours After Phlebotomy (PF24). When donating whole blood or packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions, O- is the most desirable and is considered a \\"universal donor,\\" since it has neither A nor B antigens and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \\"universal recipient\\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through apheresis, as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \\"universal donor\\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.[13] However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.[14]\\r\\nFollowing fears of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began to import American plasma to meet its needs. In 2002, it purchased Life Resources Incorporated to be able to secure plasma supply from the United States.[15] The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK). It owned Bio Products Laboratory. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth S230?million.[16] The sale was met with criticism in the UK, over both the oversight of the company, and the impact on British blood needs. Confusion arose as some thought that the blood of British blood donors voluntarily donating to NHS Blood and Transplant Services would be sold for profit.[17] Currently, plasma donated in the United Kingdom is still not used due to concerns about vCJD, and is incinerated after component parts have been separated from it.[17][18]\\r\\nSimulated body fluid (SBF) is a solution having a similar ion concentration to that of human blood plasma. SBF is normally used for the surface modification of metallic implants, and more recently in gene delivery application.","input":"What is the use of plasma in blood?"},{"output":"President of the United States","context":"","input":"Who is the commander in chief of military?"},{"output":"The Green Bay Packers","context":"The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1899 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) with ten teams from four states, all of whom existed in some form as participants of regional leagues in their respective territories; it took on its current name in 1922. The NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts. Only two teams currently in the NFL, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are founding members.[1] The Green Bay Packers, founded 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921), is the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name in the same location.[2]\\r\\nLeague membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America Football Conference in 1950, two of which survive to the present day. By 1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.\\r\\nThe rival American Football League was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts has helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball was first professionalized in 1892, when William Heffelfinger and Ben \\"Sport\\" Donnelly each received a large sum of cash to play for the Allegheny Athletic Association of the Western Pennsylvania Senior Independent Football Conference. Through the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century, professional football was primarily a regional sport, with most informal circuits centered around a single state or region with only limited play outside state lines. There were no national leagues or tournaments for the professional game, despite numerous attempts: an earlier National Football League (backed by what would become Major League Baseball) was unable to expand beyond Pennsylvania in 1902, the New York City-based World Series of Pro Football tournament disbanded after two seasons and lack of fan interest, and other attempts to either combine existing circuits or create new ones from scratch never materialized.\\r\\nBy the late 1910s, the regional circuits had coalesced into more or less leagues of varying degrees of organization. One of the most prominent at the time was the Ohio League, which boasted the services of legendary Native American athlete Jim Thorpe, among other stars. Another was the somewhat lower-caliber, but better-organized, New York Pro Championship; two of the New York circuit's best teams, the Rochester Jeffersons and the Buffalo All-Stars, went on a barnstorming tour of Ohio in 1917. After the Jeffersons played, and lost badly to, Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs in a 1917 match, Jeffersons owner Leo Lyons (believing that the foundation of a league could build a sport that rivaled baseball, which then held an effective monopoly on professional sport, in popularity) suggested to Thorpe that a league be formed.[3]\\r\\nLyons' vision of a national league of existing football clubs (which, at the time, was competing with another proposed league, again backed by baseball) was cut short by the United States' entry into World War I and further hampered by a flu pandemic in 1918, which forced most of the Ohio League teams to suspend operations due to either travel restrictions or loss of players to the war effort. New York's teams, although they were forced to reduce their schedules, continued and (along with the few other remaining teams that survived the suspension, including the OL's Dayton Triangles and Michigan's Detroit Heralds) picked up many of the stars that remained stateside. This had the effect of spreading out the talent across a broader geographic area. Over the course of 1919, as professional football had increased in parity, teams began reaching out and participating in more barnstorming tours. By then, two informal but distinct interstate circuits had developed: one around the Eastern Seaboard (particularly New York City, New Jersey and Philadelphia) that played mostly on Saturdays due to blue laws, and another centered around the Midwestern region (Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, and upstate New York) that played on Sundays. It was the latter that formed the basis of what would eventually become the modern National Football League.\\r\\nOhio's teams went along with the idea in the face of escalating costs: several bidding wars in the early 1900s, both in Pennsylvania and Ohio, had damaged the sport significantly, and another bidding war was about to erupt if something was not done. By forming a national league, teams reasoned that it would eliminate the practices of looting other teams' rosters and concentrating top talent in only a few teams, thus distributing talent more evenly and efficiently thereby reducing costs for each individual team while still keeping a top-level product on the field.\\r\\nOn August 20, 1920, at a Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, the league was formalized, originally as the American Professional Football Conference, initially consisting only of the Ohio League teams, although some of the teams declined participation.[4] One month later on September 17, the league was renamed the American Professional Football Association, adding Buffalo and Rochester from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), and several other teams from nearby circuits. The eleven founding teams initially struck an agreement over player poaching and the declaration of an end-of-season champion. Thorpe, while still playing for the Bulldogs, was elected president. Only four of the founding teams finished the 1920 schedule and the undefeated Akron Pros claimed the first championship. Membership of the league increased to 22 teams ÿ including more of the New York teams ÿ in 1921, but throughout the 1920s the membership was unstable and the league was not a major national sport. On June 24, 1922, the organization, now headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, changed its title a final time to the National Football League.[5]\\r\\nTwo charter members, the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) and the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears), are still in existence. The Green Bay Packers franchise, founded in 1919, is the oldest team not to change locations, but did not begin league play until 1921. The New York Football Giants joined in 1925, followed by the Portsmouth Spartans in 1930, relocating to Detroit in 1934 to become the Lions.[6] The Indianapolis Colts franchise traces its history through several predecessors, including one of the league's founding teams ÿ the Dayton Triangles ÿ but is considered a separate franchise from those teams and was founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953. Although the original NFL teams representing Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit no longer exist, replacement franchises have since been established for those cities.\\r\\nEarly championships were awarded to the team with the best won-lost record, initially rather haphazardly, as some teams played more or fewer games than others, or scheduled games against non-league, amateur or collegiate teams; this led to the title being decided on a tiebreaker in 1921, a disputed title in 1925, and the scheduling of an impromptu indoor playoff game in 1932. The lack of a firm league structure meant that numerous teams regularly were added and removed from the league each year; a franchise owner might trade in his franchise in one city for one in another (as was the case with the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs and Detroit Wolverines), and if a larger-market or more established team wanted a player on a smaller-market upstart, it could buy out the team outright and fold it to gain rights to that player, as the New York Giants did to the Wolverines in 1928 to get Benny Friedman.\\r\\nIn league meetings prior to the 1933 season, three new teams, the Pirates, the Cincinnati Reds and the Eagles, were admitted to the NFL.[7][8] Ten teams were then in the NFL and, at George Preston Marshall's urging, with Halas' support, NFL was reorganized into an Eastern Division and a Western Division. In the Eastern Division were the Philadelphia Eagles, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Redskins, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the Western Division were the Chicago Bears, Portsmouth Spartans, Chicago Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and the Cincinnati Reds. Furthermore, the two owners convinced the league to have the two division winners meet in a NFL Championship Game.[9]\\r\\nBy 1934, all of the small-town teams, with the exception of the Green Bay Packers, had moved to or been replaced by teams in big cities, and even Green Bay had begun to play a portion of its home schedule in much larger Milwaukee for more support (a practice they continued well into the 1990s). In 1941, the corporate headquarters moved from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago. During the early years of the league, rather than coming up with original team names, many NFL teams simply chose the name of the Major League Baseball team in the same city. Thus the Pittsburgh Steelers were the \\"Pittsburgh Pirates\\" for the first seven years of existence and other teams such as the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Buffalo Bisons all represented the NFL at one time or another.[10]\\r\\nAn annual draft of college players was first held in 1936.[11][12] The first televised NFL game was on October 22, 1939 in a game the Eagles lost 23-14 to the host Dodgers at Ebbets Field.[13][14] It was during this era, however, that the NFL became segregated: there were no black players in professional football in the United States between 1933 and 1945, mainly due to the influence of George Preston Marshall, who entered the league in 1932 as the owner of the Boston Braves. Other NFL owners emulated Marshall's whites-only policy to mollify southern fans, and even after the NFL's color barrier had been broken in the 1950s, Marshall's Washington Redskins remained all-white until forced to integrate by the Kennedy administration in 1962.[15] Despite his bigotry, Marshall was selected as a charter member of the NFL-inspired Pro Football Hall of Fame, primarily for the numerous innovations (fixed schedules, separate conferences and championship games) Marshall encouraged during his time in the league.\\r\\nCollege football was the bigger attraction, but by the end of World War II, pro football began to rival the college game for fans' attention. Rule changes and innovations such as the T formation led to a faster-paced, higher-scoring game. The league also expanded out of its eastern and midwestern cradle; in 1945, the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles, becoming the first big-league sports franchise on the West Coast.[16] In 1950, the NFL accepted three teams ÿ the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts ÿ from the defunct All-America Football Conference, expanding to thirteen clubs. For a three-month period in 1950 the league was renamed the National-American Football League, that was subsequently changed back.[17][18] In 1958, the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants played \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" for the championship. Being the first nationally televised football game, along with its thrilling ending greatly increased the popularity of the NFL. Through these breakthroughs, pro football finally earned its place as a major sport.\\r\\nThe NFL's precursor, the American Professional Football Association, had several minority players, including African-American players: between 1920 and 1926, nine black players suited up for NFL squads. It was also common, due to the number of talented players that were produced by the Carlisle Indian School's football team, to see teams (both inside and outside the NFL) openly market Native Americans; in fact, the Oorang Indians of 1922 to 1923 consisted entirely of Native American talent. Running back Walter Achiu and quarterback Arthur Matsu, both of the Dayton Triangles, were the first Asian-American players in the NFL, having joined the league in 1927 and 1928 respectively. Ignacio Molinet and Jess Rodriguez were the first Hispanic players in the NFL and each played one season in 1927 and 1929 respectively.\\r\\nHowever, since Carlisle had closed in 1918, the talent pool of Indians had dried up. Meanwhile, all black players in the NFL (including future Hall of Famer Fritz Pollard) were summarily kicked out prior to the 1927 season for reasons unexplained. From 1928 to 1932, no more than one black player could be found in the league each season, and none played more than two seasons. In 1933, there were two: Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Lillard was kicked off the Chicago Cardinals for fighting, while Kemp left to pursue what would become a successful coaching career. The moves left the league as all-white, and Boston Redskins owner George Preston Marshall allegedly used his pressure to keep it that way for the next several years, though each team's internal politics and cronyism, as well as the rising tide of racism in the United States as a whole, also played a significant role. Even during the wartime years, when much of the NFL's talent was overseas fighting World War II, players such as Kenny Washington who stayed in the United States were still passed up in favor of white players with normally debilitating medical conditions such as partial blindness.[citation needed]\\r\\nNFL integration occurred only when the Cleveland Rams wanted to move to Los Angeles, and the venue, the Los Angeles Coliseum, required them to integrate their team. They then signed two black players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.[19] Other NFL teams eventually followed suit, but Marshall refused to integrate the Redskins until forced to by the Kennedy administration as a pre-condition for using D.C. Stadium (now RFK Stadium). In spite of this open bias, Marshall was elected to the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. In 1946, the Cleveland Browns of a rival Professional Football league, the All-America Football Conference, signed two black players. By 1960, the NFL's new competitor, the American Football League, actively recruited players from smaller predominantly black colleges that had been largely ignored by the NFL, giving those schools' black players the opportunity to play professional football. Early AFL teams averaged more blacks than did their NFL counterparts.[20]\\r\\nHowever, despite the NFL's previous segregationist policies, the clear competitive advantage of AFL teams with liberal signing policies affected the NFL's drafts. By 1969, a comparison of the two leagues' championship team photos showed the AFL's Chiefs with 23?black players out of 51?players (45%) pictured, while the NFL's Vikings had 11?blacks, of 42?players (26%) in the photo. Chiefs players have been quoted as saying that one motivating factor in their defeat of the Vikings in Super Bowl IV was their pride in their diverse squad. Recent surveys have shown that the current, post-merger NFL is approximately 67ÿ71% non-white (this includes African Americans, Polynesians, non-white Hispanics, Asians, and people that are mixed race), significantly higher than the national average; certain positions, such as cornerback and running back, are almost entirely black.\\r\\nIn 1946, after World War II, the struggling league had headquarters in Chicago. Commissioner Elmer Layden could not handle the pressure of the AFL set up in the same year. DeBenneville Bert Bell was hired to be the commissioner, and he accepted the office only on condition that the headquarters would move to Philadelphia.[21] Bell had played for the Eagles, and for Penn before that. Till 1959, when he died of a heart attack at SteelersÿEagles game at Franklin Field, the headquarters of NFL were on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, and Bert Bell had transformed the NFL into a commercial and popular success. Within a short period of his death, the NFL offices were moved to Manhattan, where they remain to this day. The NFL held a monopoly on professional football in the United States for most of the 1950s, a rare occurrence for a league that had at least one competing league in every year since 1934. By 1960, a group of potential professional football owners that would become known as the Foolish Club had become frustrated with their efforts to buy into the NFL (some were NFL franchise minority owners such as Harry Wismer and Ralph Wilson; others, such as Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams, had tried but failed to buy NFL teams) and formed a new league, the American Football League. It was the eighth professional football league to use the name and the fourth to be universally considered a major-league competitor to the NFL. The AFL would prove to be the NFL's most formidable challenger to date.\\r\\nBy the middle of the 1960s competition for players, including separate college drafts, was driving up player salaries. In 1965, in the most high-profile such contest and a major boost to the AFL, University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath signed with the New York Jets rather than the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals for a then-record $427,000. In 1966, the NFL's New York Giants broke an informal agreement and signed placekicker Pete Gogolak, who was under contract to the AFL's Buffalo Bills. Then AFL Commissioner Al Davis embarked on a campaign to sign players away from the NFL, especially quarterbacks, but behind the scenes a number of NFL team owners began action to end the detrimental rivalry.\\r\\nSeveral NFL franchises led by Cowboys General Manager Tex Schramm asked to meet with AFL owners to negotiate a merger. In an agreement brokered by Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt, the two leagues announced their merger deal on June 8, 1966. The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end-of-season World Championship Game between the two league champions (later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game). Still another city received an NFL franchise thanks to the AFL, as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana's federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89-800, which permitted the merger and exempted the action from Anti-Trust restrictions. The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress. In 1970, the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams. Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL, three NFL teams ÿ the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and Baltimore Colts ÿ moved to the AFC, the conference containing the AFL teams. Two other teams, the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were also added to the NFL as part of the merger agreement. (These two teams were not added until 1976; during the early 1970s, there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL, and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities. Once the Bills and Patriots built new stadiums and solidified their place in their home markets, the NFL awarded Seattle and Tampa Bay expansion franchises of their own.) There was also a financial settlement, with the AFL teams paying a combined $18 million over 20 years.\\r\\nAlthough the AFL's identity was subsumed by the NFL, the NFL eventually adopted many of the AFL's innovations including the on-field game clock, names on player jerseys, recruiting at small and predominantly black colleges, gate and television revenue-sharing, establishment of southern franchises, and more wide-open offensive rules.\\r\\nUnlike previous armed conflicts such as World War I and World War II, both of which effectively stopped or dramatically reduced the amount of professional football played in the United States, both the AFL and NFL were largely unaffected by the Vietnam War and did not lose a significant number of players to the war draft. There is at least one recorded incidence of the NFL using champagne units to keep its players from being sent overseas (the Dallas Cowboys used the Texas Air National Guard's 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, a well-known champagne unit to shield seven Cowboys players from combat in Vietnam).[22] Bob Kalsu, then a player with the AFL's Buffalo Bills, left the team to serve in Vietnam and died in combat; he was the only casualty of the Vietnam War that the league would sustain. (Don Steinbrunner, who briefly played for the Cleveland Browns, also died in Vietnam, but he left the NFL over a decade before his deployment there.)\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the NFL solidified its dominance as America's top spectator sport,[citation needed] and its important role in American culture. The Super Bowl became an unofficial national holiday and the top-rated TV program most years. Monday Night Football, which first aired in 1970, brought in high ratings by mixing sports and entertainment. Rule changes in the late 1970s ensured a fast-paced game with lots of passing to attract the casual fan.\\r\\nThe World Football League was the first post-merger challenge to the NFL's dominance, and in 1974, successfully lured some top NFL talent to its league and prompted a few rules changes in the NFL. However, financial problems led the league to fold halfway through its 1975 season. Two teams, the Birmingham Vulcans and Memphis Southmen, made unsuccessful efforts to move from the WFL to the NFL.\\r\\nThe founding of the United States Football League in the early 1980s would prove to be the longest sustained challenge to the NFL's dominance since the 1970 merger, lasting three seasons. The USFL was a relatively well-financed competitor with big-name players and a national television contract, but overspending on that talent and a decision to move its niche spring operation into a head-to-head competition with the NFL in the fall (abandoning some of its biggest cities in the process) over the objections of many of its original owners were two major factors in the league's demise. The league's last-ditch effort to sue the NFL for hundreds of millions of dollars in antitrust damages, while a technical victory, failed to secure the funds the USFL needed to survive.\\r\\n2001 saw the establishment of the XFL, an attempt by Vince McMahon and NBC, which had lost the NFL broadcast rights for that year, to compete with the league; the XFL folded after just one season.[23] Unlike the WFL and USFL, the XFL had no impact on the NFL's rules or franchise locations (its attempts at innovations were often ridiculed, though one innovation, the above the field Skycam which originated in the XFL, became a regular part of NFL telecasts), but a few NFL players used the XFL to relaunch their careers.\\r\\nThe United Football League, which began play in 2009, had originally planned to take a direct challenge to the NFL with NFL-comparable salaries and teams in New York City and Los Angeles, but the UFL never did play in those cities (an ostensibly New York team played in Long Island and New Jersey), cut back its salaries, and instead opted for a complementary approach with teams in cities such as Las Vegas, Sacramento and Omaha; after four years, the UFL folded due to massive financial losses. Numerous other leagues have attempted to form over the years, but none have succeeded in having any level of competition comparable to the NFL (most never made it to their first game).\\r\\nOn August 31, 2007, a story in USA Today unveiled the first changes to the league's shield logo since 1980, which took effect with the 2008 season.[24] The redesign reduced the number of stars in the logo from 25[24] (which were found not to have a meaning beyond being decorative) to eight (for each of the league's divisions), repositioned the football in the manner of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and changed the NFL letters to a straight, serifed font. The redesign was created with television and digital media, along with clothing, in mind. The shield logo itself dates back to the 1940s.\\r\\nIn 1987, through a short stint with NBC Sports, Gayle Sierens became the first woman to do play-by-play for an NFL regular season football game when she called the December 27 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Kansas City Chiefs. She was originally to be a regular play-by-play announcer for the season, but a contract dispute with WFLA prevented her from continuing in that role beyond her lone game.[25] In May 2017, Beth Mowins was reported by Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch to be the chosen play-by-play announcer on ESPN's Monday Night Football opening week late broadcast between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos.[26] She did that announcing job in September of that year, and thus became the first woman to call a nationally televised NFL game.[27]\\r\\nShannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, in a pre-season matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the San Diego Chargers.[28] In 2015 Sarah Thomas became the first full-time female official in NFL history.[29]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2013, Lauren Silberman became the first woman to ever try out for the NFL when she appeared as a kicker at the NFL Regional Scouting Combine in Florham Park, New Jersey.[30][31] However, after two poor kicks, Silberman left the field, citing an injury to her quadriceps; the tryout was suspected by members of the press and public as being nothing more than a publicity stunt.[32] Olympic pole-vaulter Jenn Suhr publicly expressed interest in attending an NFL scouting combine in 2014, and at least one team (the Buffalo Bills) acknowledged Suhr's interest favorably but did not invite her to a combine; Suhr did not indicate what position she would play.[33]\\r\\nOn July 27, 2015, the Arizona Cardinals hired Jennifer Welter as an assistant coaching intern for training camp and the preseason; as such, she is believed to be the first female coach in the NFL.[34][35] The Buffalo Bills hired Kathryn Smith as an assistant special teams coach for the 2016 season; thus Smith, who had long served as an assistant and front office staffer, became the first full-time female assistant coach in the NFL.[36][37] In 2017, Katie Sowers became an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers; later that year, while still working in that job, she came out as gay, thus becoming the NFL's first openly LGBT coach, and the first openly LGBT coach in all of U.S. men's professional sports.[38][39]\\r\\nWhile there have been a scattering of American professional female football players in semi-pro football (Patricia Palinkas, Katie Hnida, and the still active Julie Harshbarger among them) and female players in American college and high school football, no woman with prior experience as an American football player has attempted to make an NFL roster.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent years, the NFL has expanded into new markets and ventures outside of the United States, beginning with a regular series of exhibition games known as the American Bowl, then with a European-based developmental league culminating in the now defunct NFL Europa, and starting in 2005 the league began hosting regular season games outside the United States, the first in Mexico City, Mexico, and then from 2007 hosting games in London, England, and from 2008 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\r\\nThe American Bowl games began in 1986 and continued until 2005 at various sites in countries around the world. Then in 1991, the league formed the World League of American Football, later known as NFL Europe and still later as NFL Europa, a developmental league that had teams in Britain, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. The NFL shut down the program in June 2007.\\r\\nThe league played a regular-season NFL game in Mexico City in 2005, the first-ever NFL regular season game held outside the United States, and marketed across the league as the F~tbol Americano game. On October 28, 2007, a regular season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants was held outside of North America for the first time in Wembley Stadium, the 90,000-seat national stadium, in London. It was a financial success with nearly 40,000 tickets sold within ninety minutes of the start of sales,[40] and a game-day attendance of over 80,000. In 2008, the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers played at Wembley,[41] and in October 2009, the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers met.[42] In 2010, it was the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers that played in London. Starting from the 2008ÿ09 season, building on league links with Toronto, the Buffalo Bills play an annual home game in Toronto's Rogers Centre, marketed by the team as the Bills Toronto Series.[43] In 2014, the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons played at Wembley Stadium. In 2016, the Raiders and Texans played a game in Estadio Azteca, Mexico. The Raiders and Patriots will play here in 2017.\\r\\nAfter 100 years of American football influence in Mexican territory, in 1998 the NFL opened a representation office in Mexico, called NFL Mxico, as the NFL identified Mexico as a key market outside the United States due to proximity and tradition. The Mexican office handles sponsorship, licensing, detail dealers, sport culture, broadcasting, public relationships and community service.[44]\\r\\nIn the early years, the league was not stable and teams moved frequently. Franchise mergers were popular during World War II in response to the scarcity of players. An example of this was the Steagles, temporarily formed as a merger between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles.\\r\\nFranchise moves became far more controversial in the late twentieth century when a vastly more popular NFL was free from financial instability and allowed many franchises to abandon long-held strongholds for perceived financially greener pastures. This was done in spite of the promises to Congress by Pete Rozelle in 1966 that if the AFLÿNFL merger were allowed, no city would lose its franchise. Those promises were made to ensure passage of PL 89-800, which granted anti-trust immunity to the merged professional football leagues. While owners invariably cited financial difficulties as the primary factor in such moves, many fans bitterly disputed these contentions, especially in Cleveland (the Rams and the Browns), Baltimore (the Colts), Houston (the Oilers), and St. Louis (the Cardinals), each of which eventually received teams some years after their original franchises left (the Browns, another Browns, Ravens, Texans, and Rams, respectively). Notably, the second-largest media market in the United States, Los Angeles, did not have an NFL team from 1994, after both the Raiders and the Rams relocated elsewhere, until 2016, when the Rams returned. The San Diego Chargers, who played their inaugural season in Los Angeles before spending the next 55 years in San Diego, returned to Los Angeles following the 2016 season. The Oakland Raiders (who themselves relocated to Los Angeles for a time in the 1980s and early 1990s) have a pending relocation to Las Vegas, Nevada that will take effect in 2019 or 2020. The driving force behind the 2010s relocations was not directly related to finances, as the league was lucrative and stable by this point; instead, the promise of better stadiums drove those relocations.\\r\\nWhile baseball is known as \\"America's national pastime,\\" football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States. According to the Harris Poll, professional football moved ahead of baseball as the fans' favorite in 1965, during the emergence of the NFL's challenger, the American Football League, as a major professional football league. Football has remained America's favorite sport ever since. In a Harris Poll conducted in 2008, the NFL was the favorite sport of as many people (30%) as the combined total of the next three professional sports ÿ baseball (15%), auto racing (10%), and hockey (5%).[45] Additionally, football's American television viewership ratings now surpass those of other sports, although football season comprises far fewer games than the seasons of other sports.[46]\\r\\nHowever, the Harris Poll only allows one unaided selection of a \\"favorite sport.\\" Other studies and polls such as the ESPN Sports Poll and the studies released by the Associated Press (AP) and conducted by Sports Marketing Group (SMG) from 1988 to 2004, show far higher levels of popularity for NFL football since they list from thirty to over 100 sports that each respondent must rate. According to the AP, the SMG polls from 1988 to 2004 show NFL football to be the most popular spectator sport in America. The AP stated that \\"In the most detailed survey ever of America's sports tastes\\" researching \\"114 spectator sports they might attend, follow on television or radio or read about in newspapers or magazines, the NFL topped all sports with 39 percent of Americans saying they loved it or considered it one of their favorites.\\"[47] In a 2003 study conducted by SMG and released by the AP, the NFL was loved or liked a lot by 42.8% of Americans over 18.[48][49]\\r\\nThe NFL has the highest per-game attendance of any domestic professional sports league in the world. The NFL's overall attendance, however, is only approximately 20 percent of Major League Baseball, because of the latter's longer schedule (162-game scheduled regular season).[50]\\r\\nA 2007 Turnkey Sports & Entertainment's Team Brand Index for \\"team loyalty\\" ranked NFL teams in twelve of the top twenty-five spots out of 122 total between the four major sports leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers and their fanbase had the top spot, while the New England Patriots, and Indianapolis Colts had the following two spots, followed by the New Orleans Saints at number seven and the Green Bay Packers and their fanbase ranked at number ten.[51] The Arizona Cardinals finished last in the entire survey of 122 teams, though the survey was taken before the team's appearance against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII.\\r\\nThe National Anthem controversy was started by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick knelt during the National Anthem in protest of Americas treatment of minorities. [52] In October 2017, Papa John's Pizza removed the \\"official sponsor\\" designation on their television advertising over disagreements with how the NFL handled the National Anthem protests.[53]\\r\\nBuffalo Bills\\r\\nMiami Dolphins\\r\\nNew England Patriots\\r\\nNew York Jets\\r\\nBaltimore Ravens\\r\\nCincinnati Bengals\\r\\nCleveland Browns\\r\\nPittsburgh Steelers\\r\\nHouston Texans\\r\\nIndianapolis Colts\\r\\nJacksonville Jaguars\\r\\nTennessee Titans\\r\\nDenver Broncos\\r\\nKansas City Chiefs\\r\\nLos Angeles Chargers\\r\\nOakland Raiders\\r\\nDallas Cowboys\\r\\nNew York Giants\\r\\nPhiladelphia Eagles\\r\\nWashington Redskins\\r\\nChicago Bears\\r\\nDetroit Lions\\r\\nGreen Bay Packers\\r\\nMinnesota Vikings\\r\\nAtlanta Falcons\\r\\nCarolina Panthers\\r\\nNew Orleans Saints\\r\\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\\r\\nArizona Cardinals\\r\\nLos Angeles Rams\\r\\nSan Francisco 49ers\\r\\nSeattle Seahawks","input":"What is the oldest football team in the nfl?"},{"output":"Rachel Hughes","context":"Christopher Francis \\"Chris\\" Tate is a fictional character from the British ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, played by Peter Amory. The character made his first appearance on 14 November 1989, when he arrived in the village alongside the rest of the Tate family - his father Frank, stepmother Kim and younger sister, Zoe. Initially, Chris was a good man who ran his business fairly, but was left permanently resentful of his life when he was maimed in a plane crash in 1993, which left him paralyzed from the waist down. The character then became much more jaded and bitter, often using his intelligence and assets to exact revenge on those he perceived to have hurt him. The resulting disabilities he was left with made him realize that his wife Kathy only remained with him to fulfill the role of his carer, leading to their divorce. He went on to marry Rachel Hughes in 1995, but his growing lust for money and indifference for everyone else's feelings lead to marital breakdown and divorce. Chris then married former prostitute Charity Dingle in 2001, despite a 12-year age gap and the disapproval of Zoe, but Charity's selfishness and cheating behaviour ultimately lead to the deterioration of their relationship. Chris soon learned he had an inoperable brain tumour, and rather than wait to die, decided to take revenge on Charity. After ensuring Charity would be left with nothing, he made his final appearance on 18 September 2003, when he committed suicide so as to frame her for his murder. Although Charity claimed she was sorry, Chris's last words consisted of a tirade of insults towards her, before the poison he had taken killed him.\\r\\nChris first appeared in November 1989 when his father Frank and stepmother Kim bought Home Farm. He was the managing director of his father's haulage firm. He had owned a flat in Skipdale, but moved into Home Farm soon afterwards to be closer to love interest Kathy Merrick. He had a tense relationship with his father Frank Tate (Norman Bowler), partly due to the death of Chris's mother Jean, who had died five years ago from cancer, and Frank's remarriage to his secretary Kim, who was only a few years older than Chris and had been having an affair with Frank whilst Jean was ill. Despite the turbulence between father and son, Chris was close to his younger sister, Zoe Tate. When Frank admitted he had helped Jean die when she was terminally ill, Chris initially accused Frank and Kim of plotting his mother's death. Chris was also unimpressed when Kim persuaded Frank to have an operation to reverse his vasectomy.\\r\\nChris and Kathy began dating and Chris wrote a song for Kathy to sing at a village concert, 'Just This Side of Love' (which was released as a single sung by Malandra Burrows). They briefly split up over Chris's gambling habits after he lost his motorbike in a poker match to Alan Turner, but reunite and marry on 5 November 1991. The marriage began to break down a year later when Chris found out Kathy knew that Kim was having an affair with village toff Rt. Hon. Neil Kincaid (Brian Deacon). In the row that follows, Chris nearly hit Kathy, and later confides in Zoe that he is worried that he has inherited their father's temper. He also admitted that although he wanted children, Kathy didn't. When former alcoholic Frank relapses into drinking again, Chris sees an opportunity to gain control of the business by buying Kim's shares, mortgaging his and Kathy's cottage to do so, Kathy only finding out when Frank confronts her. As it turned out, Zoe joined forces with Frank to vote down Chris. Kathy, angry at his actions, begins an affair with American wine merchant Josh Lewis (Peter Warnock), and plans to leave Chris.\\r\\nOn 30 December 1993, Chris spent the evening in Skipdale with a friend, unaware Kathy was planning to leave him that night. He was supposed to pick up Kathy and meet Zoe in the Woolpack but went straight to the pub and was there when a plane crashed into the village. Chris was trapped in the wreckage of the wine bar with his family thinking he was still in Skipdale. He was eventually discovered by Kathy's lover, Josh, and was dug out overnight. He suffered spinal injuries and was left paraplegic.\\r\\nChris was very bitter about being disabled and realised that Kathy was only with him out of duty. He formed a bond with Rachel Hughes, whose brother, Mark, died in the plane crash, and she began giving him swimming lessons. The friendship became an affair and Kathy found out when she saw them kissing on their third wedding anniversary. When Kathy found out Rachel was expecting Chris's child, she threw Chris out of his wheelchair.\\r\\nRachel went into labour prematurely after discovering that her stepfather Joe Sugden had died. She gave birth to a baby boy named Joseph Mark after her stepfather and brother. Chris and Rachel soon fell out with Frank over his interference with Joseph.\\r\\nChris and Rachel got married on 7 December 1995 with only Jack and Sarah Sugden as witnesses. The marriage lasted less than a year because of Chris's increasingly selfish and money-grabbing ways. Rachel later died, leaving Chris custody of Joseph.\\r\\nWhen Frank died of a heart attack in 1997. Chris was convinced that Kim had killed him. Kim admitted to Chris that she had watched his father die. When Chris tried to blackmail her into giving him custody of his half-brother James, Kim hit Chris over the head and tipped him out of his wheelchair, pouring whisky over him before escaping with James by helicopter.\\r\\nIn 1999, Chris was held hostage by an employee, Liam, who revealed that he was Frank's illegitimate son and Chris's half-brother. Chris eventually formed a bond with Liam and was upset when he was shot dead by Zoe 'rescuing' Chris\\r\\nIn 2001 Chris married for a third time, to prostitute Charity Dingle. However, Zoe didn't like Charity and told Charity it was because of her history, but it soon transpired that Zoe fancied Charity herself. She offered Charity money to leave Chris and Charity responded by kissing her. The two then famously had a lesbian affair, which lasted for several months. Charity became alarmed by Zoe's obsessive behaviour and tried to end the fling, but Zoe secretly recorded Charity confessing to the affair on tape and blackmailed her into signing a prenuptial agreement, so she would always have a hold over her. Charity then confessed all to Chris, and he surprised her by forgiving her and ripping up the prenup. He later forgave Zoe after she was diagonised with Schizophrenia.\\r\\nIn 2003 Chris discovered that Charity had had a baby when she was 13 and given it up adoption, after Emily and Paddy Kirk's 13-year-old foster child Debbie Jones claimed she was Charity's daughter. He was shocked to discover that Debbie's father was Charity's cousin Cain Dingle. In later 2003 he threw Charity out after discovering that she had been having an affair with Cain. Learning that he had an inoperable brain tumour and only months to live, Chris began frittering away all his money to ensure Charity would be left with nothing. He said a tearful goodbye to Zoe and Joseph and then arranged a meeting with Charity where he poisoned himself in order to frame his wife for his murder. He died on the floor of Home Farm in the same spot where his father had died six years previously. His last word was 'whore'.\\r\\nIn 2017, Chris's son Joseph Tate returns to the village under the false name Tom Waterhouse to take revenge on Charity Dingle","input":"Who was chris tate's wife in emmerdale farm?"},{"output":"hypothalamus","context":"The hypothalamus (from Greek ??, \\"under\\" and Ĳ?ϫ?, thalamus) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis).\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the limbic system.[1] In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is the size of an almond.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, called releasing hormones or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst,[2] fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is a brain structure made up of distinct nuclei as well as less anatomically distinct areas. It is found in all vertebrate nervous systems. In mammals, magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus produce neurohypophysial hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are released into the blood in the posterior pituitary.[3] Much smaller parvocellular neurosecretory cells, neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, release corticotropin-releasing hormone and other hormones into the hypophyseal portal system, where these hormones diffuse to the anterior pituitary.\\r\\nThe hypothalamic nuclei include the following:[4][5][6]\\r\\nSee also: ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, periventricular nucleus.\\r\\nA cross section of the monkey hypothalamus displays 2 of the major hypothalamic nuclei on either side of the fluid-filled 3rd ventricle.\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei\\r\\nHypothalamic nuclei on one side of the hypothalamus, shown in a 3-D computer reconstruction[10]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system, in particular the brainstem and its reticular formation. As part of the limbic system, it has connections to other limbic structures including the amygdala and septum, and is also connected with areas of the autonomous nervous system.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus receives many inputs from the brainstem, the most notable from the nucleus of the solitary tract, the locus coeruleus, and the ventrolateral medulla.\\r\\nMost nerve fibres within the hypothalamus run in two ways (bidirectional).\\r\\nSeveral hypothalamic nuclei are sexually dimorphic; i.e., there are clear differences in both structure and function between males and females.[citation needed]\\r\\nSome differences are apparent even in gross neuroanatomy: most notable is the sexually dimorphic nucleus within the preoptic area. However most of the differences are subtle changes in the connectivity and chemical sensitivity of particular sets of neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe importance of these changes can be recognized by functional differences between males and females. For instance, males of most species prefer the odor and appearance of females over males, which is instrumental in stimulating male sexual behavior. If the sexually dimorphic nucleus is lesioned, this preference for females by males diminishes. Also, the pattern of secretion of growth hormone is sexually dimorphic, and this is one reason why in many species, adult males are much larger than females.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther striking functional dimorphisms are in the behavioral responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nEstrogen and progesterone can influence gene expression in particular neurons or induce changes in cell membrane potential and kinase activation, leading to diverse non-genomic cellular functions. Estrogen and progesterone bind to their cognate nuclear hormone receptors, which translocate to the cell nucleus and interact with regions of DNA known as hormone response elements (HREs) or get tethered to another transcription factor's binding site. Estrogen receptor (ER) has been shown to transactivate other transcription factors in this manner, despite the absence of an estrogen response element (ERE) in the proximal promoter region of the gene. In general, ERs and progesterone receptors (PRs) are gene activators, with increased mRNA and subsequent protein synthesis following hormone exposure.[citation needed]\\r\\nMale and female brains differ in the distribution of estrogen receptors, and this difference is an irreversible consequence of neonatal steroid exposure. Estrogen receptors (and progesterone receptors) are found mainly in neurons in the anterior and mediobasal hypothalamus, notably:[citation needed]\\r\\nIn neonatal life, gonadal steroids influence the development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn primates, the developmental influence of androgens is less clear, and the consequences are less understood. Within the brain, testosterone is aromatized to (estradiol), which is the principal active hormone for developmental influences. The human testis secretes high levels of testosterone from about week 8 of fetal life until 5ÿ6 months after birth (a similar perinatal surge in testosterone is observed in many species), a process that appears to underlie the male phenotype. Estrogen from the maternal circulation is relatively ineffective, partly because of the high circulating levels of steroid-binding proteins in pregnancy.[citation needed]\\r\\nSex steroids are not the only important influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor.[11] Unlike gonadal steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus has a central neuroendocrine function, most notably by its control of the anterior pituitary, which in turn regulates various endocrine glands and organs. Releasing hormones (also called releasing factors) are produced in hypothalamic nuclei then transported along axons to either the median eminence or the posterior pituitary, where they are stored and released as needed.[12]\\r\\nIn the hypothalamicÿadenohypophyseal axis, releasing hormones, also known as hypophysiotropic or hypothalamic hormones, are released from the median eminence, a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the hypophyseal portal system, which carries them to the anterior pituitary where they exert their regulatory functions on the secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones.[13] These hypophysiotropic hormones are stimulated by parvocellular neurosecretory cells located in the periventricular area of the hypothalamus. After their release into the capillaries of the third ventricle, the hypophysiotropic hormones travel through what is known as the hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation. Once they reach their destination in the anterior pituitary, these hormones bind to specific receptors located on the surface of pituitary cells. Depending on which cells are activated through this binding, the pituitary will either begin secreting or stop secreting hormones into the rest of the bloodstream. (Bear, Mark F. \\"Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary.\\" Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain. 4th ed. Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer, 2016. 528. Print.)\\r\\nOther hormones secreted from the median eminence include vasopressin, oxytocin, and neurotensin.[15][16][17][18]\\r\\nIn the hypothalamic-neurohypophyseal axis, neurohypophysial hormones are released from the posterior pituitary, which is actually a prolongation of the hypothalamus, into the circulation.\\r\\nIt is also known that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) hormones are related to certain skin diseases and skin homeostasis. There is evidence linking hyperactivity of HPA hormones to stress-related skin diseases and skin tumors.[19]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus coordinates many hormonal and behavioural circadian rhythms, complex patterns of neuroendocrine outputs, complex homeostatic mechanisms, and important behaviours. The hypothalamus must, therefore, respond to many different signals, some of which generated externally and some internally. Delta wave signalling arising either in the thalamus or in the cortex influences the secretion of releasing hormones; GHRH and prolactin are stimulated whilst TRH is inhibited.\\r\\nThe hypothalamus is responsive to:\\r\\nOlfactory stimuli are important for sexual reproduction and neuroendocrine function in many species. For instance if a pregnant mouse is exposed to the urine of a 'strange' male during a critical period after coitus then the pregnancy fails (the Bruce effect). Thus, during coitus, a female mouse forms a precise 'olfactory memory' of her partner that persists for several days. Pheromonal cues aid synchronization of oestrus in many species; in women, synchronized menstruation may also arise from pheromonal cues, although the role of pheromones in humans is disputed.\\r\\nPeptide hormones have important influences upon the hypothalamus, and to do so they must pass through the bloodÿbrain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective bloodÿbrain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.[citation needed]\\r\\nIt is not clear how all peptides that influence hypothalamic activity gain the necessary access. In the case of prolactin and leptin, there is evidence of active uptake at the choroid plexus from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Some pituitary hormones have a negative feedback influence upon hypothalamic secretion; for example, growth hormone feeds back on the hypothalamus, but how it enters the brain is not clear. There is also evidence for central actions of prolactin.[citation needed]\\r\\nFindings have suggested that thyroid hormone (T4) is taken up by the hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid hormone receptor in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.[20]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus functions as a type of thermostat for the body.[21] It sets a desired body temperature, and stimulates either heat production and retention to raise the blood temperature to a higher setting or sweating and vasodilation to cool the blood to a lower temperature. All fevers result from a raised setting in the hypothalamus; elevated body temperatures due to any other cause are classified as hyperthermia.[21] Rarely, direct damage to the hypothalamus, such as from a stroke, will cause a fever; this is sometimes called a hypothalamic fever. However, it is more common for such damage to cause abnormally low body temperatures.[21]\\r\\nThe hypothalamus contains neurons that react strongly to steroids and glucocorticoids ÿ (the steroid hormones of the adrenal gland, released in response to ACTH). It also contains specialized glucose-sensitive neurons (in the arcuate nucleus and ventromedial hypothalamus), which are important for appetite. The preoptic area contains thermosensitive neurons; these are important for TRH secretion.\\r\\nOxytocin secretion in response to suckling or vagino-cervical stimulation is mediated by some of these pathways; vasopressin secretion in response to cardiovascular stimuli arising from chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic arch, and from low-pressure atrial volume receptors, is mediated by others. In the rat, stimulation of the vagina also causes prolactin secretion, and this results in pseudo-pregnancy following an infertile mating. In the rabbit, coitus elicits reflex ovulation. In the sheep, cervical stimulation in the presence of high levels of estrogen can induce maternal behavior in a virgin ewe. These effects are all mediated by the hypothalamus, and the information is carried mainly by spinal pathways that relay in the brainstem. Stimulation of the nipples stimulates release of oxytocin and prolactin and suppresses the release of LH and FSH.\\r\\nCardiovascular stimuli are carried by the vagus nerve. The vagus also conveys a variety of visceral information, including for instance signals arising from gastric distension or emptying, to suppress or promote feeding, by signalling the release of leptin or gastrin, respectively. Again this information reaches the hypothalamus via relays in the brainstem.\\r\\nIn addition hypothalamic function is responsive toand regulated bylevels of all three classical monoamine neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), in those tracts from which it receives innervation. For example, noradrenergic inputs arising from the locus coeruleus have important regulatory effects upon corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels.\\r\\nThe extreme lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for the control of food intake. Stimulation of this area causes increased food intake. Bilateral lesion of this area causes complete cessation of food intake. Medial parts of the nucleus have a controlling effect on the lateral part. Bilateral lesion of the medial part of the ventromedial nucleus causes hyperphagia and obesity of the animal. Further lesion of the lateral part of the ventromedial nucleus in the same animal produces complete cessation of food intake.\\r\\nThere are different hypotheses related to this regulation:[23]\\r\\nThe medial zone of hypothalamus is part of a circuitry that controls motivated behaviors, like defensive behaviors.[24] Analyses of Fos-labeling showed that a series of nuclei in the \\"behavioral control column\\" is important in regulating the expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors.[25]\\r\\nExposure to a predator (such as a cat) elicits defensive behaviors in laboratory rodents, even when the animal has never been exposed to a cat.[26] In the hypothalamus, this exposure causes an increase in Fos-labeled cells in the anterior hypothalamic nucleus, the dorsomedial part of the ventromedial nucleus, and in the ventrolateral part of the premammillary nucleus (PMDvl).[27] The premammillary nucleus has an important role in expression of defensive behaviors towards a predator, since lesions in this nucleus abolish defensive behaviors, like freezing and flight.[27][28] The PMD does not modulate defensive behavior in other situations, as lesions of this nucleus had minimal effects on post-shock freezing scores.[28] The PMD has important connections to the dorsal periaqueductal gray, an important structure in fear expression.[29][30] In addition, animals display risk assessment behaviors to the environment previously associated with the cat. Fos-labeled cell analysis showed that the PMDvl is the most activated structure in the hypothalamus, and inactivation with muscimol prior to exposure to the context abolishes the defensive behavior.[27] Therefore, the hypothalamus, mainly the PMDvl, has an important role in expression of innate and conditioned defensive behaviors to a predator.\\r\\nLikewise, the hypothalamus has a role in social defeat: Nuclei in medial zone are also mobilized during an encounter with an aggressive conspecific. The defeated animal has an increase in Fos levels in sexually dimorphic structures, such as the medial pre-optic nucleus, the ventrolateral part of ventromedial nucleus, and the ventral premammilary nucleus.[31] Such structures are important in other social behaviors, such as sexual and aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the premammillary nucleus also is mobilized, the dorsomedial part but not the ventrolateral part.[31] Lesions in this nucleus abolish passive defensive behavior, like freezing and the \\"on-the-back\\" posture.[31]\\r\\nAccording to D. F. Swaab, writing in a July 2008 paper, \\"Neurobiological research related to sexual orientation in humans is only just gathering momentum, but the evidence already shows that humans have a vast array of brain differences, not only in relation to gender, but also in relation to sexual orientation.\\"[32]\\r\\nSwaab first reported on the relationship between sexual orientation in males and the hypothalamus's \\"clock\\", the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In 1990, Swaab and Hofman[33] reported that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in homosexual men was significantly larger than in heterosexual men. Then in 1995, Swaab et al.[34] linked brain development to sexual orientation by treating male rats both pre- and postnatally with ATD, an aromatase blocker in the brain. This produced an enlarged SCN and bisexual behavior in the adult male rats. In 1991, LeVay showed that part of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN) known as the 3rd interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 3), is nearly twice as large (in terms of volume) in heterosexual men than in homosexual men and heterosexual women. However, a study in 1992 has shown that the sexually dimorph nucleus of the preoptic area, which include the INAH3, are of similar size in homosexual males who died of AIDS to heterosexual males, and therefore larger than female. This clearly contradicts the hypothesis that homosexual males have a female hypothalamus. Furthermore, the SCN of homosexual males is extremely large (both the volume and the number of neurons are twice as many as in heterosexual males). These areas of the hypothalamus have not yet been explored in homosexual females nor bisexual males nor females. Although the functional implications of such findings still haven't been examined in detail, they cast serious doubt over the widely accepted D?rner hypothesis that homosexual males have a \\"female hypothalamus\\" and that the key mechanism of differentiating the \\"male brain from originally female brain\\" is the epigenetic influence of testosterone during prenatal development.[35][36]\\r\\nIn 2004 and 2006, two studies by Berglund, Lindstr?m, and Savic[37][38] used positron emission tomography (PET) to observe how the hypothalamus responds to smelling common odors, the scent of testosterone found in male sweat, and the scent of estrogen found in female urine. These studies showed that the hypothalamus of heterosexual men and homosexual women both respond to estrogen. Also, the hypothalamus of homosexual men and heterosexual women both respond to testosterone. The hypothalamus of all four groups did not respond to the common odors, which produced a normal olfactory response in the brain.\\r\\nHuman brain left dissected midsagittal view\\r\\nLocation of the hypothalamus\\r\\nBear, Mark F. \\"Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary.\\" Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain. 4th ed.

The S8 and S8+ were unveiled on 29 March 2017 and directly succeed the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, with a North American release on 21 April 2017 and international rollout throughout April and May. The S8 Active was announced on 8 August 2017 and is exclusive to certain U.S. cellular carriers.\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ contain upgraded hardware and major design changes over the S7 line, including larger screens with a taller aspect ratio and curved sides on both the smaller and larger models, iris and face recognition, a new suite of virtual assistant features known as Bixby (along with a new dedicated physical button for launching the assistant), a shift from MicroUSB to USB-C charging, and Samsung DeX, a docking station accessory that allows the phones to be used with a desktop interface with keyboard and mouse input support. The S8 Active features tougher materials designed for protection against shock, shatter, water and dust, with a metal frame and a tough texture for improved grip that makes the S8 Active have a rugged design. The Active's screen measures the same size as the standard S8 model but loses the curved edges in favor of a metal frame.\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ received mostly positive reviews. Their design and form factor received praise, while critics also liked the updated software and camera optimizations. They received criticism for duplicate software apps, lackluster Bixby features at launch, for the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the rear next to the camera. A video published after the phones' release proved that the devices' facial and iris scanners can be fooled by suitable photographs of the user.\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ were in high demand at release. During the pre-order period, a record one million units were booked in South Korea, and overall sales numbers were 30% higher than the Galaxy S7. However, subsequent reports in May announced sales of over five million units, a notably lower first-month sales number than previous Galaxy S series models.\\r\\nOn March 11, 2018, Samsung unveiled the successor to the S8 flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S9.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPrior to its official announcement, media outlets reported on rumors and information from industry insiders. In December 2016, SamMobile reported that the Galaxy S8 would not feature a 3.5?mm headphone jack,[10] later reported to be a false rumor.[11] In January 2017, The Guardian reported on bigger screens for both of the two phone sizes, with edge-to-edge \\"infinity\\" displays and very limited bezels, and an iris scanner.[12] Additionally, The Guardian stated that the phones would come with 64?gigabytes of storage and support microSD cards, use USB-C connectors, and feature a \\"Bixby\\" intelligent personal assistant.[12][13][14] Soon after, VentureBeat revealed photos of the phones and additional details, including the lack of physical navigation and home buttons, in which the fingerprint sensor was moved to the back of the phone.[15][16][17] Evan Blass tweeted in mid-March about color options for the phones.[18][19]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ were officially unveiled on 29 March 2017, with pre-orders beginning 30 March and official U.S. release on 21 April 2017.[20][21] Following Best Buy retail listings in March,[22] Samsung opened pre-orders for unlocked U.S. handsets on 9 May 2017, with availability starting 31 May.[23][24]\\r\\nThe devices have also been released internationally. On 21 April 2017, they were made available in South Korea,[25] Canada,[26] and Taiwan.[27] On 28 April, they were made available in the United Kingdom,[28] Australia,[29] Ireland,[30] and Russia.[31] followed by Singapore one day later.[32] On 5 May, they were made available in Malaysia.[33] New Zealand,[34] India,[35] the Philippines,[36] and Thailand.[37] followed by Brazil on 12 May.[38] On 25 May, they were made available in China,[39] and Hong Kong.[40] On 8 June, they were made available in Japan.[41]\\r\\nIn July 2017, pictures of the Galaxy S8 Active were leaked on Reddit,[42][43] and the following month, AT&T \\"accidentally\\" confirmed its existence through a document in a promotional campaign.[44][45] It officially became available for pre-order, exclusively through AT&T, on 8 August 2017, with in-store purchase available 11 August.[46] VentureBeat reported in late September that the device would also become available through T-Mobile in November,[47] and Samsung subsequently confirmed both T-Mobile and Sprint availability in early November.[48]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 and S8+ both feature 1440p OLED displays, with an 18.5:9 (37:18) aspect ratio taller than the 16:9 ratio used by the majority of smartphones; the S8 has a 5.8-inch panel, while the S8+ uses a larger 6.2-inch panel. The displays on both devices curve along the side bezels of the device, with minimal bezels that Samsung markets as an \\"Infinity Display\\", and the display panel itself has rounded edges.[20] They use DCI-P3, offering what screen-testing website DisplayMate describes as the largest native color gamut, highest peak brightness, highest contrast rating in ambient light, highest screen resolution, lowest reflectance, and highest contrast ratio.[49][50] The S8 features an octa-core Exynos 8895 system-on-chip and 4?GB of RAM; models in North American and East Asian markets utilize the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 instead. Both chips are manufactured by Samsung with a 10 nm process.[20][51] They contain 64?GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD card.[20] The Galaxy S8 is one of the first smartphones to support Bluetooth 5, supporting new capabilities such as connecting two wireless headphones to the device at once.[52] It is also bundled with Harman AKG earbuds.[53][54] Both smartphones have improved satellite navigation over the predecessors by including Galileo receivers.[5] In the United States, the S8 and S8+ are available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, and Arctic Silver color options, whereas gold and blue are available internationally.[20] The blue option was made available in the U.S. in July 2017.[55][56]\\r\\nUnlike past Galaxy S series models, the S8 line does not feature physical navigation keys, electing to use on-screen keys instead.[20] However, unlike other implementations, the home button can still be activated if it is hidden or the screen is off. The S8's display features pressure sensitivity limited to the home button.[57] To prevent the home button from burn-in damage, its position moves slightly.[58][59] While The Verge claims that the S8 uses exactly the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S7, though with software improvements,[20] a report from PhoneArena claims that the phones carry new, custom camera modules.[60] The front-facing camera was upgraded to an 8-megapixel sensor with autofocus.[20][61] The S8 features fingerprint and iris scanners; the fingerprint reader is relocated to the rear of the device, to the left of the camera, due to the removal of the physical home button.[20] In addition to an iris scanner, the S8 also features face-scanning as an option to unlock the phone.[62][63] Face recognition technology had previously been implemented in earlier models since the Galaxy S III.[64]\\r\\nThe S8 and S8+ use non-removable 3000 and 3500?mAh batteries respectively; Samsung stated that it had engineered the batteries to retain their capacity for a longer period of time than previous models.[61] The S8 supports AirFuel Inductive (formerly PMA)[65] and Qi wireless charging standards.[20] Due to the recalls of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, Samsung said in a press conference it is committed to stricter quality control and safety testing procedures on all of the company's future products.[66]\\r\\nSamsung also launched a Galaxy S8+ with 128?GB of storage and 6?GB of RAM exclusively in China and South Korea, and a bundle offer in the countries provides both the exclusive model and the Samsung DeX docking station.[67][68] The unique variant was also released in India in June 2017.[69]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 Active features a rugged design and significantly tougher materials to make it shock, shatter, water, and dust resistant. It has a larger battery than either of the regular S8s, at 4000?mAh. Unlike the previous phones in the Active line, the S8 Active does not have tactile buttons, instead using onscreen keys like the regular variants of the S8. It also no longer has the dedicated action button of previous versions which could be reprogrammed to be a shortcut to favorite apps, with the action button being replaced with the Bixby button. The \\"infinity\\" edge display of the standard models is removed, replaced with a metal frame and bumpers in the corners to protect from shocks, while the back is fitted with a \\"rugged, tough texture for a secure grip\\". Its screen also measures 5.8 inches, the size of the regular S8, and has quad HD Super AMOLED in 18.5:9 aspect ratio. The S8 Active is sold in Meteor Gray, but AT&T also has a Titanium Gold color.[46] The T-Mobile US version of the S8 Active also supports the company's 600 MHz LTE network that was starting to be rolled out at the time the device was announced.[70]\\r\\nThe Galaxy S8 launched with the Android 7.0 \\"Nougat\\" operating system with the proprietary Samsung Experience (formerly TouchWiz) user interface and software suite.[61] The software features a suite of assistant functions known as \\"Bixby\\", which is designed primarily to interact with Samsung's bundled applications and other supported services. The feature allows the use of voice commands to perform phone functions, can generate cards shown on a home screen page (replacing the Flipboard integration formerly featured) based on a user's interactions, and perform searches utilizing object recognition via the camera.[20]\\r\\nBixby supports third-party integration via an SDK.[61] The S8 supports the use of a docking station known as Samsung DeX to access a PC-like desktop environment on an external display, with support for mouse and keyboard input.[71] On 21 April 2017, coinciding with the phone's official retail date, reports surfaced that the default music player on the Galaxy S8 would be Google Play Music, continuing a trend that started with the S7 in 2016. However, for the S8, Samsung partnered with Google to incorporate additional exclusive features into the app, including the ability to upload up to 100,000 tracks to the service's cloud storage, an increase from the 50,000 tracks users are normally allowed to upload. Additionally, new users get a three-month free trial to the service, the same as given to users who purchase Google's own Pixel smartphone. Furthermore, Google stated that more Samsung-exclusive features will be added to the app in the future, and that the Bixby assistant will also be supported by the app.[72][73] Bixby replaces S Voice, the voice recognition technology previously found in Samsung Galaxy models.[74]\\r\\nIn May 2017, Google announced that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will support the company's Daydream virtual reality platform after Samsung rolls out a software update scheduled for mid-2017.[75][76] In July 2017, Verizon began rolling out an update for its devices, with support for Daydream.[77][78] The Galaxy S8 was one of the first Android phones to support ARCore, Google's augmented reality engine.[79][80]\\r\\nIn February 2018, the official Android 8.0 Oreo update began rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S8, Samsung Galaxy S8+, and Samsung Galaxy S8 Active.[81]\\r\\nBesides the phone's protective case reportedly cracking and peeling away in under 2 months of use, Dan Seifert of The Verge praised the design of the Galaxy S8, describing it as a \\"stunning device to look at and hold\\" that was \\"refined and polished to a literal shine\\", and adding that it \\"truly doesn't look like any other phone you might have used before\\". The hardware of the device was described as \\"practically flawless\\". Seifert also liked the new software, writing that \\"Samsung is known less for polish and more for clumsiness. In a refreshing change of pace, the software on the S8 is, dare I say, good [sic]\\". However, he criticized the Bixby assistant, writing that \\"in its current state, it doesnt do much at all\\", and also criticized the number of duplicate apps. Regarding performance, he wrote that the S8 was \\"fast and responsive, but so is virtually every other premium phone you can buy, and the S8 isnt noticeably faster or quicker than a Google Pixel, LG G6, or iPhone 7\\".[82] Fellow Verge reporter Vlad Savov felt that the placement of the fingerprint sensor was \\"a perplexing decision if we consider it as a deliberate design choice\\", but noted reports from Korea claiming that Samsung had originally intended for the fingerprint reader to be built directly into the screen, but was unable to reach a desirable implementation in time for release.[83] The Verge wrote that \\"Samsungs six-month-old S8 has cutting edge features and design with fewer issues than other Android phones\\" like the Google Pixel 2 and LG V30, and that the \\"OLED screen stretches to the edges of the device and curves on its sides in an almost liquid fashion. It makes the S8 look just as fresh today as it did when it debuted\\", and pointing out that the S8's popularity and carrier support guaranteed plenty of third-party accessories.[84]\\r\\nChris Velazco of Engadget similarly praised the design, stating that \\"from their rounded edges to their precisely formed metal-and-glass bodies, they feel like smaller, sleeker versions of the Galaxy Note 7\\", and also praised the display as being simply \\"awesome\\". Velazco also praised the software, calling Samsung's added interface \\"subtle and thoughtful in its design choices\\". While noting that the Bixby assistant wasn't ready yet, he did compliment the promised voice features as being more granular than those offered through Siri or Google Assistant, and wrote that \\"With that kind of complexity involved, maybe it's no surprise this stuff isn't done yet\\". Also praising performance and the camera, though noting that \\"The 12-megapixel sensors on the back haven't changed much since last year. That's not a bad thing since they were great cameras to start with\\", Velazco summarized his review by writing that the devices \\"aren't perfect, but they're as close as Samsung has ever gotten\\".[85] Brandon Russell of TechnoBuffalo claimed that the camera could not beat Google's Pixel smartphone.[86]\\r\\nRon Amadeo of Ars Technica noted that the device's unusual aspect ratio resulted in pillarboxing when watching 16:9 video without zooming or stretching it. He complimented the feel of the S8, calling it \\"perfected\\", but criticized the glass back for being \\"more fragile\\" and that \\"Glossy, slippery glass doesn't feel as good in your hand as metal does, either. For the top-tier premium price tag, we'd prefer Samsung to put in the extra work and use a metal back\\". He criticized the biometric options for unlocking the phones, writing that \\"There's an iris scanner, a fingerprint reader, and face unlock. The problem is none of them are any good\\", and also criticized duplicate apps, writing that \\"most of which can't be removed and aren't very compelling\\". Additionally, he criticized Bixby, calling it \\"an odd addition\\" due to the phone's Google Assistant functionality already present.[87]\\r\\nPrior to the phone's official announcement, reports suggested that Bixby would support \\"7-8 languages\\" at launch.[88] Later reports after the phone's announcement clarified that Bixby would only support Korean and American English languages at its release, though noting that more languages would be coming \\"in the following months\\".[89][90] In mid-April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Bixby would be launched without support for American English.[91][92] On 19 July 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby had begun rolling out to Galaxy S8 users in the United States.[93][94]\\r\\nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ broke pre-order records in South Korea, with more than 720,000 units booked in one week, a notable increase from the 100,000 units of the Galaxy S7 and 200,000 units of the Note 7.[95][96] By mid-April, the number had increased to one million pre-orders.[97][98] On 24 April 2017, Samsung announced that sales of the Galaxy S8 was its \\"best ever\\". Although it did not release specific sales numbers, it announced that sales of the S8 were 30% higher year-over-year than the Galaxy S7.[99][100] Subsequent reports in May announced that Samsung had sold over five million units.[101][102] Jon Fingas of Engadget wrote that, although Samsung advertised its pre-order records, sales comparisons to other models on the market were difficult due to unannounced sales figures.[103] However, a report from AppleInsider took a comparison look at previous Galaxy S models' first-month sales, writing that the Galaxy S7 saw 7-9 million units shipped in its first month, and the Galaxy S4 sold 10 million. The publication further wrote that \\"Each year since reaching Peak Galaxy in 2014, Samsung has floated the idea that its new model has outpaced sales, shipments (or sometimes \\"preorders\\") of the previous edition, but in reality Galaxy S salesand subsequently Samsung Mobile profitshave actually never recovered since the Galaxy S4\\".[104]\\r\\nPrior to the official release, it was reported that some Galaxy S8 displays had a bad white balance, causing them to exhibit a reddish tint.[105] Samsung stated that the Galaxy S8 was \\"built with an adaptive display that optimizes the colour range, saturation, and sharpness depending on the environment\\", but noted that the device's operating system provides settings for manually adjusting the display's appearance and white balance.[105][106][107] On 21 April, Samsung stated that the red tinting was purely a software issue, and would be patched in a future update.[108] The Investor reported that Samsung would replace the affected devices if a software update did not fix the issue.[109] Updates in various regions started rolling out in early May, fixing the issue.[110][111][112]\\r\\nReports surfaced at the end of April that some Galaxy S8 devices were \\"restarting by themselves\\". Samsung has not yet commented on the issue.[113][114]\\r\\nShortly after the phone's unveiling, bloggers produced a video showing that the Galaxy S8's facial recognition scanner could be tricked to unlock the phone by showing it a photo of the user.[115][116] In a statement to Business Insider, a Samsung spokesperson stated that \\"Facial recognition is a convenient action to open your phone ÿ similar to the 'swipe to unlock' action. We offer the highest level of biometric authentication ÿ fingerprint and iris ÿ to lock your phone and authenticate access to Samsung Pay or Secure Folder\\".[117]\\r\\nIn May 2017, researchers from the Chaos Computer Club posted a video showing that the S8's iris recognition system can be fooled with a contact lens and a suitable photograph of an eye.[118] Samsung told BBC News that it was \\"aware of the issue\\", and stated that \\"If there is a potential vulnerability or the advent of a new method that challenges our efforts to ensure security at any time, we will respond as quickly as possible to resolve the issue\\".[119]\\r\\nIn October 2017, Galaxy S8 users reported on Reddit that they were unable to receive SMS messages, with no fix available and without any comment from Samsung.[120]","input":"When was the samsung galaxy s8 plus released?"},{"output":"regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones, neuropeptides and immune cells","context":"The hair follicle is a dynamic organ found in mammalian skin.[1] It resides in the dermal layer of the skin and is made up of 20 different cell types, each with distinct functions. The hair follicle regulates hair growth via a complex interaction between hormones, neuropeptides and immune cells.[1] This complex interaction induces the hair follicle to produce different types of hair as seen on different parts of the body. For example, terminal hairs grow on the scalp and lanugo hairs are seen covering the bodies of fetuses in utero and in some new born babies.[1] The process of hair growth occurs in distinct sequential stages. The first stage is called anagen and is the active growth phase, catagen is the resting stage, telogen is the regression of the hair follicle phase, exogen is the active shedding of hair phase and lastly kenogen is the phase between the empty hair follicle and the growth of new hair.[1]\\r\\nThe function of hair in humans has long been a subject of interest and continues to be an important topic in society, developmental biology and medicine. Of all mammals, humans have the longest growth phase of scalp hair compared to hair growth on other parts of the body.[1] For centuries, humans have ascribed esthetics to scalp hair styling and dressing and it is often used to communicate social or cultural norms in societies. In addition to its role in defining human appearance, scalp hair also provides protection from UV sun rays and is an insulator against extremes of hot and cold temperatures.[1] Differences in the shape of the scalp hair follicle determine the observed ethnic differences in scalp hair appearance, length and texture.\\r\\nThere are many human diseases in which abnormalities in hair appearance, texture or growth are early signs of local disease of the hair follicle or systemic illness. Well known diseases of the hair follicle include alopecia or hair loss, hirsutism or excess hair growth and lupus erythematosus.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe position and distribution of hair follicles changes over the body. For example, the skin of the palms and soles do not have hair follicles whereas skin of the scalp, forearms, legs and genitalia have abundant hair follicles.[1] There are many structures that make up the hair follicle. Anatomically, the triad of hair follicle, sebaceous gland and arrector pili muscle make up the pilosebaceous unit.[1]\\r\\nA hair follicle consists of?:\\r\\nOther structures associated with the hair follicle include the cup in which the follicle grows known as the infundibulum,[7] the arrector pili muscles, the sebaceous glands, and the apocrine sweat glands. Hair follicle receptors sense the position of the hair.\\r\\nAttached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber called the arrector pili. This muscle is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more perpendicular to the surface of the skin, and causing the follicle to protrude slightly above the surrounding skin (piloerection) and a pore encased with skin oil. This process results in goose bumps (or goose flesh).\\r\\nAlso attached to the follicle is a sebaceous gland, which produces the oily or waxy substance sebum. The higher the density of the hair, the more sebaceous glands that are found.\\r\\nThere are ethnic differences in several different hair characteristics. The differences in appearance and texture of hair are due to many factors: the position of the hair bulb relative to the hair follicle, size and shape of the dermal papilla, and the curvature of the hair follicle.[1] The scalp hair follicles in Caucasians is elliptical in shape and therefore produces straight or wavy hair. Whereas, the scalp hair follicle of African people descent is more curvy resulting in the growth of tightly curled hair.[1]\\r\\n(micrometers)\\r\\nIn utero, the epithelium and underlying mesenchyme interact to form hair follicles.[8]\\r\\nA key aspect of hair loss with age is the aging of the hair follicle. Ordinarily, hair follicle renewal is maintained by the stem cells associated with each follicle. Aging of the hair follicle appears to be primed by a sustained cellular response to the DNA damage that accumulates in renewing stem cells during aging.[9] This damage response involves the proteolysis of type XVII collagen by neutrophil elastase in response to the DNA damage in the hair follicle stem cells. Proteolysis of collagen leads to elimination of the damaged cells and then to terminal hair follicle miniaturization.\\r\\nHair grows in cycles of various phases:[10] anagen is the growth phase; catagen is the involuting or regressing phase; and telogen, the resting or quiescent phase (names derived using the Greek prefixes ana-, kata-, and telos- meaning up, down, and end respectively). Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub-phases. Prior to the start of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis (formation of the follicle). There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one or several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase, while 10ÿ14% are in telogen and 1ÿ2% in catagen. The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3ÿ4 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hair have a much shorter length limit compared to hair on the head. Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor. DLX3 is a crucial regulator of hair follicle differentiation and cycling. Specifically, colocalization of phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 complex and DLX3 regulate role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis in animal models.[11][12]\\r\\nAnagen is the active growth phase of hair follicles[13] during which the root of the hair is dividing rapidly, adding to the hair shaft. During this phase the hair grows about 1?cm every 28 days. Scalp hair stays in this active phase of growth for 2ÿ7 years; this period is genetically determined. At the end of the anagen phase an unknown signal causes the follicle to go into the catagen phase.\\r\\nThe catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase.[14] It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2ÿ3 weeks while the hair converts to a club hair. A club hair is formed during the catagen phase when the part of the hair follicle in contact with the lower portion of the hair becomes attached to the hair shaft. This process cuts the hair off from its blood supply and from the cells that produce new hair. When a club hair is completely formed, about a 2-week process, the hair follicle enters the telogen phase.\\r\\nThe telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle.[15] When the body is subjected to extreme stress, as much as 70 percent of hair can prematurely enter the telogen phase and begin to fall, causing a noticeable loss of hair. This condition is called telogen effluvium.[16] The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair.[8] Fifty to one-hundred club hair are shed daily from a normal scalp.[8]\\r\\nThere are many human diseases in which abnormalities in hair appearance, texture or growth are early signs of local disease of the hair follicle or systemic illness. Well known diseases of the hair follicle include alopecia or hair loss, hirsutism or excess hair growth and lupus erythematosus.[2] Therefore understanding the function of the normal hair follicle is fundamental to diagnosing and treating many dermatologic and systemic diseases with hair abnormalities.[2]\\r\\nmale alopecia\\r\\nAlopecia scale\\r\\nlupus erythematosus\\r\\nHidradenitis suppurativa\\r\\nHair follicles form the basis of the two primary methods of hair transplantation in hair restoration, Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and follicular unit extraction (FUE). In each of these methods, naturally occurring groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units, are extracted from the hair restoration patient and then surgically implanted in the balding area of the patient's scalp, known as the recipient area. These follicles are extracted from donor areas of the scalp, or other parts of the body, which are typically resistant to the miniaturization effects of the hormone DHT. It is this miniaturization of the hair shaft that is the primary predictive indicator of androgenetic alopecia,[17] commonly referred to as male pattern baldness or male hair loss. When these DHT-resistant follicles are transplanted to the recipient area, they continue to grow hair in the normal hair cycle, thus providing the hair restoration patient with permanent, naturally-growing hair. More than 60% of men and 10% of women suffer from hair loss.[citation needed]\\r\\nWhile hair transplantation dates back to the 1950s,[18] and plucked human hair follicle cell culture in vitro to the early 1980s,[19] it was not until 1995 when hair transplantation using individual follicular units was introduced into medical literature.[20]\\r\\n Media related to Hair follicle at Wikimedia Commons","input":"What is the function of a hair follicle?"},{"output":"pork barbecue and bacon","context":"The Culture of North Carolina is a subculture in the United States. As a coastal state, North Carolina culture has been greatly influenced by the southeastern United States and early settlers from England. More recently, North Carolina has a seen an influx of immigrants from New England as well as Hispanic immigrants. Many of these recent transplants aggregate in one of several urban centers on cat Carolina, such as the Research Triangle Park area. Rural North Carolina has a rich culture with roots in colonial and Confederate times. Agriculture is a major component of the economy in rural North Carolina, and thus many local traditions are centered on the lifestyles associated with farming. Some of these traditions are reflected in pop culture in North Carolina, for instance North Carolinians may refer to the state as \\"the Tar Heel state\\". This is a point of pride for some local North Carolinians.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the presence of several dense urban centers in North Carolina, several cities have very distinctive cultures and most have a melting pot of cultures. The Research Triangle Park, also known as RTP, area is chiefly composed of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill as well as several other smaller cities including Carrboro, Morrisvile, Cary and Apex. RTP serves as an anchor for many large businesses in the area, which has the effect of attracting many secondary and supporting businesses. This has created a high concentration of educated and affluent homes in and around RTP. This has created demand for independent, unique, and high quality restaurants and night life in the area as well as a high demand for craft beer.\\r\\nDespite having several urban centers, these cities are smaller than many more well-known metropolitan areas across the United States. So while these urban centers have many similar amenities to larger cities, the options and variability can be limited. Due to this, there is a very high unmet demand for modern urban amenities and entertainment. This unmet demand has led to nearly constant construction and development in areas such as RTP and Charlotte for several decades. These construction projects include planned subdivisions, restaurants, strip malls, highway expansions, new schools, and business parks.\\r\\nWhile there are several dense urban centers across North Carolina, much of North Carolina remains rural. Dense forests cover much of North Carolina as well as reclaimed land used for agricultural purposes. Rural North Carolina tends to lean towards traditional Southern culture. Some common recreational activities in rural North Carolina include horseback riding, swimming in rivers and lakes, target shooting and hunting, riding trails on ATVs and modified trucks (also called off-roading), extensive gardening (many families operate small scale farms). Many rural North Carolinians jokingly refer to themselves as rednecks.\\r\\nA nationally-famous cuisine from North Carolina is pork barbecue and bacon. In Eastern North Carolina pork barbecue uses a vinegar-based sauce and the \\"whole hog\\" is cooked, thus using both white and dark meat. While there is not one town in Eastern NC that can claim to be the indisputable \\"capital\\" of Eastern North Carolina barbecue, the medium-sized cities of Greenville and Goldsboro and their surrounding communities boast the highest concentrations of highly ranked establishments.[citation needed] The annual Newport Pig Pickin' (the largest whole pig cooking contest in North Carolina)[citation needed] is held featuring primarily eastern-style barbecue. Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato and vinegar based sauce and only the pork shoulder (dark meat) is used. The \\"capital\\" of western Carolina barbecue is indisputably the Piedmont Triad town of Lexington, home of the Lexington Barbecue Festival which brings in over 100,000 visitors each October.\\r\\nThe University of North Carolina system encompasses 16 public universities including North Carolina A&T State University, North Carolina State University, North Carolina Central University, UNC-Pembroke, UNC-Chapel Hill, Elizabeth City State University, East Carolina University, Western Carolina University, Winston-Salem State University, UNC Charlotte, UNC Greensboro, Fayetteville State University and Appalachian State University. Along with its public universities, North Carolina has 58 public community colleges in its community college system. There are also a number of private colleges, for example Duke University in Durham, Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, Campbell University in Buies Creek, North Carolina and Elon University, in Elon, North Carolina.\\r\\nNorth Carolina is known particularly for its tradition of old-time music, and many recordings were made in the early 20th century by folk song collector Bascom Lamar Lunsford. Most influentially, North Carolina country musicians like the North Carolina Ramblers and Al Hopkins helped solidify the sound of country music in the late 1920s, while influential bluegrass musicians such as Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson and Del McCoury came from North Carolina. Arthur Smith is the most notable North Carolina musician/entertainer who had the first nationally syndicated television program which featured country music. Smith composed \\"Guitar Boogie\\", the all-time best selling guitar instrumental, and \\"Dueling Banjos\\", the all-time best selling banjo composition. Country rock star Eric Church from the Hickory area has had 2 #1 albums on the Billboard 200, including Chief in 2011. Both North and South Carolina are a hotbed for traditional country blues, especially the style known as the Piedmont blues. Elizabeth Cotten, from Chapel Hill, was active in the American folk music revival.\\r\\nBecause of their proximity to universities the areas of Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area (collectively known as the Triangle), Asheville, Greensboro, Greenville, Charlotte, and Wilmington have long been a well-known center for indie rock, metal, punk, jazz, country and hip-hop. Bands from this popular music scene include The Avett Brothers, Corrosion of Conformity, Superchunk, The Rosebuds, The Love Language, Tift Merritt, Ben Folds Five, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Lords of the Underground, Between the Buried and Me and Charlie Daniels.\\r\\nNorth Carolina is home to professional-level sports teams, including basketball, football, and hockey:\\r\\nNASCAR racing is also a popular sport in North Carolina.

The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex.[1] The primary visual cortex is Brodmann area 17, commonly called V1 (visual one). Human V1 is located on the medial side of the occipital lobe within the calcarine sulcus; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe. V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin, the Stria of Gennari. Visually driven regions outside V1 are called extrastriate cortex. There are many extrastriate regions, and these are specialized for different visual tasks, such as visuospatial processing, color differentiation, and motion perception. The name derives from the overlying occipital bone, which is named from the Latin ob, behind, and caput, the head. Bilateral lesions of the occipital lobe can lead to cortical blindness (See Anton's syndrome).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two occipital lobes are the smallest of four paired lobes in the human cerebral cortex. Located in the rearmost portion of the skull, the occipital lobes are part of the forebrain. None of the cortical lobes are defined by any internal structural features, but rather by the bones of the head bone that overlie them. Thus, the occipital lobe is defined as the part of the cerebral cortex that lies underneath the occipital bone. (See the human brain article for more information.)\\r\\nThe lobes rest on the tentorium cerebelli, a process of dura mater that separates the cerebrum from the cerebellum. They are structurally isolated in their respective cerebral hemispheres by the separation of the cerebral fissure. At the front edge of the occipital are several lateral occipital gyri, which are separated by lateral occipital sulcus.\\r\\nThe occipital aspects along the inside face of each hemisphere are divided by the calcarine sulcus. Above the medial, Y-shaped sulcus lies the cuneus, and the area below the sulcus is the lingual gyrus.\\r\\nDamage to the primary visual areas of the occipital lobe can leave a person with partial or complete blindness.[2]\\r\\nThe occipital lobe is divided into several functional visual areas. Each visual area contains a full map of the visual world. Although there are no anatomical markers distinguishing these areas (except for the prominent striations in the striate cortex), physiologists have used electrode recordings to divide the cortex into different functional regions.\\r\\nThe first functional area is the primary visual cortex. It contains a low-level description of the local orientation, spatial-frequency and color properties within small receptive fields. Primary visual cortex projects to the occipital areas of the ventral stream (visual area V2 and visual area V4), and the occipital areas of the dorsal streamvisual area V3, visual area MT (V5), and the dorsomedial area (DM).\\r\\nThe ventral stream is known for the processing the \\"what\\" in vision, while the dorsal stream handles the \\"where/how.\\" This is because the ventral stream provides important information for the identification of stimuli that are stored in memory. With this information in memory, the dorsal stream is able to focus on motor actions in response to the outside stimuli.\\r\\nAlthough numerous studies have shown that the two systems are independent and structured separately from another, there is also evidence that both are essential for successful perception, especially as the stimuli takes on more complex forms. For example, a case study using fMRI was done on shape and location. The first procedure consisted of location tasks. The second procedure was in a lit-room where participants were shown stimuli on a screen for 600?ms. They found that the two pathways play a role in shape perception even though location processing continues to lie within the dorsal stream.[3]\\r\\nThe dorsomedial (DM) is not as thoroughly studied. However, there is some evidence that suggests that this stream interacts with other visual areas. A case study on monkeys revealed that information from V1 and V2 areas make up half the inputs in the DM. The remaining inputs are from multiple sources that have to do with any sort of visual processing [4]\\r\\nA significant functional aspect of the occipital lobe is that it contains the primary visual cortex.\\r\\nRetinal sensors convey stimuli through the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate bodies, where optic radiations continue to the visual cortex. Each visual cortex receives raw sensory information from the outside half of the retina on the same side of the head and from the inside half of the retina on the other side of the head. The cuneus (Brodmann's area 17) receives visual information from the contralateral superior retina representing the inferior visual field. The lingula receives information from the contralateral inferior retina representing the superior visual field. The retinal inputs pass through a \\"way station\\" in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus before projecting to the cortex. Cells on the posterior aspect of the occipital lobes' gray matter are arranged as a spatial map of the retinal field. Functional neuroimaging reveals similar patterns of response in cortical tissue of the lobes when the retinal fields are exposed to a strong pattern.\\r\\nIf one occipital lobe is damaged, the result can be homonymous hemianopsia vision loss from similarly positioned \\"field cuts\\" in each eye. Occipital lesions can cause visual hallucinations. Lesions in the parietal-temporal-occipital association area are associated with color agnosia, movement agnosia, and agraphia. Damage to the primary visual cortex, which is located on the surface of the posterior occipital lobe, can cause blindness due to the holes in the visual map on the surface of the visual cortex that resulted from the lesions.[5]\\r\\nRecent studies have shown that specific neurological findings have affected idiopathic occipital lobe epilepsies.[6] Occipital lobe seizures are triggered by a flash, or a visual image that contains multiple colors. These are called flicker stimulation (usually through TV) these seizures are referred to as photo-sensitivity seizures. Patients having experienced occipital seizures described their seizures as featuring bright colors, and severely blurring their vision (vomiting was also apparent in some patients). Occipital seizures are triggered mainly during the day, through television, video games or any flicker stimulatory system.[7] Occipital seizures originate from an epileptic focus confined within the occipital lobes. They may be spontaneous or triggered by external visual stimuli. Occipital lobe epilepsies are etiologically idiopathic, symptomatic, or cryptogenic.[8] Symptomatic occipital seizures can start at any age, as well as any stage after or during the course of the underlying causative disorder. Idiopathic occipital epilepsy usually starts in childhood.[8] Occipital epilepsies account for approximately 5% to 10% of all epilepsies.[8]\\r\\nBase of brain.\\r\\nDrawing to illustrate the relations of the brain to the skull.\\r\\nOccipital lobe in blue\\r\\nOccipital lobe\\r\\nOccipital lobe\\r\\nVentricles of brain and basal ganglia.Superior view.

The NFL was the first professional football league to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts. Only two teams currently in the NFL, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are founding members.[1] The Green Bay Packers, founded 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921), is the oldest NFL franchise in continuous operation with the same name in the same location.[2]\\r\\nLeague membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization. The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946 following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post, mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball. Teams became more financially viable, the last team folding in 1952 and the league absorbing teams from the briefly more successful All-America Football Conference in 1950, two of which survive to the present day. By 1958, when that season's NFL championship game became known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\", the NFL was on its way to becoming one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.\\r\\nThe rival American Football League was founded in 1960. It was very successful, and forced a merger with the older NFL that resulted in a greatly expanded league and the creation of the Super Bowl, which has become the most-watched annual sporting event in the United States. The league continued to expand to its current size of 32 teams. A series of labor agreements during the 1990s and increasingly large television contracts has helped keep the league one of the most profitable in the U.S., and the only major league in the U.S. since 1990 to avoid a work stoppage that resulted in the loss of regular-season games.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFootball was first professionalized in 1892, when William Heffelfinger and Ben \\"Sport\\" Donnelly each received a large sum of cash to play for the Allegheny Athletic Association of the Western Pennsylvania Senior Independent Football Conference. Through the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century, professional football was primarily a regional sport, with most informal circuits centered around a single state or region with only limited play outside state lines. There were no national leagues or tournaments for the professional game, despite numerous attempts: an earlier National Football League (backed by what would become Major League Baseball) was unable to expand beyond Pennsylvania in 1902, the New York City-based World Series of Pro Football tournament disbanded after two seasons and lack of fan interest, and other attempts to either combine existing circuits or create new ones from scratch never materialized.\\r\\nBy the late 1910s, the regional circuits had coalesced into more or less leagues of varying degrees of organization. One of the most prominent at the time was the Ohio League, which boasted the services of legendary Native American athlete Jim Thorpe, among other stars. Another was the somewhat lower-caliber, but better-organized, New York Pro Championship; two of the New York circuit's best teams, the Rochester Jeffersons and the Buffalo All-Stars, went on a barnstorming tour of Ohio in 1917. After the Jeffersons played, and lost badly to, Thorpe's Canton Bulldogs in a 1917 match, Jeffersons owner Leo Lyons (believing that the foundation of a league could build a sport that rivaled baseball, which then held an effective monopoly on professional sport, in popularity) suggested to Thorpe that a league be formed.[3]\\r\\nLyons' vision of a national league of existing football clubs (which, at the time, was competing with another proposed league, again backed by baseball) was cut short by the United States' entry into World War I and further hampered by a flu pandemic in 1918, which forced most of the Ohio League teams to suspend operations due to either travel restrictions or loss of players to the war effort. New York's teams, although they were forced to reduce their schedules, continued and (along with the few other remaining teams that survived the suspension, including the OL's Dayton Triangles and Michigan's Detroit Heralds) picked up many of the stars that remained stateside. This had the effect of spreading out the talent across a broader geographic area. Over the course of 1919, as professional football had increased in parity, teams began reaching out and participating in more barnstorming tours. By then, two informal but distinct interstate circuits had developed: one around the Eastern Seaboard (particularly New York City, New Jersey and Philadelphia) that played mostly on Saturdays due to blue laws, and another centered around the Midwestern region (Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, and upstate New York) that played on Sundays. It was the latter that formed the basis of what would eventually become the modern National Football League.\\r\\nOhio's teams went along with the idea in the face of escalating costs: several bidding wars in the early 1900s, both in Pennsylvania and Ohio, had damaged the sport significantly, and another bidding war was about to erupt if something was not done. By forming a national league, teams reasoned that it would eliminate the practices of looting other teams' rosters and concentrating top talent in only a few teams, thus distributing talent more evenly and efficiently thereby reducing costs for each individual team while still keeping a top-level product on the field.\\r\\nOn August 20, 1920, at a Hupmobile dealership in Canton, Ohio, the league was formalized, originally as the American Professional Football Conference, initially consisting only of the Ohio League teams, although some of the teams declined participation.[4] One month later on September 17, the league was renamed the American Professional Football Association, adding Buffalo and Rochester from the New York league, and Detroit, Hammond (a suburban Chicago squad), and several other teams from nearby circuits. The eleven founding teams initially struck an agreement over player poaching and the declaration of an end-of-season champion. Thorpe, while still playing for the Bulldogs, was elected president. Only four of the founding teams finished the 1920 schedule and the undefeated Akron Pros claimed the first championship. Membership of the league increased to 22 teams ÿ including more of the New York teams ÿ in 1921, but throughout the 1920s the membership was unstable and the league was not a major national sport. On June 24, 1922, the organization, now headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, changed its title a final time to the National Football League.[5]\\r\\nTwo charter members, the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) and the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears), are still in existence. The Green Bay Packers franchise, founded in 1919, is the oldest team not to change locations, but did not begin league play until 1921. The New York Football Giants joined in 1925, followed by the Portsmouth Spartans in 1930, relocating to Detroit in 1934 to become the Lions.[6] The Indianapolis Colts franchise traces its history through several predecessors, including one of the league's founding teams ÿ the Dayton Triangles ÿ but is considered a separate franchise from those teams and was founded as the Baltimore Colts in 1953. Although the original NFL teams representing Buffalo, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit no longer exist, replacement franchises have since been established for those cities.\\r\\nEarly championships were awarded to the team with the best won-lost record, initially rather haphazardly, as some teams played more or fewer games than others, or scheduled games against non-league, amateur or collegiate teams; this led to the title being decided on a tiebreaker in 1921, a disputed title in 1925, and the scheduling of an impromptu indoor playoff game in 1932. The lack of a firm league structure meant that numerous teams regularly were added and removed from the league each year; a franchise owner might trade in his franchise in one city for one in another (as was the case with the Canton Bulldogs, Cleveland Bulldogs and Detroit Wolverines), and if a larger-market or more established team wanted a player on a smaller-market upstart, it could buy out the team outright and fold it to gain rights to that player, as the New York Giants did to the Wolverines in 1928 to get Benny Friedman.\\r\\nIn league meetings prior to the 1933 season, three new teams, the Pirates, the Cincinnati Reds and the Eagles, were admitted to the NFL.[7][8] Ten teams were then in the NFL and, at George Preston Marshall's urging, with Halas' support, NFL was reorganized into an Eastern Division and a Western Division. In the Eastern Division were the Philadelphia Eagles, Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, Boston Redskins, and the Pittsburgh Pirates. In the Western Division were the Chicago Bears, Portsmouth Spartans, Chicago Cardinals, Green Bay Packers, and the Cincinnati Reds. Furthermore, the two owners convinced the league to have the two division winners meet in a NFL Championship Game.[9]\\r\\nBy 1934, all of the small-town teams, with the exception of the Green Bay Packers, had moved to or been replaced by teams in big cities, and even Green Bay had begun to play a portion of its home schedule in much larger Milwaukee for more support (a practice they continued well into the 1990s). In 1941, the corporate headquarters moved from Columbus, Ohio to Chicago. During the early years of the league, rather than coming up with original team names, many NFL teams simply chose the name of the Major League Baseball team in the same city. Thus the Pittsburgh Steelers were the \\"Pittsburgh Pirates\\" for the first seven years of existence and other teams such as the Brooklyn Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, Cincinnati Reds, Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Buffalo Bisons all represented the NFL at one time or another.[10]\\r\\nAn annual draft of college players was first held in 1936.[11][12] The first televised NFL game was on October 22, 1939 in a game the Eagles lost 23-14 to the host Dodgers at Ebbets Field.[13][14] It was during this era, however, that the NFL became segregated: there were no black players in professional football in the United States between 1933 and 1945, mainly due to the influence of George Preston Marshall, who entered the league in 1932 as the owner of the Boston Braves. Other NFL owners emulated Marshall's whites-only policy to mollify southern fans, and even after the NFL's color barrier had been broken in the 1950s, Marshall's Washington Redskins remained all-white until forced to integrate by the Kennedy administration in 1962.[15] Despite his bigotry, Marshall was selected as a charter member of the NFL-inspired Pro Football Hall of Fame, primarily for the numerous innovations (fixed schedules, separate conferences and championship games) Marshall encouraged during his time in the league.\\r\\nCollege football was the bigger attraction, but by the end of World War II, pro football began to rival the college game for fans' attention. Rule changes and innovations such as the T formation led to a faster-paced, higher-scoring game. The league also expanded out of its eastern and midwestern cradle; in 1945, the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles, becoming the first big-league sports franchise on the West Coast.[16] In 1950, the NFL accepted three teams ÿ the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts ÿ from the defunct All-America Football Conference, expanding to thirteen clubs. For a three-month period in 1950 the league was renamed the National-American Football League, that was subsequently changed back.[17][18] In 1958, the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants played \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\" for the championship. Being the first nationally televised football game, along with its thrilling ending greatly increased the popularity of the NFL. Through these breakthroughs, pro football finally earned its place as a major sport.\\r\\nThe NFL's precursor, the American Professional Football Association, had several minority players, including African-American players: between 1920 and 1926, nine black players suited up for NFL squads. It was also common, due to the number of talented players that were produced by the Carlisle Indian School's football team, to see teams (both inside and outside the NFL) openly market Native Americans; in fact, the Oorang Indians of 1922 to 1923 consisted entirely of Native American talent. Running back Walter Achiu and quarterback Arthur Matsu, both of the Dayton Triangles, were the first Asian-American players in the NFL, having joined the league in 1927 and 1928 respectively. Ignacio Molinet and Jess Rodriguez were the first Hispanic players in the NFL and each played one season in 1927 and 1929 respectively.\\r\\nHowever, since Carlisle had closed in 1918, the talent pool of Indians had dried up. Meanwhile, all black players in the NFL (including future Hall of Famer Fritz Pollard) were summarily kicked out prior to the 1927 season for reasons unexplained. From 1928 to 1932, no more than one black player could be found in the league each season, and none played more than two seasons. In 1933, there were two: Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Lillard was kicked off the Chicago Cardinals for fighting, while Kemp left to pursue what would become a successful coaching career. The moves left the league as all-white, and Boston Redskins owner George Preston Marshall allegedly used his pressure to keep it that way for the next several years, though each team's internal politics and cronyism, as well as the rising tide of racism in the United States as a whole, also played a significant role. Even during the wartime years, when much of the NFL's talent was overseas fighting World War II, players such as Kenny Washington who stayed in the United States were still passed up in favor of white players with normally debilitating medical conditions such as partial blindness.[citation needed]\\r\\nNFL integration occurred only when the Cleveland Rams wanted to move to Los Angeles, and the venue, the Los Angeles Coliseum, required them to integrate their team. They then signed two black players, Kenny Washington and Woody Strode.[19] Other NFL teams eventually followed suit, but Marshall refused to integrate the Redskins until forced to by the Kennedy administration as a pre-condition for using D.C. Stadium (now RFK Stadium). In spite of this open bias, Marshall was elected to the NFL's Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963. In 1946, the Cleveland Browns of a rival Professional Football league, the All-America Football Conference, signed two black players. By 1960, the NFL's new competitor, the American Football League, actively recruited players from smaller predominantly black colleges that had been largely ignored by the NFL, giving those schools' black players the opportunity to play professional football. Early AFL teams averaged more blacks than did their NFL counterparts.[20]\\r\\nHowever, despite the NFL's previous segregationist policies, the clear competitive advantage of AFL teams with liberal signing policies affected the NFL's drafts. By 1969, a comparison of the two leagues' championship team photos showed the AFL's Chiefs with 23?black players out of 51?players (45%) pictured, while the NFL's Vikings had 11?blacks, of 42?players (26%) in the photo. Chiefs players have been quoted as saying that one motivating factor in their defeat of the Vikings in Super Bowl IV was their pride in their diverse squad. Recent surveys have shown that the current, post-merger NFL is approximately 67ÿ71% non-white (this includes African Americans, Polynesians, non-white Hispanics, Asians, and people that are mixed race), significantly higher than the national average; certain positions, such as cornerback and running back, are almost entirely black.\\r\\nIn 1946, after World War II, the struggling league had headquarters in Chicago. Commissioner Elmer Layden could not handle the pressure of the AFL set up in the same year. DeBenneville Bert Bell was hired to be the commissioner, and he accepted the office only on condition that the headquarters would move to Philadelphia.[21] Bell had played for the Eagles, and for Penn before that. Till 1959, when he died of a heart attack at SteelersÿEagles game at Franklin Field, the headquarters of NFL were on Walnut Street in Philadelphia, and Bert Bell had transformed the NFL into a commercial and popular success. Within a short period of his death, the NFL offices were moved to Manhattan, where they remain to this day. The NFL held a monopoly on professional football in the United States for most of the 1950s, a rare occurrence for a league that had at least one competing league in every year since 1934. By 1960, a group of potential professional football owners that would become known as the Foolish Club had become frustrated with their efforts to buy into the NFL (some were NFL franchise minority owners such as Harry Wismer and Ralph Wilson; others, such as Lamar Hunt and Bud Adams, had tried but failed to buy NFL teams) and formed a new league, the American Football League. It was the eighth professional football league to use the name and the fourth to be universally considered a major-league competitor to the NFL. The AFL would prove to be the NFL's most formidable challenger to date.\\r\\nBy the middle of the 1960s competition for players, including separate college drafts, was driving up player salaries. In 1965, in the most high-profile such contest and a major boost to the AFL, University of Alabama quarterback Joe Namath signed with the New York Jets rather than the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals for a then-record $427,000. In 1966, the NFL's New York Giants broke an informal agreement and signed placekicker Pete Gogolak, who was under contract to the AFL's Buffalo Bills. Then AFL Commissioner Al Davis embarked on a campaign to sign players away from the NFL, especially quarterbacks, but behind the scenes a number of NFL team owners began action to end the detrimental rivalry.\\r\\nSeveral NFL franchises led by Cowboys General Manager Tex Schramm asked to meet with AFL owners to negotiate a merger. In an agreement brokered by Schramm and AFL founder Lamar Hunt, the two leagues announced their merger deal on June 8, 1966. The leagues would thenceforth hold a Common Draft and an end-of-season World Championship Game between the two league champions (later known as the Super Bowl and reverting to simply an NFL championship game). Still another city received an NFL franchise thanks to the AFL, as New Orleans was awarded an NFL team after Louisiana's federal Congressmen pushed for the passage of Public Law 89-800, which permitted the merger and exempted the action from Anti-Trust restrictions. The monopoly that would be created needed to be legitimized by an act of Congress. In 1970, the leagues fully merged under the name National Football League and divided into two conferences of an equal number of teams. Since the pre-merger NFL had six more teams than the AFL, three NFL teams ÿ the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns, and Baltimore Colts ÿ moved to the AFC, the conference containing the AFL teams. Two other teams, the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were also added to the NFL as part of the merger agreement. (These two teams were not added until 1976; during the early 1970s, there were some concerns that several of the newly transplanted teams did not have stadiums big or modern enough to accommodate the NFL, and Seattle and Tampa Bay unsuccessfully attempted to court teams such as the Buffalo Bills and Boston Patriots to their cities. Once the Bills and Patriots built new stadiums and solidified their place in their home markets, the NFL awarded Seattle and Tampa Bay expansion franchises of their own.) There was also a financial settlement, with the AFL teams paying a combined $18 million over 20 years.\\r\\nAlthough the AFL's identity was subsumed by the NFL, the NFL eventually adopted many of the AFL's innovations including the on-field game clock, names on player jerseys, recruiting at small and predominantly black colleges, gate and television revenue-sharing, establishment of southern franchises, and more wide-open offensive rules.\\r\\nUnlike previous armed conflicts such as World War I and World War II, both of which effectively stopped or dramatically reduced the amount of professional football played in the United States, both the AFL and NFL were largely unaffected by the Vietnam War and did not lose a significant number of players to the war draft. There is at least one recorded incidence of the NFL using champagne units to keep its players from being sent overseas (the Dallas Cowboys used the Texas Air National Guard's 147th Fighter Interceptor Group, a well-known champagne unit to shield seven Cowboys players from combat in Vietnam).[22] Bob Kalsu, then a player with the AFL's Buffalo Bills, left the team to serve in Vietnam and died in combat; he was the only casualty of the Vietnam War that the league would sustain. (Don Steinbrunner, who briefly played for the Cleveland Browns, also died in Vietnam, but he left the NFL over a decade before his deployment there.)\\r\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the NFL solidified its dominance as America's top spectator sport,[citation needed] and its important role in American culture. The Super Bowl became an unofficial national holiday and the top-rated TV program most years. Monday Night Football, which first aired in 1970, brought in high ratings by mixing sports and entertainment. Rule changes in the late 1970s ensured a fast-paced game with lots of passing to attract the casual fan.\\r\\nThe World Football League was the first post-merger challenge to the NFL's dominance, and in 1974, successfully lured some top NFL talent to its league and prompted a few rules changes in the NFL. However, financial problems led the league to fold halfway through its 1975 season. Two teams, the Birmingham Vulcans and Memphis Southmen, made unsuccessful efforts to move from the WFL to the NFL.\\r\\nThe founding of the United States Football League in the early 1980s would prove to be the longest sustained challenge to the NFL's dominance since the 1970 merger, lasting three seasons. The USFL was a relatively well-financed competitor with big-name players and a national television contract, but overspending on that talent and a decision to move its niche spring operation into a head-to-head competition with the NFL in the fall (abandoning some of its biggest cities in the process) over the objections of many of its original owners were two major factors in the league's demise. The league's last-ditch effort to sue the NFL for hundreds of millions of dollars in antitrust damages, while a technical victory, failed to secure the funds the USFL needed to survive.\\r\\n2001 saw the establishment of the XFL, an attempt by Vince McMahon and NBC, which had lost the NFL broadcast rights for that year, to compete with the league; the XFL folded after just one season.[23] Unlike the WFL and USFL, the XFL had no impact on the NFL's rules or franchise locations (its attempts at innovations were often ridiculed, though one innovation, the above the field Skycam which originated in the XFL, became a regular part of NFL telecasts), but a few NFL players used the XFL to relaunch their careers.\\r\\nThe United Football League, which began play in 2009, had originally planned to take a direct challenge to the NFL with NFL-comparable salaries and teams in New York City and Los Angeles, but the UFL never did play in those cities (an ostensibly New York team played in Long Island and New Jersey), cut back its salaries, and instead opted for a complementary approach with teams in cities such as Las Vegas, Sacramento and Omaha; after four years, the UFL folded due to massive financial losses. Numerous other leagues have attempted to form over the years, but none have succeeded in having any level of competition comparable to the NFL (most never made it to their first game).\\r\\nOn August 31, 2007, a story in USA Today unveiled the first changes to the league's shield logo since 1980, which took effect with the 2008 season.[24] The redesign reduced the number of stars in the logo from 25[24] (which were found not to have a meaning beyond being decorative) to eight (for each of the league's divisions), repositioned the football in the manner of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, and changed the NFL letters to a straight, serifed font. The redesign was created with television and digital media, along with clothing, in mind. The shield logo itself dates back to the 1940s.\\r\\nIn 1987, through a short stint with NBC Sports, Gayle Sierens became the first woman to do play-by-play for an NFL regular season football game when she called the December 27 game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Kansas City Chiefs. She was originally to be a regular play-by-play announcer for the season, but a contract dispute with WFLA prevented her from continuing in that role beyond her lone game.[25] In May 2017, Beth Mowins was reported by Sports Illustrated's Richard Deitsch to be the chosen play-by-play announcer on ESPN's Monday Night Football opening week late broadcast between the Los Angeles Chargers and Denver Broncos.[26] She did that announcing job in September of that year, and thus became the first woman to call a nationally televised NFL game.[27]\\r\\nShannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, in a pre-season matchup between the Green Bay Packers and the San Diego Chargers.[28] In 2015 Sarah Thomas became the first full-time female official in NFL history.[29]\\r\\nOn March 3, 2013, Lauren Silberman became the first woman to ever try out for the NFL when she appeared as a kicker at the NFL Regional Scouting Combine in Florham Park, New Jersey.[30][31] However, after two poor kicks, Silberman left the field, citing an injury to her quadriceps; the tryout was suspected by members of the press and public as being nothing more than a publicity stunt.[32] Olympic pole-vaulter Jenn Suhr publicly expressed interest in attending an NFL scouting combine in 2014, and at least one team (the Buffalo Bills) acknowledged Suhr's interest favorably but did not invite her to a combine; Suhr did not indicate what position she would play.[33]\\r\\nOn July 27, 2015, the Arizona Cardinals hired Jennifer Welter as an assistant coaching intern for training camp and the preseason; as such, she is believed to be the first female coach in the NFL.[34][35] The Buffalo Bills hired Kathryn Smith as an assistant special teams coach for the 2016 season; thus Smith, who had long served as an assistant and front office staffer, became the first full-time female assistant coach in the NFL.[36][37] In 2017, Katie Sowers became an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers; later that year, while still working in that job, she came out as gay, thus becoming the NFL's first openly LGBT coach, and the first openly LGBT coach in all of U.S. men's professional sports.[38][39]\\r\\nWhile there have been a scattering of American professional female football players in semi-pro football (Patricia Palinkas, Katie Hnida, and the still active Julie Harshbarger among them) and female players in American college and high school football, no woman with prior experience as an American football player has attempted to make an NFL roster.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn recent years, the NFL has expanded into new markets and ventures outside of the United States, beginning with a regular series of exhibition games known as the American Bowl, then with a European-based developmental league culminating in the now defunct NFL Europa, and starting in 2005 the league began hosting regular season games outside the United States, the first in Mexico City, Mexico, and then from 2007 hosting games in London, England, and from 2008 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\\r\\nThe American Bowl games began in 1986 and continued until 2005 at various sites in countries around the world. Then in 1991, the league formed the World League of American Football, later known as NFL Europe and still later as NFL Europa, a developmental league that had teams in Britain, Germany, Spain, and the Netherlands. The NFL shut down the program in June 2007.\\r\\nThe league played a regular-season NFL game in Mexico City in 2005, the first-ever NFL regular season game held outside the United States, and marketed across the league as the F~tbol Americano game. On October 28, 2007, a regular season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Giants was held outside of North America for the first time in Wembley Stadium, the 90,000-seat national stadium, in London. It was a financial success with nearly 40,000 tickets sold within ninety minutes of the start of sales,[40] and a game-day attendance of over 80,000. In 2008, the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers played at Wembley,[41] and in October 2009, the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers met.[42] In 2010, it was the Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers that played in London. Starting from the 2008ÿ09 season, building on league links with Toronto, the Buffalo Bills play an annual home game in Toronto's Rogers Centre, marketed by the team as the Bills Toronto Series.[43] In 2014, the Detroit Lions and the Atlanta Falcons played at Wembley Stadium. In 2016, the Raiders and Texans played a game in Estadio Azteca, Mexico. The Raiders and Patriots will play here in 2017.\\r\\nAfter 100 years of American football influence in Mexican territory, in 1998 the NFL opened a representation office in Mexico, called NFL Mxico, as the NFL identified Mexico as a key market outside the United States due to proximity and tradition. The Mexican office handles sponsorship, licensing, detail dealers, sport culture, broadcasting, public relationships and community service.[44]\\r\\nIn the early years, the league was not stable and teams moved frequently. Franchise mergers were popular during World War II in response to the scarcity of players. An example of this was the Steagles, temporarily formed as a merger between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Philadelphia Eagles.\\r\\nFranchise moves became far more controversial in the late twentieth century when a vastly more popular NFL was free from financial instability and allowed many franchises to abandon long-held strongholds for perceived financially greener pastures. This was done in spite of the promises to Congress by Pete Rozelle in 1966 that if the AFLÿNFL merger were allowed, no city would lose its franchise. Those promises were made to ensure passage of PL 89-800, which granted anti-trust immunity to the merged professional football leagues. While owners invariably cited financial difficulties as the primary factor in such moves, many fans bitterly disputed these contentions, especially in Cleveland (the Rams and the Browns), Baltimore (the Colts), Houston (the Oilers), and St. Louis (the Cardinals), each of which eventually received teams some years after their original franchises left (the Browns, another Browns, Ravens, Texans, and Rams, respectively). Notably, the second-largest media market in the United States, Los Angeles, did not have an NFL team from 1994, after both the Raiders and the Rams relocated elsewhere, until 2016, when the Rams returned. The San Diego Chargers, who played their inaugural season in Los Angeles before spending the next 55 years in San Diego, returned to Los Angeles following the 2016 season. The Oakland Raiders (who themselves relocated to Los Angeles for a time in the 1980s and early 1990s) have a pending relocation to Las Vegas, Nevada that will take effect in 2019 or 2020. The driving force behind the 2010s relocations was not directly related to finances, as the league was lucrative and stable by this point; instead, the promise of better stadiums drove those relocations.\\r\\nWhile baseball is known as \\"America's national pastime,\\" football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States. According to the Harris Poll, professional football moved ahead of baseball as the fans' favorite in 1965, during the emergence of the NFL's challenger, the American Football League, as a major professional football league. Football has remained America's favorite sport ever since. In a Harris Poll conducted in 2008, the NFL was the favorite sport of as many people (30%) as the combined total of the next three professional sports ÿ baseball (15%), auto racing (10%), and hockey (5%).[45] Additionally, football's American television viewership ratings now surpass those of other sports, although football season comprises far fewer games than the seasons of other sports.[46]\\r\\nHowever, the Harris Poll only allows one unaided selection of a \\"favorite sport.\\" Other studies and polls such as the ESPN Sports Poll and the studies released by the Associated Press (AP) and conducted by Sports Marketing Group (SMG) from 1988 to 2004, show far higher levels of popularity for NFL football since they list from thirty to over 100 sports that each respondent must rate. According to the AP, the SMG polls from 1988 to 2004 show NFL football to be the most popular spectator sport in America. The AP stated that \\"In the most detailed survey ever of America's sports tastes\\" researching \\"114 spectator sports they might attend, follow on television or radio or read about in newspapers or magazines, the NFL topped all sports with 39 percent of Americans saying they loved it or considered it one of their favorites.\\"[47] In a 2003 study conducted by SMG and released by the AP, the NFL was loved or liked a lot by 42.8% of Americans over 18.[48][49]\\r\\nThe NFL has the highest per-game attendance of any domestic professional sports league in the world. The NFL's overall attendance, however, is only approximately 20 percent of Major League Baseball, because of the latter's longer schedule (162-game scheduled regular season).[50]\\r\\nA 2007 Turnkey Sports & Entertainment's Team Brand Index for \\"team loyalty\\" ranked NFL teams in twelve of the top twenty-five spots out of 122 total between the four major sports leagues. The Pittsburgh Steelers and their fanbase had the top spot, while the New England Patriots, and Indianapolis Colts had the following two spots, followed by the New Orleans Saints at number seven and the Green Bay Packers and their fanbase ranked at number ten.[51] The Arizona Cardinals finished last in the entire survey of 122 teams, though the survey was taken before the team's appearance against the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII.\\r\\nThe National Anthem controversy is the debate over whether the players should be able to kneel during the National Anthem or required to stand.[52] In October 2017 Papa Johns removed the \\"official sponsor\\" designation on their television advertising over disagreements with how the NFL handled the National Anthem protests.[53]\\r\\nBuffalo Bills\\r\\nMiami Dolphins\\r\\nNew England Patriots\\r\\nNew York Jets\\r\\nBaltimore Ravens\\r\\nCincinnati Bengals\\r\\nCleveland Browns\\r\\nPittsburgh Steelers\\r\\nHouston Texans\\r\\nIndianapolis Colts\\r\\nJacksonville Jaguars\\r\\nTennessee Titans\\r\\nDenver Broncos\\r\\nKansas City Chiefs\\r\\nLos Angeles Chargers\\r\\nOakland Raiders\\r\\nDallas Cowboys\\r\\nNew York Giants\\r\\nPhiladelphia Eagles\\r\\nWashington Redskins\\r\\nChicago Bears\\r\\nDetroit Lions\\r\\nGreen Bay Packers\\r\\nMinnesota Vikings\\r\\nAtlanta Falcons\\r\\nCarolina Panthers\\r\\nNew Orleans Saints\\r\\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\\r\\nArizona Cardinals\\r\\nLos Angeles Rams\\r\\nSan Francisco 49ers\\r\\nSeattle Seahawks","input":"What is the oldest football team in america?"},{"output":"unsportsmanlike conduct","context":"In basketball, a technical foul (also colloquially known as a \\"T\\" or a \\"Tech\\") is any infraction of the rules penalized as a foul which does not involve physical contact during the course of play between opposing players on the court, or is a foul by a non-player. The most common technical foul is for unsportsmanlike conduct. Technical fouls can be assessed against players, bench personnel, the entire team (often called a bench technical), or even the crowd. These fouls, and their penalties, are more serious than a personal foul, but not necessarily as serious as a flagrant foul (an ejectable offense in leagues below the NBA, and potentially so in the NBA).\\r\\nTechnical fouls are handled slightly differently under international rules than under the rules used by the various competitions in the United States. First, illegal contact between players on the court is always a personal foul under international rules, whereas in the USA, such contact is, with some exceptions, a technical foul when the game clock is not running and/or when the ball is dead. Second, in FIBA play (except for the half-court 3x3 variant, in which individual personal foul counts are not kept), players foul out after five total fouls, technical and personal combined (since 2014, one technical can be included towards the total; two technicals in a game results in ejection). The latter rule is similar to that in college, high school, and middle school basketball in the United States. However, in leagues that play 48-minute games such as the NBA, and in some leagues such as the WNBA, players are allowed six personal fouls before being disqualified, and technical fouls assessed against them do not count toward this total. However, unsportsmanlike technicals in the NBA carry a fine, its severity depending on the number of technicals the player has already obtained, and players are suspended for varying amounts of time after accumulating sixteen technicals in the regular season or seven in the playoffs.\\r\\nIn most American competitions, ejection of the offender, that of the player, coach, or otherwise, is the penalty for being assessed two technical fouls in a game, if charged directly to him/her (some technicals committed by a player are charged to the team only). In addition, any single flagrant technical foul, or a disqualifying foul in FIBA, incurs ejection. FIBA rules do not provide for ejection for any number of non-flagrant technicals (known as unsportsmanlike fouls under that body's rules) against a player, except in 3x3, in which two unsportsmanlike fouls result in ejection. FIBA rules call for ejection when a coach draws two technicals, or a third is called on the bench.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMany infractions can result in the calling of a technical foul. One of the most common is the use of profane language toward an official or another player. This can be called on either players who are currently active in the play of the game, or seated on a team's bench. It can also be assessed to a coach or another person associated with the team in an official capacity such as a trainer or an equipment manager. Additionally, coaches or players can be assessed a technical foul for disputing an official's call too vehemently, with or without the use of profanity. This verbal unsporting technical foul may be assessed regardless of whether the ball is dead or alive.\\r\\nOther offenses can result in technical fouls, such as:\\r\\nViolations of the rules for delaying the game (in the NBA, NCAA, and NFHS) usually incur a team warning for a first offense, followed by a team technical, or sometimes a player technical, if the same team delays a second time, to include:\\r\\nand more technical issues, such as:\\r\\nUntil 2001, the NBA also had a unique rule, the illegal defense, which was designed to stop defenders from dropping back into a zone and thus preventing drives to the basket. The penalty, after a warning, was a technical foul charged to the offending team and one shot for the offense, except that if the first violation occurred within 24 seconds of the end of a period, the technical was assessed without warning.\\r\\nBeginning with the 2001ÿ02?season, the NBA changed the illegal defense rule to the \\"defensive 3-second rule,\\" which prohibits a defender from being in the shooting lane for three seconds, unless guarding an opponent within arm's reach (or the man with the ball, regardless of distance). The penalty is the same as it was for an illegal defense, except that no warning is issued. The WNBA implemented this rule in 2013.\\r\\nAdditionally, home teams can be assessed technical fouls resulting from their partisans' misconduct for excessive use of artificial noise, the playing of music by their band, or for dangerous offenses such as throwing items (particularly ice or coins) onto the court.\\r\\nUsually a fight or lesser altercation between players results in a \\"double technical\\", in which a technical foul is issued to both players involved. If any player leaves the team bench during a fight, he can be charged with a technical foul and ejected, as can any coach that does so without the beckoning of an official. Rules against fighting vary from high school to college to the (W)NBA, but all levels penalize severely for such conduct, to include suspensions and (in the [W]NBA) heavy fines. NFHS and NCAA require the automatic ejection of bench personnel leaving the team area during a fight, whether or not these players actually participate in the fight.\\r\\nBeginning with the 2010ÿ11?season, the NBA began to crack down on general complaining. Technical fouls can now be issued for the following:[1]\\r\\nIn college basketball, NFHS, and lower divisions, the penalty for technical fouls has increased over the years. Initially, the opposing team was awarded one free throw. This later increased to one free throw and possession of the ball. For a while, \\"bench technicals\\" assessed on a non-active player, assistant coach, or anyone else on the team bench were considered more serious and resulted in the award of two shots. (Coaches have their own technical fouls, although they may be ejected and/or suspended if they have a mix of technicals totaling two or three fouls, depending on seriousness.)\\r\\nToday, high school basketball (NFHS in the United States) provides for two free throws and possession of the ball at the division line opposite the scorer's table, regardless of circumstances, for a technical foul. International basketball provides a similar penalty. Before the 2015ÿ16 season, college basketball awarded two shots for all technical fouls, with the ball then put in play at the point of interruption (POI), the spot and circumstances where play was stopped for the technical. Since 2015ÿ16, the NCAA awards only one free throw for so-called \\"Class B\\" technicals, such as hanging on the rim or delay of game; \\"Class A\\" technical fouls still result in two free throws. In the NBA and WNBA, the penalty remains one free throw for the opposing team, with play resuming from the point of interruption. The shot clock is reset to 14 seconds if it read less than such at the time of the foul. The team awarded the foul shots for a technical may select the player(s) to shoot them (this rule differs slightly from level to level and internationally), as opposed to personal fouls, where the player fouled, unless injured, must shoot his own foul shots.\\r\\nIn the NBA, technical fouls are split into two classes, unsportsmanlike and non-unsportsmanlike. A player assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul is fined, and accumulating sixteen unsportsmanlike technical fouls during the regular season will result in a one-game suspension.[2] For every two additional unsportsmanlike technical fouls received during that regular season, the player or coach will be automatically suspended for an additional game.[2] Penalties for unsportsmanlike technical fouls are even higher for playoffs games. Players and coaches will be fined for every unsportsmanlike technical foul they receive. Those who accumulate seven unsportsmanlike technical fouls will be suspended for one game. For every two additional unsportsmanlike technical fouls received, the player or coach will be automatically suspended for an additional game.[3]\\r\\nNon-unsportsmanlike conduct technical fouls are defined per NBA Rule 12, Section V, Paragraph c, and none count towards a fine, ejection or suspension. These fouls are assessed for excessive time-outs, defensive three seconds, scratched player dressing and playing, excessive personal fouls because team is out of players, shattering backboards, or delay of game. An offensive player who intentionally hangs on the backboard, unless it is legal for safety reasons, is fined $500 but is only assessed a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul.\\r\\nOne of the most famous technical fouls ever assessed was called on Chris Webber of the University of Michigan late in the 1993 NCAA championship game. Down by two points to North Carolina with only seconds remaining, Webber called a time-out when Michigan had none left. The resulting excessive time-out technical foul, for which North Carolina guard Donald Williams made both foul shots, ended any hopes Michigan had of claiming the championship.\\r\\nIn what has been called the greatest game ever played,[4] Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals between the Phoenix Suns and Boston Celtics, the Suns found themselves one point down with one second left in double overtime, no time-outs remaining and possession of the ball under their defensive basket after a John Havlicek bucket. Faced with the near-impossibility of sinking an 80-foot desperation shot, Suns guard Paul Westphal hit upon an unusual solution. He intentionally called a time-out the Suns did not have. While this gave the Celtics a free throw, which Jo Jo White successfully converted to increase the lead to two, it gave the Suns possession at halfcourt, and enabled Gar Heard to sink an 18-footer as time expired to force a third overtime. NBA rules were changed the following year to prevent a repeat occurrence.\\r\\nAn instance where many technical fouls could have been called, but were not (instead, the game was abandoned, a remedy available to the officials when too many players would have or have been disqualified or ejected for the game to continue, or when a team continually commits technical fouls in order to make a travesty of proceedings), was the PacersÿPistons brawl involving players and spectators on November 19, 2004, in an NBA game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. Ron Artest of the Pacers and Ben Wallace of the Pistons began scuffling after Artest fouled Wallace hard. This escalated into a brawl where players from both teams became involved, and grew worse after Artest retreated to the scorer's table and was hit by a cup thrown by a spectator. Artest and several teammates and opponents then ran into the stands and fought with fans. Had technical fouls been formally assessed, the result would likely have been the ejection of both teams' entire squads (except for Pistons player Tayshaun Prince, who was the only player from either team to remain on the bench for the entire incident). In the end, nine players were suspended for a total of 146 games, including Artest for the remainder of the season.[5]\\r\\nIn a 2007 game against the Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio's Tim Duncan was charged a technical foul by referee Joe Crawford for laughing at him while sitting on the bench (\\"gesturing in such a manner as to indicate resentment,\\" as indicated above). As he had already picked up a technical foul on the previous play, also while sitting on the bench, this led to his ejection. Upon further review it was determined that this technical foul was inconsistent with the league's game management, and NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Crawford for the rest of the season. Duncan was fined $25,000 for the incident.[6]\\r\\nThe most technical fouls ever charged to a team in a single professional game is 6 (all in the second half), to Aris Thessaloniki in a game against Olympiacos of the Greek A1 League on February 10, 2008.\\r\\nRasheed Wallace holds the record for the most technical fouls received during one season in the NBA. In the 2000ÿ01 season, he received 41 technical fouls in 80 regular season and postseason games played. Wallace also holds the all-time mark for most technical fouls by a player in a career with 317, a record previously held by Dennis Rodman.[7][8]\\r\\nThere have been a few instances in the NBA when a team's entire bench has either been injured or fouled out, and one of the five remaining eligible players fouls out, resulting in the technical foul that effectively acts as a bonus free throw situation. The Atlanta Hawks' Cliff Levingston (fouled out, but one of the five remaining players was ejected) and the Los Angeles Lakers' Robert Sacre (fouled out) have both taken advantage[clarification needed] of the disqualified player rule. Under NBA Rule 3-I-a (player fouls out) and 3-I-b (player injured or ejected), the player was assessed with a technical foul for remaining in the game or returning to the game after fouling out.","input":"What can you get a technical foul for?"},{"output":"Carolyn W.

It is 96 miles (154?km) south of Seattle, Washington, and 50 miles (80?km) northeast of Portland, Oregon. Mount St.?Helens takes its English name from the British diplomat Lord St?Helens, a friend of explorer George Vancouver who made a survey of the area in the late 18th century.[1] The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes. This volcano is well known for its ash explosions and pyroclastic flows.\\r\\nMount St. Helens is most notorious for its major 1980 eruption, the deadliest and most economically destructive volcanic event in the history of the United States.[2] Fifty-seven people were killed; 250 homes, 47 bridges, 15 miles (24?km) of railways, and 185 miles (298?km) of highway were destroyed. A massive debris avalanche triggered by an earthquake measuring 5.1 on the Richter scale caused an eruption[3] that reduced the elevation of the mountain's summit from 9,677?ft (2,950?m) to 8,363?ft (2,549?m), leaving a 1 mile (1.6?km) wide horseshoe-shaped crater.[4] The debris avalanche was up to 0.7 cubic miles (2.9?km3) in volume. The Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument was created to preserve the volcano and allow for its aftermath to be scientifically studied.\\r\\nAs with most other volcanoes in the Cascade Range, Mount St.?Helens is a large eruptive cone consisting of lava rock interlayered with ash, pumice, and other deposits. The mountain includes layers of basalt and andesite through which several domes of dacite lava have erupted. The largest of the dacite domes formed the previous summit, and off its northern flank sat the smaller Goat Rocks dome. Both were destroyed in the 1980 eruption.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMount St. Helens is 34 miles (55?km) west of Mount Adams, in the western part of the Cascade Range. These \\"sister and brother\\" volcanic mountains are approximately 50 miles (80?km) from Mount Rainier, the highest of Cascade volcanoes. Mount Hood, the nearest major volcanic peak in Oregon, is 60 miles (100?km) southeast of Mount St.?Helens.\\r\\nMount St. Helens is geologically young compared with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago.[5] The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the Holocene epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).[6]\\r\\nPrior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens was the fifth-highest peak in Washington. It stood out prominently from surrounding hills because of the symmetry and extensive snow and ice cover of the pre-1980 summit cone, earning it the nickname \\"Fuji-san of America\\".[7] The peak rose more than 5,000 feet (1,500?m) above its base, where the lower flanks merge with adjacent ridges. The mountain is 6 miles (9.7?km) across at its base, which is at an elevation of 4,400 feet (1,300?m) on the northeastern side and 4,000 feet (1,200?m) elsewhere. At the pre-eruption tree line, the width of the cone was 4 miles (6.4?km).\\r\\nStreams that originate on the volcano enter three main river systems: the Toutle River on the north and northwest, the Kalama River on the west, and the Lewis River on the south and east. The streams are fed by abundant rain and snow. The average annual rainfall is 140 inches (3,600?mm), and the snow pack on the mountain's upper slopes can reach 16 feet (4.9?m).[8] The Lewis River is impounded by three dams for hydroelectric power generation. The southern and eastern sides of the volcano drain into an upstream impoundment, the Swift Reservoir, which is directly south of the volcano's peak.\\r\\nAlthough Mount St. Helens is in Skamania County, Washington, access routes to the mountain run through Cowlitz County to the west. State Route 504, locally known as the Spirit Lake Memorial Highway, connects with Interstate?5 at Exit 49, 34 miles (55?km) to the west of the mountain. That northÿsouth highway skirts the low-lying cities of Castle Rock, Longview and Kelso along the Cowlitz River, and passes through the Vancouver, WashingtonÿPortland, Oregon metropolitan area less than 50 miles (80?km) to the southwest. The community nearest the volcano is Cougar, Washington, in the Lewis River valley 11 miles (18?km) south-southwest of the peak. Gifford Pinchot National Forest surrounds Mount St.?Helens.\\r\\nDuring the winter of 1980ÿ1981, a new glacier appeared. Now officially named Crater Glacier, it was formerly known as the Tulutson Glacier. Shadowed by the crater walls and fed by heavy snowfall and repeated snow avalanches, it grew rapidly (14 feet (4.3?m) per year in thickness). By 2004, it covered about 0.36 square miles (0.93?km2), and was divided by the dome into a western and eastern lobe. Typically, by late summer, the glacier looks dark from rockfall from the crater walls and ash from eruptions. As of 2006, the ice had an average thickness of 300 feet (100?m) and a maximum of 650 feet (200?m), nearly as deep as the much older and larger Carbon Glacier of Mount Rainier. The ice is all postÿ1980, making the glacier very young geologically. However, the volume of the new glacier is about the same as all the preÿ1980 glaciers combined.[10][11][12][13][14]\\r\\nWith the recent volcanic activity starting in 2004, the glacier lobes were pushed aside and upward by the growth of new volcanic domes. The surface of the glacier, once mostly without crevasses, turned into a chaotic jumble of icefalls heavily criss-crossed with crevasses and seracs caused by movement of the crater floor.[15] The new domes have almost separated the Crater Glacier into an eastern and western lobe. Despite the volcanic activity, the termini of the glacier have still advanced, with a slight advance on the western lobe and a more considerable advance on the more shaded eastern lobe. Due to the advance, two lobes of the glacier joined together in late May 2008 and thus the glacier completely surrounds the lava domes.[15][16][17] In addition, since 2004, new glaciers have formed on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice onto its surface below; there are two rock glaciers to the north of the eastern lobe of Crater Glacier.[18] Crater Glacier is the only known advancing glacier in the contiguous United States.[19]\\r\\nThe early eruptive stages of Mount St. Helens are known as the \\"Ape Canyon Stage\\" (around 40,000ÿ35,000 years ago), the \\"Cougar Stage\\" (ca. 20,000ÿ18,000 years ago), and the \\"Swift Creek Stage\\" (roughly 13,000ÿ8,000 years ago).[20] The modern period, since about 2500 BCE, is called the \\"Spirit Lake Stage\\". Collectively, the preÿSpirit Lake stages are known as the \\"ancestral stages\\". The ancestral and modern stages differ primarily in the composition of the erupted lavas; ancestral lavas consisted of a characteristic mixture of dacite and andesite, while modern lava is very diverse (ranging from olivine basalt to andesite and dacite).[21]\\r\\nSt. Helens started its growth in the Pleistocene 37,600 years ago, during the Ape Canyon stage, with dacite and andesite eruptions of hot pumice and ash.[21] 36,000 years ago a large mudflow cascaded down the volcano;[21] mudflows were significant forces in all of St. Helens' eruptive cycles. The Ape Canyon eruptive period ended around 35,000 years ago and was followed by 17,000 years of relative quiet. Parts of this ancestral cone were fragmented and transported by glaciers 14,000 to 18,000 years ago during the last glacial period of the current ice age.[21]\\r\\nThe second eruptive period, the Cougar Stage, started 20,000 years ago and lasted for 2,000 years.[21] Pyroclastic flows of hot pumice and ash along with dome growth occurred during this period. Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset by the beginning of the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.\\r\\nA dormancy of about 4,000 years was broken around 2500 BCE with the start of the Smith Creek eruptive period, when eruptions of large amounts of ash and yellowish-brown pumice covered thousands of square miles. An eruption in 1900 BCE was the largest known eruption from St. Helens during the Holocene epoch, judged by the volume of one of the tephra layers from that period. This eruptive period lasted until about 1600 BCE and left 18 inches (46?cm) deep deposits of material 50 miles (80?km) distant in what is now Mt. Rainier National Park. Trace deposits have been found as far northeast as Banff National Park in Alberta, and as far southeast as eastern Oregon.[22] All told there may have been up to 2.5 cubic miles (10?km3) of material ejected in this cycle.[22] Some 400 years of dormancy followed.\\r\\nSt. Helens came alive again around 1200 BCE  the Pine Creek eruptive period.[22] This lasted until about 800 BCE and was characterized by smaller-volume eruptions. Numerous dense, nearly red hot pyroclastic flows sped down St. Helens' flanks and came to rest in nearby valleys. A large mudflow partly filled 40 miles (64?km) of the Lewis River valley sometime between 1000 BCE and 500 BCE.\\r\\nThe next eruptive period, the Castle Creek period, began about 400 BCE, and is characterized by a change in composition of St. Helens' lava, with the addition of olivine and basalt.[23] The pre-1980 summit cone started to form during the Castle Creek period. Significant lava flows in addition to the previously much more common fragmented and pulverized lavas and rocks (tephra) distinguished this period. Large lava flows of andesite and basalt covered parts of the mountain, including one around the year 100 BCE that traveled all the way into the Lewis and Kalama river valleys.[23] Others, such as Cave Basalt (known for its system of lava tubes), flowed up to 9 miles (14?km) from their vents.[23] During the first century, mudflows moved 30 miles (50?km) down the Toutle and Kalama river valleys and may have reached the Columbia River. Another 400 years of dormancy ensued.\\r\\nThe Sugar Bowl eruptive period was short and markedly different from other periods in Mount St. Helens history. It produced the only unequivocal laterally directed blast known from Mount St. Helens before the 1980 eruptions.[24] During Sugar Bowl time, the volcano first erupted quietly to produce a dome, then erupted violently at least twice producing a small volume of tephra, directed-blast deposits, pyroclastic flows, and lahars.[24]\\r\\nRoughly 700 years of dormancy were broken in about 1480, when large amounts of pale gray dacite pumice and ash started to erupt, beginning the Kalama period. The eruption in 1480 was several times larger than the May 18, 1980, eruption.[24] In 1482, another large eruption rivaling the 1980 eruption in volume is known to have occurred.[24] Ash and pumice piled 6 miles (9.7?km) northeast of the volcano to a thickness of 3 feet (0.9?m); 50 miles (80?km) away, the ash was 2 inches (5?cm) deep. Large pyroclastic flows and mudflows subsequently rushed down St. Helens' west flanks and into the Kalama River drainage system.\\r\\nThis 150-year period next saw the eruption of less silica-rich lava in the form of andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers.[23] Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank.[23] Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an explosion crater already at the summit.[25] Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647.[25] The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.\\r\\nThe 57-year eruptive period that started in 1800 was named after the Goat Rocks dome, and is the first time that both oral and written records exist.[25] Like the Kalama period, the Goat Rocks period started with an explosion of dacite tephra, followed by an andesite lava flow, and culminated with the emplacement of a dacite dome. The 1800 eruption probably rivalled the 1980 eruption in size, although it did not result in massive destruction of the cone. The ash drifted northeast over central and eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana. There were at least a dozen reported small eruptions of ash from 1831 to 1857, including a fairly large one in 1842. The vent was apparently at or near Goat Rocks on the northeast flank.[25] Goat Rocks dome was the site of the bulge in the 1980 eruption, and it was obliterated in the major eruption event on May 18, 1980 that destroyed the entire north face and top 1,300 feet (400?m) of the mountain.\\r\\nOn March 20, 1980, Mount St. Helens experienced a magnitude 4.2 earthquake;[2] and, on March 27, steam venting started.[26] By the end of April, the north side of the mountain had started to bulge.[27] On May 18, a second earthquake, of magnitude 5.1, triggered a massive collapse of the north face of the mountain. It was the largest known debris avalanche in recorded history. The magma in St. Helens burst forth into a large-scale pyroclastic flow that flattened vegetation and buildings over 230 square miles (600?km2). More than 1.5 million metric tons of sulfur dioxide was released into the atmosphere.[28] On the Volcanic Explosivity Index scale, the eruption was rated a five, and categorized as a Plinian eruption.\\r\\nThe collapse of the northern flank of St. Helens mixed with ice, snow, and water to create lahars (volcanic mudflows). The lahars flowed many miles down the Toutle and Cowlitz Rivers, destroying bridges and lumber camps. A total of 3,900,000 cubic yards (3,000,000?m3) of material was transported 17 miles (27?km) south into the Columbia River by the mudflows.[29]\\r\\nFor more than nine hours, a vigorous plume of ash erupted, eventually reaching 12 to 16 miles (20 to 27?km) above sea level.[30] The plume moved eastward at an average speed of 60 miles per hour (100?km/h) with ash reaching Idaho by noon. Ashes from the eruption were found collecting on top of cars and roofs next morning, as far as the city of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada.\\r\\nBy about 5:30?p.m. on May 18, the vertical ash column declined in stature, and less severe outbursts continued through the night and for the next several days. The St. Helens May 18 eruption released 24 megatons of thermal energy;[3][31] it ejected more than 0.67 cubic miles (2.79?km3) of material.[3] The removal of the north side of the mountain reduced St. Helens' height by about 1,300 feet (400?m) and left a crater 1 mile (1.6?km) to 2 miles (3.2?km) wide and 0.5 miles (800?m) deep, with its north end open in a huge breach. The eruption killed 57 people, nearly 7,000 big game animals (deer, elk, and bear), and an estimated 12 million fish from a hatchery.[8] It destroyed or extensively damaged over 200 homes, 185 miles (298?km) of highway and 15 miles (24?km) of railways.[8]\\r\\nBetween 1980 and 1986, activity continued at Mount St. Helens, with a new lava dome forming in the crater. Numerous small explosions and dome-building eruptions occurred. From December 7, 1989, to January 6, 1990, and from November 5, 1990, to February 14, 1991, the mountain erupted with sometimes huge clouds of ash.[32]\\r\\nMagma reached the surface of the volcano about October 11, 2004, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome's south side. This new dome continued to grow throughout 2005 and into 2006. Several transient features were observed, such as a lava spine nicknamed the \\"whaleback,\\" which comprised long shafts of solidified magma being extruded by the pressure of magma beneath. These features were fragile and broke down soon after they were formed. On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.[33]\\r\\nMount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a 36,000-foot (11,000?m) plume of steam and ash emergedvisible from Seattle.[34] This relatively minor eruption was a release of pressure consistent with ongoing dome building. The release was accompanied by a magnitude 2.5 earthquake.\\r\\nAnother feature to emerge from the dome was called the \\"fin\\" or \\"slab.\\" Approximately half the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as 6?ft (2?m) per day.[35][36] In mid-June 2006, the slab was crumbling in frequent rockfalls, although it was still being extruded. The height of the dome was 7,550 feet (2,300?m), still below the height reached in July 2005 when the whaleback collapsed.\\r\\nOn October 22, 2006, at 3:13?p.m. PST, a magnitude 3.5 earthquake broke loose Spine 7. The collapse and avalanche of the lava dome sent an ash plume 2,000 feet (600?m) over the western rim of the crater; the ash plume then rapidly dissipated.\\r\\nOn December 19, 2006, a large white plume of condensing steam was observed, leading some media people to assume there had been a small eruption. However, the Cascades Volcano Observatory of the USGS did not mention any significant ash plume.[37] The volcano was in continuous eruption from October 2004, but this eruption consisted in large part of a gradual extrusion of lava forming a dome in the crater.\\r\\nOn January 16, 2008, steam began seeping from a fracture on top of the lava dome. Associated seismic activity was the most noteworthy since 2004. Scientists suspended activities in the crater and the mountain flanks, but the risk of a major eruption was deemed low.[38] By the end of January, the eruption paused; no more lava was being extruded from the lava dome. On July 10, 2008, it was determined that the eruption had ended, after more than six months of no volcanic activity.[39]\\r\\nAmerican Indian lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of these is the Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitat people. In their tale, the chief of all the gods and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search for a suitable area to settle.[40]\\r\\nThey came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land, so to solve the dispute their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow  one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. The chief of the gods then built the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically.[40]\\r\\nWhen the two sons of the chief of the gods fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the cascades of the Columbia River Gorge.[41]\\r\\nFor punishment, the chief of the gods struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood. Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough, which means \\"smoking or fire mountain\\" in their language (the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit).[42]\\r\\nThe mountain is also of sacred importance to the Cowlitz and Yakama tribes that also historically lived in the area. They find the area above its tree line to be of exceptional spiritual significance, and the mountain (which they call \\"Lawetlat'la\\", roughly translated as \\"the smoker\\") features prominently in their creation myth, and in some of their songs and rituals. In recognition of this cultural significance, over 12,000 acres (4,900?ha) of the mountain (roughly bounded by the Loowit Trail) have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[43]\\r\\nOther area tribal names for the mountain include \\"n?hk\\" (\\"water coming out\\") from the Upper Chehalis, and \\"aka akn\\" (\\"snow mountain\\"), a Kiksht term.[43]\\r\\nRoyal Navy Commander George Vancouver and the officers of HMS Discovery made the Europeans' first recorded sighting of Mount St. Helens on May 19, 1792, while surveying the northern Pacific Ocean coast. Vancouver named the mountain for British diplomat Alleyne Fitzherbert, 1st Baron St Helens on October 20, 1792,[42][44] as it came into view when the Discovery passed into the mouth of the Columbia River.\\r\\nYears later, explorers, traders, and missionaries heard reports of an erupting volcano in the area. Geologists and historians determined much later that the eruption took place in 1800, marking the beginning of the 57-year-long Goat Rocks Eruptive Period (see geology section).[25] Alarmed by the \\"dry snow,\\" the Nespelem tribe of northeastern Washington danced and prayed rather than collecting food and suffered during that winter from starvation.[25]\\r\\nIn late 1805 and early 1806, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River but did not report either an ongoing eruption or recent evidence of one.[45] They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions at the mouth of the Sandy River near Portland, suggesting an eruption by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades.\\r\\nIn 1829 Hall J. Kelley led a campaign to rename the Cascade Range as the President's Range and also to rename each major Cascade mountain after a former President of the United States. In his scheme Mount St. Helens was to be renamed Mount Washington.[46]\\r\\nThe first authenticated eyewitness report of a volcanic eruption was made in March 1835 by Meredith Gairdner, while working for the Hudson's Bay Company stationed at Fort Vancouver.[47] He sent an account to the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, which published his letter in January 1836. James Dwight Dana of Yale University, while sailing with the United States Exploring Expedition, saw the quiescent peak from off the mouth of the Columbia River in 1841. Another member of the expedition later described \\"cellular basaltic lavas\\" at the mountain's base.[48]\\r\\nIn late fall or early winter of 1842, nearby settlers and missionaries witnessed the so-called \\"Great Eruption\\". This small-volume outburst created large ash clouds, and mild explosions followed for 15 years.[49] The eruptions of this period were likely phreatic (steam explosions). Josiah Parrish in Champoeg, Oregon witnessed Mount St. Helens in eruption on November 22, 1842. Ash from this eruption may have reached The Dalles, Oregon, 48 miles (80?km) southeast of the volcano.[6]\\r\\nIn October 1843, future California governor Peter H. Burnett recounted a story of an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident.[50] British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, and two years later Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent about a third of the way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.[51]\\r\\nOn April 17, 1857, the Republican, a Steilacoom, Washington, newspaper, reported that \\"Mount St. Helens, or some other mount to the southward, is seen ... to be in a state of eruption\\".[52] The lack of a significant ash layer associated with this event indicates that it was a small eruption. This was the first reported volcanic activity since 1854.[52]\\r\\nBefore the 1980 eruption, Spirit Lake offered year-round recreational activities. In the summer there was boating, swimming, and camping, while in the winter there was skiing.\\r\\nFifty-seven people were killed during the eruption.[53] Had the eruption occurred one day later, when loggers would have been at work, rather than on a Sunday, the death toll could have been much higher.[8]\\r\\n83-year-old Harry R. Truman, who had lived near the mountain for 54 years, became famous when he decided not to evacuate before the impending eruption, despite repeated pleas by local authorities. His body was never found after the eruption.\\r\\nAnother victim of the eruption was 30-year-old volcanologist David A. Johnston, who was stationed on the nearby Coldwater Ridge. Moments before his position was hit by the pyroclastic flow, Johnston radioed his famous last words: \\"Vancouver! Vancouver! This is it!\\"[54] Johnston's body was never found.\\r\\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter surveyed the damage and said, \\"Someone said this area looked like a moonscape. But the moon looks more like a golf course compared to what's up there.\\"[55] A film crew, led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber, was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their compasses, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by National Guard helicopter pilots. Their film, The Eruption of Mount St. Helens, later became a popular documentary.\\r\\nIn 1982, President Ronald Reagan and the U.S. Congress established the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a 110,000 acres (45,000?ha) area around the mountain and within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.[56]\\r\\nFollowing the 1980 eruption, the area was left to gradually return to its natural state. In 1987, the U.S. Forest Service reopened the mountain to climbing. It remained open until 2004 when renewed activity caused the closure of the area around the mountain (see Geological history section above for more details).\\r\\nMost notable was the closure of the Monitor Ridge trail, which previously let up to 100 permitted hikers per day climb to the summit. On July 21, 2006, the mountain was again opened to climbers.[57] In February 2010, a climber died after falling from the rim into the crater.[58]\\r\\nThe mountain is now circled by the Loowit Trail at elevations of 4000ÿ4900 feet. The northern segment of the trail from the South Fork Toutle River on the west to Windy Pass on the east is a restricted zone where camping, biking, pets, fires, and off-trail excursions are all prohibited.[59][60]\\r\\nMount St. Helens is a popular climbing destination for both beginning and experienced mountaineers. The peak is climbed year-round, although it is more often climbed from late spring through early fall. All routes include sections of steep, rugged terrain.[61] A permit system has been in place for climbers since 1987. A climbing permit is required year-round for anyone who will be above 4,800 feet (1,500?m) on the slopes of Mount St. Helens.[62]\\r\\nThe standard hiking/mountaineering route in the warmer months is the Monitor Ridge Route, which starts at the Climbers Bivouac. This is the most popular and crowded route to the summit in the summer and gains about 4,600 feet (1,400?m) in approximately 5 miles (8.0?km) to reach the crater rim.[63] Although strenuous, it is considered non-technical climb that involves some scrambling. Most climbers complete the round trip in 7 to 12 hours.[64]\\r\\nThe Worm Flows Route is considered the standard winter route on Mount St. Helens, as it is the most direct route to the summit. The route gains about 5,700 feet (1,700?m) in elevation over about 6 miles (9.7?km) from trailhead to summit but does not demand the technical climbing that some other Cascade peaks like Mount Rainier do. The \\"Worm Flows\\" part of the route name refers to the rocky lava flows that surround the route.[65] This route can be accessed via the Marble Mountain Sno-Park and the Swift Ski Trail.[66]","input":"What type of lava did mt st helens have?"},{"output":"The Great Red Spot","context":"The Great Red Spot is a persistent high-pressure region in the atmosphere of Jupiter, producing an anticyclonic storm 22 south of the planet's equator. It has been continuously observed for 188 years, since 1830.[1] Earlier observations from 1665 to 1713 are believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least 350 years.[2][3] Such storms are not uncommon within the turbulent atmospheres of gas giants.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665, but the present spot was first seen only after 1830 and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879. The storm people had seen in the 1600s may have been a different storm than the one we see today.[4] A long gap separates its period of current study after 1830 from its seventeenth-century discovery; whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or even if the observational record was simply poor, are all unknown.[5]\\r\\nFor example, its first sighting is often credited to Robert Hooke, who described a spot on the planet in May 1664; however, it is likely that Hooke's spot was in the wrong belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, versus the current Great Red Spot's location in the South Equatorial Belt). Much more convincing is Giovanni Cassini's description of a \\"permanent spot\\" the following year.[6] With fluctuations in visibility, Cassini's spot was observed from 1665 to 1713; however, the 118-year observational gap makes the identity of the two spots inconclusive, and the older spot's shorter observational history and slower motion than the modern spot make their identity unlikely.[7]\\r\\nA minor mystery concerns a Jovian spot depicted in a 1711 canvas by Donato Creti, which is exhibited in the Vatican.[8][9] Part of a series of panels in which different (magnified) heavenly bodies serve as backdrops for various Italian scenes, and all overseen by the astronomer Eustachio Manfredi for accuracy, Creti's painting is the first known to depict the Great Red Spot as red. No Jovian feature was explicitly described as red before the late 1800s.[9]\\r\\nOn February 25, 1979,[10] when the Voyager 1 spacecraft was 9.2 million kilometres (5.7 million miles) from Jupiter it transmitted the first detailed image of the Great Red Spot back to Earth. Cloud details as small as 160 kilometres (100 miles) across were visible. The colorful, wavy cloud pattern seen to the left (west) of the Red Spot is a region of extraordinarily complex and variable wave motion.\\r\\nAt the start of 2004, the Great Red Spot had approximately half the longitudinal extent it had a century ago, when it reached a size of 40,000 kilometres. At the present rate of reduction it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal fluctuations.[11]\\r\\nA smaller spot, designated Oval BA, formed recently (March 2000) from the merger of three white ovals,[12][13] has turned reddish in color. Astronomers have named it the Little Red Spot or Red, Jr. As of June 5, 2006, the Great Red Spot and Oval BA appeared to be approaching convergence.[14] The storms pass each other about every two years but the passings of 2002 and 2004 were of little significance. Amy Simon-Miller, of the Goddard Space Flight Center, predicted the storms would have their closest passing on July 4, 2006. She worked with Imke de Pater and Phil Marcus of UC Berkeley, and a team of professional astronomers since April 2006 to study the storms using the Hubble Space Telescope; on July 20, the two storms were photographed passing each other by the Gemini Observatory without converging.[15] In May 2008 a third storm turned red.[16]\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot should not be confused with the Great Dark Spot, a feature observed near the northern pole of Jupiter in 2000 with the CassiniÿHuygens spacecraft.[17] Note that a feature in the atmosphere of Neptune was also called the Great Dark Spot. The latter feature was imaged by Voyager 2 in 1989, and may have been an atmospheric hole rather than a storm and it was no longer present as of 1994 (although a similar spot had appeared farther to the north).\\r\\nNASA's Juno Spacecraft flew over the Great Red Spot on July 11, 2017, taking several images of the Spot from about 5,000 miles (8,000?km) above the surface.[18]\\r\\nThe oval object rotates counter-clockwise, with a period of about six Earth days[19] or fourteen Jovian days. Measuring in at 10,159 miles (16,350 kilometers) in width (as of April 3, 2017) Jupiter's Great Red Spot is 1.3 times as wide as Earth.[20] The cloud-tops of this storm are about eight kilometres above the surrounding cloud-tops.\\r\\nInfrared data have long indicated that the Great Red Spot is colder (and thus, higher in altitude) than most of the other clouds on the planet.[21] However, recent infrared measurements of the upper atmosphere show far more heat above the Great Red Spot than the rest of the planet; \\"acoustic waves\\" rising from the storm have been proposed as an explanation for Jupiter's temperature.[22]\\r\\nCareful tracking of atmospheric features revealed the spot's counter-clockwise circulation as far back as 1966, observations dramatically confirmed by the first time-lapse movies from the Voyager fly-bys.[23] The spot is confined by a modest eastward jet stream to its south and a very strong westward one to its north.[24] Though winds around the edge of the spot peak at ~120 metres per second (432 kilometres per hour), currents inside it seem stagnant, with little inflow or outflow.[25] The rotation period of the spot has decreased with time, perhaps as a direct result of its steady reduction in size.[26]\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records, typically varying by about a degree. Its longitude, however, is subject to constant variation.[27][28] Because Jupiter does not rotate uniformly at all latitudes, astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude. System II is used for latitudes of more than 10, and was originally based on the average rotation rate of the Great Red Spot of 9h?55m?42s.[29][30] Despite this, however, the spot has \\"lapped\\" the planet in System II at least 10 times since the early nineteenth century. Its drift rate has changed dramatically over the years and has been linked to the brightness of the South Equatorial Belt, and the presence or absence of a South Tropical Disturbance.[31]\\r\\nIt is not known exactly what causes the Great Red Spot's reddish color. Theories supported by laboratory experiments suppose that the color may be caused by complex organic molecules, red phosphorus, or a compound containing sulphur, but a consensus has yet to be reached.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Great Red Spot varies greatly in hue, from almost brick-red to pale salmon, or even white. In fact, the spot occasionally \\"disappears\\", becoming evident only through the Red Spot Hollow, which is its niche[clarify] in the South Equatorial Belt (SEB). Its visibility is apparently coupled to the SEB; when the belt is bright white, the spot tends to be dark, and when it is dark, the spot is usually light. These periods when the spot is dark or light occur at irregular intervals; as of 1997, during the preceding 50 years, the spot was darkest in the periods 1961ÿ1966, 1968ÿ1975, 1989ÿ1990, and 1992ÿ1993.[5]\\r\\nThere is no definitive theory as to what is causing the formation or color of the storm that is known as the Great Red Spot. Laboratory studies are examining the effects that cosmic rays or UV Light from the Sun are having on the chemical composition of the clouds of Jupiter. In particular whether the Sun's radiation is reacting with ammonium hydrosulfide in the planet's outer atmosphere to create the deep red color.[32] Research has shown that the storm produces extreme amounts of heat because it is simultaneously generating gravity waves and acoustic waves. When these turbulent energy waves collide 500?mi (800?km) above the red spot, they are creating extremely high temperatures in the planet's upper atmosphere. The effect is described as being like \\"crashing [..] ocean waves on a beach\\".[33] The reason the storm has continued to exist for centuries is because of the physical nature of Jupiter. As there is no planetary surface to provide friction (only a liquid core of hydrogen), circulating gas eddies persist for a very long time in the atmosphere because there is nothing to oppose their angular momentum.[34]\\r\\nIn ''Ice Age: Collision Course'', the Spot is created when Mars hit Jupiter and bounced off.","input":"What is the red dot on jupiter called?"},{"output":"fly agaric","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\ncap is flat\\r\\n\\r\\nedibility: poisonous\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria, commonly known as the fly agaric or fly amanita, is a basidiomycete mushroom, one of many in the genus Amanita. It is also a muscimol mushroom. Native throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, Amanita muscaria has been unintentionally introduced to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a symbiont with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true cosmopolitan species. It associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nArguably the most iconic toadstool species, the fly agaric is a large white-gilled, white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough classified as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboilingwhich weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substancesit is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituents being the compounds ibotenic acid and muscimol. The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of the mushroom in many European languages is thought to be derived from its use as an insecticide when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from Germanic-  and Slavic-speaking parts of Europe, as well as the Vosges region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.[5]:198 Albertus Magnus was the first to record it in his work De vegetabilibus some time before 1256,[6] commenting vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas, \\"it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies.\\"[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 16th-century Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to Frankfurt in Germany,[8] while Carl Linnaeus, the \\"father of taxonomy\\", reported it from Sm?land in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child.[9] He described it in volume two of his Species Plantarum in 1753, giving it the name Agaricus muscarius,[10] the specific epithet deriving from Latin musca meaning \\"fly\\".[11] It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus Amanita by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, a name sanctioned in 1821 by the \\"father of mycology\\", Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries. The starting date for all the mycota had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then Amanita muscaria (L.:Fr.) Hook. The 1987 edition of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work.[12] Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of Amanita muscaria (L.) Lam..\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported that Amanita muscaria was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and bug agaric was an old alternative name for the species.[7] French mycologist Pierre Bulliard reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work Histoire des plantes vnneuses et suspectes de la France (1784), and proposed a new binomial name Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus because of this.[5]:200 One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein ( 1,3-Di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.[13]\\r\\nIt has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.[14]\\r\\nAn alternative derivation proposes that the term fly- refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness.[15] Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the \\"mad\\" or \\"fool's\\" version of the highly regarded edible mushroom Amanita caesarea. Hence there is oriol foll \\"mad oriol\\" in Catalan, mujolo folo from Toulouse, concourlo fouolo from the Aveyron department in Southern France, ovolo matto from Trentino in Italy. A local dialect name in Fribourg in Switzerland is tsapi de diablhou, which translates as \\"Devil's hat\\".[5]:194\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria is the type species of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of Amanita subgenus Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base.[16][17] Amanita section Amanita consists of A.?muscaria and its close relatives, including A.?pantherina (the panther cap), A.?gemmata, A.?farinosa, and A.?xanthocephala.[18] Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.[19][20]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within the species. In The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies, though without description: A.?muscaria ssp. muscaria, A.?muscaria ssp. americana, and A.?muscaria ssp. flavivolvata.[16]\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of A.?muscaria by mycologist J܇zsef Geml and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian \\"subalpine\\", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. alba, var. flavivolvata, var. formosa (including var. guessowii), and var. regalis from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are polymorphisms rather than distinct subspecies or varieties.[21] Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oakÿhickoryÿpine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species; thus A.?muscaria as it stands currently is evidently a species complex.[22] The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species:[1] A.?breckonii is a buff-capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest,[23] and the brown-capped A.?gioiosa and A.?heterochroma from the Mediterranean Basin and from Sardinia respectively. Both of these last two are found with Eucalyptus and Cistus trees, and it is unclear whether they are native or introduced from Australia.[24][25]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanitaceae.org now only recognize three varieties but says that they will be segregated into their own taxa in the near future, the varieties are:[26]\\r\\n\\r\\nA large, conspicuous mushroom, Amanita muscaria is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with basidiocarps in all stages of development.\\r\\nFly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the universal veil, a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil; this is helpful in identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from globose to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens.[28] Fully grown, the bright red cap is usually around 8ÿ20?cm (3ÿ8?in) in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe free gills are white, as is the spore print. The oval spores measure 9ÿ13 by 6.5ÿ9?m; they do not turn blue with the application of iodine.[29] The stipe is white, 5ÿ20?cm (2.0ÿ7.9?in) high by 1ÿ2?cm (0.5ÿ1?in) wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a bulb that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the partial veil (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white ring. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.[30][31]\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as Armillaria cf. mellea and the edible Amanita basiia Mexican species similar to A.?caesarea of Europe. Poison control centres in the U.S. and Canada have become aware that amarill (Spanish for 'yellow') is a common name for the A.?caesarea-like species in Mexico.[4] Amanita caesarea can be distinguished by its entirely orange to red cap which lacks the numerous white warty spots of the fly agaric. Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of A. caesarea are bright yellow, not white.[32] The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales.[33] In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette (Amanita xanthocephala), which grows in association with eucalypts. The latter species generally lacks the white warts of A.?muscaria and bears no ring.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria is a cosmopolitan mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the temperate and boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere,[21] including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as Hindu Kush, the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the SiberianÿBeringian region in the Tertiary period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America.[21] The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the Pacific coast. This species is often found in similar locations to Boletus edulis, and may appear in fairy rings.[35] Conveyed with pine seedlings, it has been widely transported into the southern hemisphere, including Australia,[36] New Zealand,[37] South Africa[38] and South America, where it can be found in the southern Brazilian states of Paran[21] and Rio Grande do Sul.[39]\\r\\n\\r\\nEctomycorrhizal, Amanita muscaria forms symbiotic relationships with many trees, including pine, spruce, fir, birch, and cedar. Commonly seen under introduced trees,[40] A.?muscaria is the fungal equivalent of a weed in New Zealand, Tasmania and Victoria, forming new associations with southern beech (Nothofagus).[41] The species is also invading a rainforest in Australia, where it may be displacing the native species.[40] It appears to be spreading northwards, with recent reports placing it near Port Macquarie on the New South Wales north coast.[42] It was recorded under silver birch (Betula pendula) in Manjimup, Western Australia in 2010.[43] Although it has apparently not spread to eucalypts in Australia, it has been recorded associating with them in Portugal.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience.[15][45][46] Occasionally it has been ingested in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs.[47] The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then may appear to be the edible A.?caesarea.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria contains several biologically active agents, at least one of which, muscimol, is known to be psychoactive. Ibotenic acid, a neurotoxin, serves as a prodrug to muscimol, with approximately 10ÿ20% converting to muscimol after ingestion. An active dose in adults is approximately 6?mg muscimol or 30 to 60?mg ibotenic acid;[49][50] this is typically about the amount found in one cap of Amanita muscaria.[51] The amount and ratio of chemical compounds per mushroom varies widely from region to region and season to season, which can further confuse the issue. Spring and summer mushrooms have been reported to contain up to 10 times more ibotenic acid and muscimol than autumn fruitings.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nA fatal dose has been calculated as 15 caps.[52] Deaths from this fungus A.?muscaria have been reported in historical journal articles and newspaper reports,[53][54][55] but with modern medical treatment, fatal poisoning from ingesting this mushroom is extremely rare.[56] Many older books list Amanita muscaria as \\"deadly\\", but this is an error that implies the mushroom is more toxic than it is.[57] The North American Mycological Association has stated that there were: \\"no reliably documented cases of death from toxins in these mushrooms in the past 100 years\\".[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe active constituents of this species are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.?muscaria.[59] Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol.[60] According to some sources, once detoxified, the mushroom becomes edible.[61][62]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuscarine, discovered in 1869,[63] was long thought to be the active hallucinogenic agent in A.?muscaria. Muscarine binds with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors leading to the excitation of neurons bearing these receptors. The levels of muscarine in Amanita muscaria are minute when compared with other poisonous fungi[64] such as Inocybe erubescens, the small white Clitocybe species C. dealbata and C. rivulosa. The level of muscarine in A.?muscaria is too low to play a role in the symptoms of poisoning.[65]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe major toxins involved in A.?muscaria poisoning are muscimol (3-hydroxy-5-aminomethyl-1-isoxazole, an unsaturated cyclic hydroxamic acid) and the related amino acid ibotenic acid. Muscimol is the product of the decarboxylation (usually by drying) of ibotenic acid. Muscimol and ibotenic acid were discovered in the mid-20th century.[66][67] Researchers in England,[68] Japan,[69] and Switzerland[67] showed that the effects produced were due mainly to ibotenic acid and muscimol, not muscarine.[13][66] These toxins are not distributed uniformly in the mushroom. Most are detected in the cap of the fruit, a moderate amount in the base, with the smallest amount in the stalk.[70][71] Quite rapidly, between 20 and 90 minutes after ingestion, a substantial fraction of ibotenic acid is excreted unmetabolised in the urine of the consumer. Almost no muscimol is excreted when pure ibotenic acid is eaten, but muscimol is detectable in the urine after eating A.?muscaria, which contains both ibotenic acid and muscimol.[50]\\r\\n\\r\\nIbotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major neurotransmitters of the central nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors[72] which are involved in the control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication.[15][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMuscazone is another compound that has more recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It is a product of the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation.[73] Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents.[15] Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate vanadium to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants.[74] Vanadium is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine.[74] The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.[75]\\r\\n\\r\\nFly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.[45][46][51][54]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium, somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning (such as that caused by Datura stramonium), characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression. Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings.[46][51] Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days.[48][50] In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24?hours.[59] The effect is highly variable between individuals, with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions.[45][50][76] Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards.[50] Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery.[51]\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion.[77] Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situation.[78]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended.[79] If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures.[45] Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol.[80] Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required.[51][81] Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation.[46][82] Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary.[59] With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.[56][59]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wide range of psychoactive effects have been variously described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and or deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur; the latter two effects may occur simultaneously and or alternatingly as part of Alice in Wonderland syndrome, collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions pelopsia and teleopsia. Some users report lucid dreaming under the influence of its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.?muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.?muscaria began increasing.[83]:17\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Marija Gimbutien?, a renowned Lithuanian historian, reported to R. Gordon Wasson on the use of this mushroom in Lithuania. In remote areas of Lithuania Amanita muscaria has been consumed at wedding feasts, in which mushrooms were mixed with vodka. The professor also reported that the Lithuanians used to export A.?muscaria to the Lapps in the Far North for use in shamanic rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in Eastern Europe.[84]:43ÿ44\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of A.?muscaria use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of A.?muscaria was not practised by these peoples.[85] In western Siberia, the use of A.?muscaria was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a trance state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, A.?muscaria was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously.[85] In eastern Siberia, the shaman would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine.[5]:161 This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the A.?muscaria mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Koryak of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (wapaq) which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity Vahiyinin (\\"Existence\\") spat onto earth, and his spittle became the wapaq, and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the wapaq, Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it.[87] Among the Koryaks, one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.[5]:234ÿ35\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Finnish historian T. I. Itkonen mentions that A.?muscaria was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots.[5]:279 In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan.[88] There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.?muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it was known as the miskwedo.[89][90] This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking.[91] There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of Amanita muscaria.[92]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notion that Vikings used A.?muscaria to produce their berserker rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel ?dmann in 1784.[93] ?dmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among Siberian shamans. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people.[94] It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be \\"very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright\\".[94]\\r\\n\\r\\nAmanita muscaria is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of ibotenic acid and muscimol.\\r\\nRecently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.[95]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1968, R. Gordon Wasson proposed that A.?muscaria was the Soma talked about in the Rig Veda of India,[5]:10 a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time.[96] He noted that descriptions of Soma omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom,[5]:18 and used the adjective hri \\"dazzling\\" or \\"flaming\\" which the author interprets as meaning red.[5]:36ÿ37 One line described men urinating Soma; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming \\"from the mountains\\", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan invaders from the north.[5]:22ÿ24 Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the Manusm?ti.[97]\\r\\nIn 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.[98] In his 1976 survey, Hallucinogens and Culture, anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.[99]\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilologist, archeologist, and Dead Sea Scrolls scholar John Marco Allegro postulated that early Christian theology was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the entheogenic consumption of A. muscaria in his 1970 book The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,[100] but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of ethnomycology. The book was roundly discredited by academics and theologians, including Sir Godfrey Driver, Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at Oxford University, and Henry Chadwick, the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford.[101] Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the Middle East, even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been \\"the best kept secret in the world\\" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.[102][103]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe toxins in A.?muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or finely diced and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked, it seems to be detoxified.[61] Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread,[104] the consumption of detoxified A.?muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Flix Archimde Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.?muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nUse of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of A.?muscaria by an African-American mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist Frederick Vernon Coville. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak.[105] It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.[106]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of A.?muscaria as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that Amanita muscaria be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of cultural bias, as several other popular edible species, notably morels, are toxic unless properly cooked.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mushroom has been widely consumed in Nagano, Japan,[107] and is mainly pickled for consumption there.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis mushroom also widely appears on the Central Coast of the United States in California and author Hank Shaw filled four grocery bags ' worth of them.[107]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red-and-white spotted toadstool is a common image in many aspects of popular culture.[29] Garden ornaments and children's picture books depicting gnomes and fairies, such as the Smurfs, often show fly agarics used as seats, or homes.[29][109] Fly agarics have been featured in paintings since the Renaissance,[110] albeit in a subtle manner. In the Victorian era they became more visible, becoming the main topic of some fairy paintings.[111] Two of the most famous uses of the mushroom are in the video game series Super Mario Bros. (specifically two of the power-up items and the platforms in several stages),[112] and the dancing mushroom sequence in the 1940 Disney film Fantasia.[113]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn account of the journeys of Philip von Strahlenberg to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the mukhomor there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith in his widely read 1762 novel, Citizen of the World.[116] The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time.[117] Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke in his books The Seven Sisters of Sleep and A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi.[118] This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[114] A hallucinogenic \\"scarlet toadstool\\" from Lappland is featured as a plot element in Charles Kingsley's 1866 novel Hereward the Wake based on the medieval figure of the same name.[119] Thomas Pynchon's 1973 novel Gravity's Rainbow describes the fungus as a \\"relative of the poisonous Destroying Angel\\" and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested Amanita muscaria.[120] Fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel Thursbitch by Alan Garner.[121]","input":"What is the red mushroom with white dots?"},{"output":"Folk Art Specialties","context":"Chico's is a retail women's clothing chain founded in 1983 by a three-person operation on Sanibel Island, Florida.

It derived most directly from the rhythm and blues music of the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier blues, boogie woogie, jazz and swing music, and was also influenced by gospel, country and western, and traditional folk music. Rock and roll in turn provided the main basis for the music that, since the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as rock music.\\r\\nThe phrase \\"rocking and rolling\\" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but it was used by the early 20th century, both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently ÿ but still intermittently ÿ in the late 1930s and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as \\"rhythm and blues\\" music aimed at black audiences. In 1951, Cleveland-based disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style while popularizing the term \\"rock and roll\\" to describe it.[1]\\r\\nVarious recordings that date back to the 1940s have been named as the first rock and roll record.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alliterative phrase \\"rocking and rolling\\" originally was used by mariners at least as early as the 17th century to describe the combined \\"rocking\\" (fore and aft) and \\"rolling\\" (side to side) motion of a ship on the ocean.[2] Examples include an 1821 reference, \\"...?prevent her from rocking and rolling?...\\",[3] and an 1835 reference to a ship \\"...?rocking and rolling on both beam-ends\\".[4] As the term referred to movement forwards, backwards and from side to side, it acquired sexual connotations from early on; the sea shanty \\"Johnny Bowker\\" (or \\"Boker\\"), probably from the early 19th century, contains the lines \\"Oh do, my Johnny Bowker/ Come rock and roll me over\\".[5][6]\\r\\nThe hymn \\"Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep\\", with words written in the 1830s by Emma Willard and tune by Joseph Philip Knight,[7][8] was recorded several times around the start of the 20th century by the Original Bison City Quartet before 1894,[9] the Standard Quartette in 1895,[10] John W. Myers at about the same time,[11] and Gus Reed in 1908.[12] By that time, the specific phrase \\"rocking and rolling\\" was also used by African Americans in spirituals with a religious connotation.[2] The earliest known recording of the phrase in use was on a 1904 Victor phonograph record \\"The Camp Meeting Jubilee\\" by the Haydn Quartet,[13] with the words \\"We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ In the arms of Moses.\\" Another version was issued on the Little Wonder record label in 1916. \\"Rocking\\" was also used to describe the spiritual rapture felt by worshippers at certain religious events, and to refer to the rhythm often found in the accompanying music.[2]\\r\\nAt the same time, the terminology was used in secular contexts, for example to describe the motion of railroad trains. It has been suggested that it also was used by men building railroads, who would sing to keep the pace, swinging their hammers down to drill a hole into the rock, and the men who held the steel spikes would \\"rock\\" the spike back and forth to clear rock or \\"roll\\", twisting it to improve the \\"bite\\" of the drill.[14] \\"Rocking\\" and \\"rolling\\" were also used, both separately and together, in a sexual context; writers for hundreds of years had used the phrases \\"They had a roll in the hay\\" or \\"I rolled her in the clover\\".[15]\\r\\nBy the early 20th century the words increasingly were used together in secular black slang with a double meaning, ostensibly referring to dancing and partying, but often with the subtextual meaning of sex.[16][17]\\r\\nIn 1922, blues singer Trixie Smith recorded \\"My Man Rocks Me (with One Steady Roll),\\" first featuring the two words in a secular context.[18] Although it was played with a backbeat and was one of the first \\"around the clock\\" lyrics, this slow minor-key blues was by no means \\"rock and roll\\" in the later sense.[19] However, the terms \\"rocking\\", and \\"rocking and rolling\\", were increasingly used through the 1920s and 1930s, especially but not exclusively by black secular musicians, to refer to either dancing or sex, or both. In 1927, blues singer Blind Blake used the couplet \\"Now we gonna do the old country rock / First thing we do, swing your partners\\" in \\"West Coast Blues\\", which in turn formed the basis of \\"Old Country Rock\\" by William Moore the following year.[20] Also in 1927, traditional country musician Uncle Dave Macon, with his group the Fruit Jar Drinkers, recorded \\"Sail Away Ladies\\" with a refrain of \\"Don't she rock, daddy-o\\", and \\"Rock About My Saro Jane\\".[21] Duke Ellington recorded \\"Rockin' in Rhythm\\" in 1928, and Robinson's Knights of Rest recorded \\"Rocking and Rolling\\" in 1930.[2]\\r\\nIn 1932, the phrase \\"rock and roll\\" was heard in the Hal Roach film Asleep in the Feet.[citation needed] In 1934, the Boswell Sisters had a pop hit with \\"Rock and Roll\\" from the film Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round,[22][23] where the term was used to describe the motion of a ship at sea.[24] In 1935, Henry \\"Red\\" Allen recorded \\"Get Rhythm in Your Feet and Music in Your Soul\\" which included the lyric \\"If Satan starts to hound you, commence to rock and roll / Get rhythm in your feet...\\" The lyrics were written by the prolific composer J. Russel Robinson with Bill Livingston. Allen's recording was a \\"race\\" record on the Vocalion label, but the tune was quickly covered by white musicians, notably Benny Goodman with singer Helen Ward.[citation needed]\\r\\nOther notable recordings using the words, both released in 1938, were \\"Rock It for Me\\" by Chick Webb, a swing number with Ella Fitzgerald on vocals featuring the lyrics \\"...?Won't you satisfy my soul, With the rock and roll?\\"; and \\"Rock Me\\" by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a gospel song originally written by Thomas Dorsey as \\"Hide Me in Thy Bosom\\". Tharpe performed the song in the style of a city blues, with secular lyrics, ecstatic vocals and electric guitar.[25] She changed Dorsey's \\"singing\\" to \\"swinging,\\" and the way she rolled the \\"R\\" in \\"rock me\\" led to the phrase being taken as a double entendre, with the interpretation as religious or sexual.[26]\\r\\nThe following year, Western swing musician Buddy Jones recorded \\"Rockin' Rollin' Mama\\", which drew on the term's original meaning ÿ \\"Waves on the ocean, waves in the sea/ But that gal of mine rolls just right for me/ Rockin' rollin' mama, I love the way you rock and roll\\". In August 1939, Irene Castle devised a new dance called \\"The Castle Rock and Roll\\", described as \\"an easy swing step\\", which she performed at the Dancing Masters of America convention at the Hotel Astor.[27] The Marx Brothers' 1941 film The Big Store featured actress Virginia O'Brien singing a song starting out as a traditional lullaby which soon changes into a rocking boogie-woogie with lines like \\"Rock, rock, rock it, baby?...\\"'. Although the song was only a short comedy number, it contains references which, by then, would have been understood by a wide general audience.\\r\\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, an early use of the word \\"rock\\" in describing a style of music was in a review in Metronome magazine on July 21, 1938, which stated that \\"Harry James' \\"Lullaby in Rhythm\\" really rocks.\\"[28] In 1939, a review of \\"Ciribiribin\\" and \\"Yodelin' Jive\\" by the Andrews Sisters with Bing Crosby, in the journal The Musician, stated that the songs \\"...?rock and roll with unleashed enthusiasm tempered to strict four-four time\\".[29]\\r\\nBy the early 1940s, the term \\"rock and roll\\" also was being used in record reviews by Billboard journalist and columnist Maurie Orodenker. In the May 30, 1942 issue, for instance, he described Sister Rosetta Tharpe's vocals on a re-recording of \\"Rock Me\\" with Lucky Millinder's band as \\"rock-and-roll spiritual singing\\",[30] and on October 3, 1942, he described Count Basie's \\"It's Sand, Man!\\" as \\"an instrumental screamer.. [which].. displays its rock and roll capacities when tackling the righteous rhythms.\\"[31] In the April 25, 1945 edition, Orodenker described Erskine Hawkins' version of \\"Caldonia\\" as \\"right rhythmic rock and roll music\\", a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of \\"Sugar Lump\\" by Joe Liggins.[32][33]\\r\\nA double, ironic, meaning came to popular awareness in 1947 in blues artist Roy Brown's song \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", covered in 1948 by Wynonie Harris in a wilder version, in which \\"rocking\\" was ostensibly about dancing but was in fact a thinly veiled allusion to sex. Such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves. After the success of \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", many other R&B artists used similar titles through the late 1940s. At least two different songs with the title \\"Rock and Roll\\" were recorded in the late 1940s: by Paul Bascomb in 1947 and Wild Bill Moore in 1948.[34] In May 1948, Savoy Records advertised \\"Robbie-Dobey Boogie\\" by Brownie McGhee with the tagline \\"It jumps, it's made, it rocks, it rolls.\\"[35] Another record where the phrase was repeated throughout the song was \\"Rock and Roll Blues\\", recorded in 1949 by Erline \\"Rock and Roll\\" Harris.[36]\\r\\nThese songs were generally classed as \\"race music\\" or, from the late 1940s, \\"rhythm and blues\\", and were barely known by mainstream white audiences.[37] However, in 1951, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began broadcasting rhythm, blues, and country music for a multi-racial audience. Freed, familiar with the music of earlier decades, used the phrase rock and roll to describe the music he aired over station WJW (850?AM); its use ialso is credited to Freed's sponsor, record store owner Leo Mintz, who encouraged Freed to play the music on the radio.[1][38] Originally Freed used the name \\"Moondog\\" for himself and any concerts or promotions he put on because he used as his regular theme music a piece called \\"Moondog Symphony\\" by the street musician Louis \\"Moondog\\" Hardin. Hardin subsequently sued Freed on grounds that he was stealing his name, and because Freed was no longer allowed to use the term Moondog, he needed a new catchphrase. After a night of heavy drinking, he and his friends came up with the name The Rock and Roll Party because he already was using the phrase Rock and Roll Session to describe the music he was playing.[citation needed] As his show became extremely popular, the term became widely used to describe the style of music.\\r\\nRock and roll music emerged from the wide variety of musical genres that existed in the United States in the first half of the 20th century among different ethnic and social groups. Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. The greatest contribution came from the musical traditions of America's black population, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of \\"blue notes\\" and often using a \\"call and response\\" vocal pattern. African music was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk ballad, and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of blues, ragtime, jazz, and gospel music.[16][39] According to the writer Robert Palmer:\\r\\n\\"Rock 'n' roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle. Bedrock black church music influenced blues, rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the Northern ghettos, blues and black pop influenced jazz, and so on. But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white.\\"[40]\\r\\nBy the 1930s, African American musicians, such as Cab Calloway, Fletcher Henderson and Duke Ellington, were developing swing music, essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as Count Basie's, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as the Harlem Hamfats, and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as Jimmie Rodgers incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, Western swing bands, such as Bob Wills, combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other's music, so styles merged and innovations spread.[40] Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, 78?rpm and later records and jukeboxes, and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new amplification and electronic recording techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the electric guitar, first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by Charlie Christian.[16]\\r\\nIn 1938, promoter and record producer John H. Hammond staged the first \\"From Spirituals to Swing\\" concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist Pete Johnson and singer Big Joe Turner, whose recording of \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" helped spark a craze across American society for \\"boogie woogie\\" music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier big bands unwieldy; Louis Jordan left Chick Webb's orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring \\"honking\\" saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This \\"jump blues\\" encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by Lionel Hampton.\\r\\nIncreasingly, the term \\"rocking\\" was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as Wynonie Harris whose records reached the top of the newly christened \\"rhythm and blues\\" charts.[16][40]\\r\\nIn 1947, blues singer Roy Brown recorded \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word \\"rocking\\" and the gospel call \\"Have you heard the news?\\", relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about \\"rocking\\", including \\"We're Gonna Rock\\" by Wild Bill Moore, the first commercially successful \\"honking\\" sax record, with the words \\"We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll\\" as a background chant. One of the most popular was \\"Rock the Joint\\", first recorded by Jimmy Preston in May 1949, and a R&B top 10 hit that year. Preston's version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen. Marshall Lytle, Haley's bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired Alan Freed to coin the phrase \\"rock and roll\\" to refer to the music he played.[2]\\r\\nFreed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase \\"rock and roll\\" was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community's need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as \\"rocking\\" rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential \\"Rocket 88\\" recorded by Ike Turner and his band but credited to singer Jackie Brenston, the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as \\"doo-wop\\", such as \\"Gee\\" by the Crows and \\"Earth Angel\\" by the Penguins, became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included Modern, Imperial, Specialty, Atlantic, King and Chess.\\r\\nThe adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As Billy Burnette said about his father Dorsey Burnette and uncle Johnny Burnette:\\r\\nThey'd buy their clothes on Beale Street, at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin' it, they were just about the first.[41]\\r\\nAlthough some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years ÿ such as Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, and Fats Domino who had his first R&B hit in 1950 ÿ made the transition into new markets, much of the initial breakthrough into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as double tracking, developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in jukeboxes. At the same time, younger black musicians such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era. By the time of Haley's first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, rock and roll was firmly established.[2][16] The Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.[42]\\r\\nThe identity of the first rock and roll record is one of the most enduring subjects of debate among rock historians.[93] Various recordings dating back to the 1940s and 1950s have been cited as the first rock and roll record.[94] A number of sources have considered the first to be \\"Rocket 88\\", which was recorded in 1951 by Ike Turner and his band, but credited to his saxophonist and the song's vocalist Jackie Brenston.[95] According to The Boston Globe's Joan Anderman, most rock historians cite it as the first,[96] while The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll and the website of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said that it is \\"frequently cited\\" and \\"widely considered the first\\", respectively.[95] People in the music industry have also called it the first, among several others.[97] \\"Rocket 88\\" is cited for its forceful backbeat and unrefined, distorted electric guitar.[98] By contrast, writer and musician Michael Campbell wrote that, \\"from our perspective,\\" it was not the first rock and roll record because it had a shuffle beat rather than the rock rhythm originally characteristic in Chuck Berry's and Little Richard's songs, although he added that \\"Rocket 88\\" had basic characteristics of rock music such as the emphasis on guitar and distortion.[99] Its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated. Nigel Williamson questions whether it was really an R&B song \\"with an unusually fast, bottom-heavy eight-to-the bar boogie rhythm and a great lyric about cars, booze and women\\".[100]\\r\\nThe music historian Robert Palmer wrote that Goree Carter's earlier 1949 song \\"Rock Awhile\\" is a \\"much more appropriate candidate\\" than \\"the more frequently cited\\" \\"Rocket 88\\", primarily because of the presence of loud electric guitar work on the former song.[77] Palmer wrote that \\"Rocket 88\\" is credited for its raucous saxophone, boogie-woogie beat, fuzzy amplified guitar, and lyrics that celebrate the automobile.[101] However, he regards \\"Rock Awhile\\" to be a more appropriate candidate for the \\"first rock and roll record\\" title, because it was recorded two years earlier, and because of Carter's guitar work bearing a striking resemblance to Chuck Berry's later guitar work, while making use of an over-driven amplifier, along with the backing of boogie-based rhythms, and the appropriate title and lyrical subject matter.[77] Roger Wood and John Nova Lomax also have cited \\"Rock Awhile\\" as the first rock & roll record.[102][103] Others have taken the view that the first was Roy Brown's \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\", or Wynonie Harris' 1948 version; the song received greater exposure when Elvis Presley covered it in 1954.[104] Sister Rosetta Tharpe's 1944 song \\"Strange Things Happening Every Day\\" has also been viewed as among the first.[69]\\r\\nMost rock historians have cited Bill Haley's 1953 song \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\" as the first rock and roll record to reach the Billboard charts.[105] Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" released in 1954 was the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre.[94] Along with \\"Rock Around the Clock\\", several rock critics also have pointed to Presley's \\"That's All Right\\" from 1954 as a candidate for the first rock and roll record.[106]\\r\\nThe 1992 book What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record? by Jim Dawson and Steve Propes[49] discusses 50 contenders, from Illinois Jacquet's \\"Blues, Part 2\\" (1944) to Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" (1956), without reaching a definitive conclusion. In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock 'n' roll was set by disc jockey Alan Freed's use of the term in his groundbreaking The Rock and Roll Show on New York's WINS in late 1954, as well as at his Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&B style (Bill Haley, Elvis Presley). The artists who appeared at Freed's earliest shows included orchestra leader Buddy Johnson, the Clovers, Fats Domino, Big Joe Turner, the Moonglows, Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters, and the Harptones. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by Illinois Jacquet with Jazz at the Philharmonic in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, \\"Blues, Part 2,\\" was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on \\"Blues\\", including Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine (the monikers employed by Les Paul and Nat \\"King\\" Cole, respectively, in order to appear at the JATP concert incognito).\\r\\nIn 2004, Elvis Presley's \\"That's All Right Mama\\" and Bill Haley's \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" both celebrated their 50th anniversaries. Rolling Stone felt that Presley's song was the first rock and roll recording.[107] At the time, Presley recorded Big Joe Turner's \\"Shake, Rattle & Roll\\", later covered by Haley, was already at the top of the Billboard R&B charts.[108] The Guardian felt that while there were rock and roll records before Presley's, his recording was the moment when all the strands came together in \\"perfect embodiment\\".[109] Presley is quoted as saying: \\"A lot of people seem to think I started this business, but rock and roll was here a long time before I came along.\\"[110]\\r\\nAlso formative in the sound of rock and roll were Little Richard and Chuck Berry.[111] From the early 1950s,[112] Little Richard combined gospel with New Orleans R&B, heavy backbeat,[113] pounding piano and wailing vocals.[114] Ray Charles referred to Little Richard as being the artist that started a new kind of music, which was a funky style of rock and roll that he was performing onstage for a few years before appearing on record in 1955 as \\"Tutti Frutti.\\"[115][116][117] Chuck Berry, with \\"Maybellene\\" (recorded on May 21, 1955, and which reached # 1 on the R&B chart and no. 5 on the US pop chart), \\"Roll over Beethoven\\" (1956), \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" (1957) and \\"Johnny B. Goode\\" (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing guitar intros and lead breaks that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music.[117] Early rock and roll used the twelve-bar blues chord progression and shared with boogie woogie the four beats (usually broken down into eight eighth-notes/quavers) to a bar. Rock and roll however has a greater emphasis on the backbeat than boogie woogie.[118] Bo Diddley's 1955 hit \\"Bo Diddley\\", with its B-side \\"I'm a Man\\", introduced a new beat and unique guitar style that inspired many artists without either side using the 12-bar pattern ÿ they instead played variations on a single chord each.[119] His more insistent, driving rhythms, hard-edged electric guitar sound, African rhythms, and signature clave beat (a simple, five-accent rhythm), have remained cornerstones of rock and pop.[120][121][122]\\r\\nOthers point out that performers like Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino were recording blues songs as early as 1946 that are indistinguishable from later rock and roll, and that these blues songs were based on themes, chord changes, and rhythms dating back decades before that.[95][not in citation given] Wynonie Harris' 1947 cover of Roy Brown's \\"Good Rocking Tonight\\" is also a claimant for the title of first rock and roll record, as the popularity of this record led to many answer songs, mostly by black artists, with the same rocking beat, during the late 1940s and early 1950s.[2] Big Joe Turner's 1939 recording \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" is close to 1950s rock and roll.[123] Sister Rosetta Tharpe also was recording shouting, stomping music in the 1930s and 1940s, such as \\"Strange Things Happening Every Day\\" (1944), that in some ways contained major elements of mid-1950s rock and roll.[69] Pushing the date back even earlier, blues researcher Gayle Dean Wardlow has stated that \\"Crazy About My Baby\\" by Blind Roosevelt Graves and his brother, recorded in 1929, \\"could be considered the first rock 'n' roll recording\\".[50]\\r\\nBy contrast, musician and writer Billy Vera argued that because rock and roll was \\"an evolutionary process\\", it would be foolish to name any single record as the first.[124] Writer Nick Tosches similarly felt that, \\"It is impossible to discern the first modern rock record, just as it is impossible to discern where blue becomes indigo in the spectrum.\\"[5] Music writer Rob Bowman remarked that the long-debated question is useless and cannot be answered because \\"criteria vary depending upon who is making the selection.\\"[125]","input":"When was the first rock and roll song made?"},{"output":"Botulinum","context":"Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species.[1] It prevents the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes flaccid paralysis. Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics and research.\\r\\nBotulinum is the most acutely lethal toxin known, with an estimated human median lethal dose (LD50) of 1.3ÿ2.1 ng/kg intravenously or intramuscularly and 10ÿ13?ng/kg when inhaled.[2]\\r\\nThere are eight types of botulinum toxin, named type AÿH. Type A and B are capable of causing disease in humans, and are also used commercially and medically.[3] Types CÿG are less common; types E and F can cause disease in humans, while the other types cause disease in other animals.[4] Type H is considered the deadliest substance in the world?ÿ  an injection of only 2-billionths of a gram (2 ng) can cause death to an adult.[5] Botulinum toxin types A and B are used in medicine to treat various muscle spasms and diseases characterized by overactive muscle. The commercial form is marketed under the brand name Botox, among others.[6][7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBotulinum toxin is used to treat a number of problems.\\r\\nBotulinum toxin is used to treat a number of disorders characterized by overactive muscle movement, including post-stroke spasticity, post-spinal cord injury spasticity, spasms of the head and neck,[8] eyelid,[9] vagina,[10] limbs, jaw, and vocal cords.[11] Similarly, botulinum toxin is used to relax clenching of muscles, including those of the oesophagus,[12] jaw,[13] lower urinary tract and bladder,[14] or clenching of the anus which can exacerbate anal fissure.[15] It may also be used for improper eye alignment.[16] Botulinum toxin appears to be effective for refractory overactive bladder.[17]\\r\\nStrabismus is caused by imbalances in the actions of muscles that rotate the eyes, and can sometimes be relieved by weakening a muscle that pulls too strongly, or pulls against one that has been weakened by disease or trauma. Muscles weakened by toxin injection recover from paralysis after several months, so it might seem that injection would then need to be repeated. However, muscles adapt to the lengths at which they are chronically held,[18] so that if a paralyzed muscle is stretched by its antagonist, it grows longer, while the antagonist shortens, yielding a permanent effect. If there is good binocular vision, the brain mechanism of motor fusion, which aligns the eyes on a target visible to both, can stabilize the corrected alignment.\\r\\nIn January 2014, botulinum toxin was approved by UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for treatment of restricted ankle motion due to lower limb spasticity associated with stroke in adults.[19]\\r\\nOn July 29, 2016, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), of the United States of America approved abobotulinumtoxinA for injection for the treatment of lower limb spasticity in pediatric patients two years of age and older.[20] AbobotulinumtoxinA is the first and only FDA-approved botulinum toxin for the treatment of pediatric lower limb spasticity. In the United States of America, the FDA approves the text of the labels of prescription medicines. The FDA approves which medical conditions the drug manufacturer may sell the drug for. However, those approved by the FDA to prescribe these drugs may freely prescribe them for any condition they wish, called off-label use. Botulinum toxins have been used off-label for several pediatric conditions, including infantile esotropia.[21]\\r\\nIn 2010, the FDA approved intramuscular botulinum toxin injections for prophylactic treatment of chronic migraine headache.[22]\\r\\nIn cosmetic applications, botulinum toxin is considered safe and effective for reduction of facial wrinkles, especially in the uppermost third of the face.[23] Injection of botulinum toxin into the muscles under facial wrinkles causes relaxation of those muscles, resulting in the smoothing of the overlying skin.[23] Smoothing of wrinkles is usually visible three days after treatment and is maximally visible two weeks following injection.[23] The treated muscles gradually regain function, and generally return to their former appearance three to four months after treatment.[23] Muscles can be treated repeatedly to maintain the smoothed appearance.[23]\\r\\nBotulinum toxin is also used to treat disorders of hyperactive nerves including excessive sweating,[24] neuropathic pain,[25] and some allergy symptoms.[11] In addition to these uses, botulinum toxin is being evaluated for use in treating chronic pain.[26]\\r\\nWhile botulinum toxin is generally considered safe in a clinical setting, there can be serious side effects from its use. Most commonly, botulinum toxin can be injected into the wrong muscle group or spread from the injection site, causing paralysis of unintended muscles.\\r\\nSide effects from cosmetic use generally result from unintended paralysis of facial muscles. These include partial facial paralysis, muscle weakness, and trouble swallowing. Side effects are not limited to direct paralysis however, and can also include headaches, flu-like syndromes, and allergic reactions.[27] Just as cosmetic treatments only last a number of months, paralysis side-effects can have the same durations.[citation needed] At least in some cases, these effects are reported to dissipate in the weeks after treatment.[citation needed] Bruising at the site of injection is not a side effect of the toxin but rather of the mode of administration, and is reported as preventable if the clinician applies pressure to the injection site; when it occurs, it is reported in specific cases to last 7ÿ11 days.[citation needed] When injecting the masseter muscle of the jaw, loss of muscle function can result in a loss or reduction of power to chew solid foods.[27]\\r\\nSide effects from therapeutic use can be much more varied depending on the location of injection and the dose of toxin injected. In general, side effects from therapeutic use can be more serious than those that arise during cosmetic use. These can arise from paralysis of critical muscle groups and can include arrhythmia, heart attack, and in some cases seizures, respiratory arrest, and death.[27] Additionally, side effects which are common in cosmetic use are also common in therapeutic use, including trouble swallowing, muscle weakness, allergic reactions, and flu-like syndromes.[27]\\r\\nIn response to the occurrence of these side effects, in 2008 the U.S. FDA notified the public of the potential dangers of botulinum toxin as a therapeutic. Namely, they warned that the toxin can spread to areas distant from the site of injection and paralyze unintended muscle groups, especially when used for treating muscle spasticity in children treated for cerebral palsy.[28] In 2009, the FDA announced that boxed warnings would be added to available botulinum toxin products, warning of their ability to spread from the injection site.[29] Additionally, the FDA announced name changes to several botulinum toxin products, meant to emphasize that the products are not interchangeable and require different doses for proper use. Botox and Botox Cosmetic were renamed onabotulinumtoxinA, Myobloc was renamed rimabotulinumtoxinB, and Dysport name renamed abobotulinumtoxinA.[29] In conjunction with this, the FDA issued a communication to health care professionals reiterating the new drug names and the approved uses for each.[30] A similar warning was issued by Health Canada in 2009, warning that botulinum toxin products can spread to other parts of the body.[31]\\r\\nBotulinum toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum is the cause of botulism.[9] Humans most commonly ingest the toxin from eating improperly-canned foods in which C. botulinum has grown. However, the toxin can also be introduced through an infected wound. In infants, the bacteria can sometimes grow in the intestines and produce botulinum toxin within the intestine and can cause a condition known as floppy baby syndrome.[32] In all cases, the toxin can then spread, blocking nerves and muscle function. In severe cases, the toxin can block nerves controlling the respiratory system or heart, resulting in death.[1] Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as it may appear similar to diseases such as GuillainÿBarr syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and stroke. Other tests, such as brain scan and spinal fluid examination, may help to rule out other causes. If the symptoms of botulism are diagnosed early, various treatments can be administered. In an effort to remove contaminated food which remains in the gut, enemas or induced vomiting may be used.[33] For wound infections, infected material may be removed surgically.[33] Botulinum antitoxin is available and may be used to prevent the worsening of symptoms, though it will not reverse existing nerve damage. In severe cases, mechanical respiration may be used to support patients suffering from respiratory failure.[33] The nerve damage heals over time, generally over weeks to months.[4] With proper treatment, the case fatality rate for botulinum poisoning can be greatly reduced.[33]\\r\\nTwo preparations of botulinum antitoxins are available for treatment of botulism. Trivalent (A,B,E) botulinum antitoxin is derived from equine sources using whole antibodies. The second antitoxin is Heptavalent (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) botulinum antitoxin, which is derived from equine antibodies which have been altered to make them less immunogenic. This antitoxin is effective against all known strains of botulism.\\r\\nBotulinum toxin exerts its effect by cleaving key proteins required for nerve activation. First, the toxin binds specifically to nerves which use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Once bound to the nerve terminal, the neuron takes up the toxin into a vesicle. As the vesicle moves farther into the cell, it acidifies, activating a portion of the toxin which triggers it to push across the vesicle membrane and into the cell cytoplasm.[1] Once inside the cytoplasm, the toxin cleaves SNARE proteins preventing the cell from releasing vesicles of neurotransmitter. This stops nerve signaling, leading to paralysis.[1]\\r\\nThe toxin itself is released from the bacterium as a single chain, then becomes activated when cleaved by its own proteases.[11] The active form consists of a two-chain protein composed of a 100-kDa heavy chain polypeptide joined via disulfide bond to a 50-kDa light chain polypeptide.[35] The heavy chain contains domains with several functions: it has the domain responsible for binding specifically to presynaptic nerve terminals, as well as the domain responsible for mediating translocation of the light chain into the cell cytoplasm as the vacuole acidifies.[1][35] The light chain is a zinc metalloprotease and is the active part of the toxin. It is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm where it cleaves the host protein SNAP-25, a member of the SNARE protein family which is responsible for fusion. The cleaved SNAP-25 is unable to mediate fusion of vesicles with the host cell membrane, thus preventing the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings.[1] This blockage is slowly reversed as the toxin loses activity and the SNARE proteins are slowly regenerated by the affected cell.[1]\\r\\nThe seven toxin types (A-G) have different tertiary structures and sequence differences.[35][36] While the different toxin types all target members of the SNARE family, different toxin types target different SNARE family members.[34] The A, B, and E serotypes cause human botulism, with the activities of types A and B enduring longest in vivo (from several weeks to months).[35]\\r\\nIn 1820, Justinus Kerner, a small-town German medical officer and romantic poet, gave the first complete description of clinical botulism based on extensive clinical observations of so-called sausage poisoning.[37] Following experiments on animals and on himself, he concluded that the toxin acts by interrupting signal transmission in the somatic and autonomic motor systems, without affecting sensory signals or mental functions. He observed that the toxin develops under anaerobic conditions, and can be lethal in minute doses.[38] His prescience in suggesting that the toxin might be used therapeutically earned him recognition as the pioneer of modern botulinum toxin therapy.[39]\\r\\nIn 1895 (seventy-five years later), mile van Ermengem, professor of bacteriology and a student of Robert Koch, correctly described Clostridium botulinum as the bacterial source of the toxin. Thirty-four attendees at a funeral were poisoned by eating partially salted ham, an extract of which was found to cause botulism-like paralysis in laboratory animals. Van Ermengem isolated and grew the bacterium, and described its toxin,[40] which was later purified by P Tessmer Snipe and Hermann Sommer.[41]\\r\\nOver the next three decades, 1895-1925, as food canning was approaching a billion-dollar-a-year industry, botulism was becoming a public health hazard. Karl Friedrich Meyer, a prodigiously productive Swiss-American veterinary scientist created a center at the Hooper Foundation in San Francisco, where he developed techniques for growing the organism and extracting the toxin, and conversely, for preventing organism growth and toxin production, and inactivating the toxin by heating. The California canning industry was thereby preserved.\\r\\nWith the outbreak of World War II, weaponization of botulinum toxin was investigated at Fort Detrick in Maryland. Carl Lamanna and James Duff[42] developed the concentration and crystallization techniques that Edward J. Schantz used to create the first clinical product. When the Armys Chemical Corps was disbanded, Schantz moved to the Food Research Institute in Wisconsin, where he manufactured toxin for experimental use and generously provided it to the academic community.\\r\\nThe mechanism of botulinum toxin action ÿ blocking the release from nerve endings of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ÿ was elucidated in the mid-1900s,[43] and remains an important research topic. Nearly all toxin treatments are based on this effect in various body tissues.\\r\\nOphthalmologists specializing in eye muscle disorders (strabismus) had developed the method of EMG-guided injection (using the electromyogram, the electrical signal from an activated muscle, to guide injection) of local anesthetics as a diagnostic technique for evaluating an individual muscles contribution to an eye movement.[44] Because strabismus surgery frequently needed repeating, a search was undertaken for non-surgical, injection treatments using various anesthetics, alcohols, enzymes, enzyme blockers, and snake neurotoxins. Finally, inspired by Daniel Drachmans work with chicks at Johns Hopkins,[45] Alan B Scott and colleagues injected botulinum toxin into monkey extraocular muscles.[46] The result was remarkable: a few picograms induced paralysis that was confined to the target muscle, long in duration, and without side-effects.\\r\\nAfter working out techniques for freeze-drying, buffering with albumin, and assuring sterility, potency, and safety, Scott applied to the FDA for investigational drug use, and began manufacturing botulinum type A neurotoxin in his San Francisco lab. He injected the first strabismus patients in 1977, reported its clinical utility in 1980,[47] and had soon trained hundreds of ophthalmologists in EMG-guided injection of the drug he named Oculinum (\\"eye aligner\\").\\r\\nIn 1986, Oculinum Inc, Scott's micromanufacturer and distributor of botulinum toxin, was unable to obtain product liability insurance, and could no longer supply the drug. As supplies became exhausted, patients who had come to rely on periodic injections became desperate. For 4 months, as liability issues were resolved, American blepharospasm patients traveled to Canadian eye centers for their injections.[48]\\r\\nBased on data from thousands of patients collected by 240 investigators, Allergan got FDA approval in 1989 to market Oculinum for clinical use in the United States to treat adult strabismus and blepharospasm, using the trademark Botox.[49] This was under the 1983 US Orphan Drug Act.[50]\\r\\nRichard Clark, a plastic surgeon from Sacramento (CA), was the first to document a cosmetic use for botulinum toxin.[51] He treated forehead asymmetry caused by left sided forehead nerve paralysis that occurred during a cosmetic facelift. Since the injured nerve could possibly regenerate by 24 months, a two-year waiting period was necessary before definitive surgical treatment could be done. Clark realized that botulinum toxin, which had been previously used only for cross eyed babies and facial tics, could also be injected to smooth the wrinkles of the right forehead to match her paralyzed left. He received FDA approval for this cosmetic application of the toxin and successfully treated the person and published the case study in 1989.[51]\\r\\nMarrying ophthalmology to dermatology, Jean and Alistair Carruthers observed that blepharospasm patients who received injections around the eyes and upper face also enjoyed diminished facial glabellar lines (frown lines between the eyebrows), thereby initiating the highly-popular cosmetic use of the toxin.[52] Brin, and a group at Columbia University under Monte Keen made similar reports.[53] In 2002, following clinical trials, the FDA approved Botox Cosmetic, botulinum A toxin to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines.[54] The FDA approved a fully in vitro assay for use in the stability and potency testing of Botox in response to increasing public concern that LD50 testing was required for each batch sold in the market.[55][56]\\r\\nWilliam J. Binder reported in 2000 that patients who had cosmetic injections around the face reported relief from chronic headache.[57] This was initially thought to be an indirect effect of reduced muscle tension, but it is now known that the toxin inhibits release of peripheral nociceptive neurotransmitters, suppressing the central pain processing systems responsible for migraine headache.[58][59]\\r\\nAs of 2013, botulinum toxin injections are the most common cosmetic operation, with 6.3 million procedures in the United States, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Qualifications for Botox injectors vary by county, state and country. Botox cosmetic providers include dermatologists, plastic surgeons, aesthetic spa physicians, dentists, nurse practitioners, nurses and physician assistants.\\r\\nThe global market for botulinum toxin products, driven by their cosmetic applications, is forecast to reach $2.9 billion by 2018. The facial aesthetics market, of which they are a component, is forecast to reach $4.7 billion ($2 billion in the U.S.) in the same timeframe.[60]\\r\\nBotulinum toxin has been recognized as a potential agent for use in bioterrorism.[61] It can be absorbed through the eyes, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, or non-intact skin.[62]\\r\\nThe effects of botulinum toxin are different from those of nerve agents involved insofar in that botulism symptoms develop relatively slowly (over several days), while nerve agent effects are generally much more rapid and can be instantaneous.[citation needed] Evidence suggests that nerve exposure (simulated by injection of atropine and pralidoxime) will increase mortality by enhancing botulinum toxin's mechanism of toxicity.[citation needed]\\r\\nWith regard to detection, current protocols using NBC detection equipment (such as M-8 paper or the ICAM) will not indicate a \\"positive\\" when samples containing botulinum toxin are tested.[citation needed] To confirm a diagnosis of botulinum toxin poisoning, therapeutically or to provide evidence in death investigations, botulinum toxin may be quantitated by immunoassay of human biological fluids; serum levels of 12ÿ24 mouse LD50 units per milliliter have been detected in poisoned patients.[63]\\r\\nThe Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo produced botulinum toxin and spread it as an aerosol in downtown Tokyo during the 1990s, but the attacks caused no fatalities.[64]\\r\\nIn addition, the German terrorist group known as the Red Army Faction produced a large quantity of botulinum toxin, but it was never used in an attack.[64]\\r\\nBotulinum toxin A is marketed under the brand names Botox, Dysport, and Xeomin. Botulinum toxin B is marketed under the brand name Myobloc.\\r\\nIn the United States, botulinum toxin products are manufactured by a variety of companies, for both therapeutic and cosmetic use. A U.S. supplier reported in its company materials in 2011 that it could \\"supply the world's requirements for 25 indications approved by Government agencies around the world\\" with less than one gram of raw botulinum toxin.[65] Myobloc or Neurobloc, a botulinum toxin type B product, is produced by Solstice Neurosciences, a subsidiary of US WorldMeds. AbobotulinumtoxinA), a therapeutic formulation of the type A toxin manufactured by Galderma in the United Kingdom, is licensed for the treatment of focal dystonias and certain cosmetic uses in the U.S. and other countries.[30]\\r\\nBesides the three primary U.S. manufacturers, there are numerous other botulinum toxin producers. Xeomin, manufactured in Germany by Merz, is also available for both therapeutic and cosmetic use in the U.S.[66] Lanzhou Institute of Biological Products in China manufactures a BTX-A product; as of 2014 it was the only BTX-A approved in China.[66] BTX-A is also sold as Lantox and Prosigne on the global market.[67] Neuronox, a BTX-A product, was introduced by Medy-Tox Inc. of South Korea in 2009;[68]\\r\\nBotulism toxins are produced by bacteria of the genus Clostridium, namely Clostridium botulinum, C. butyricum, C. baratii and C. argentinense,[69] which are widely distributed, including in soil and dust. As well, the bacteria can be found inside homes on floors, carpet, and countertops even after cleaning.[citation needed] Some food products such as honey can contain amounts of the bacteria.[citation needed]\\r\\nFood-borne botulism results, indirectly, from ingestion of food contaminated with Clostridium spores, where exposure to an anaerobic environment allows the spores to germinate, after which the bacteria can multiply and produce toxin.[citation needed] Critically, it is ingestion of toxin rather than spores or vegetative bacteria that causes botulism.[citation needed] Botulism is nevertheless known to be transmitted through canned foods not cooked correctly before canning or after can opening, and so is preventable.[citation needed] Infant botulism cases arise chiefly as a result of environmental exposure and are therefore more difficult to prevent.[citation needed] Infant botulism arising from consumption of honey can be prevented by eliminating honey from diets of children less than 12 months old.[70]\\r\\nTherapeutic and weaponisable forms of the toxin are sourced from strains of Clostriudium where both the growth and toxin isolation are under specialized conditions.[citation needed]\\r\\nProper refrigeration at temperatures below 3?C (38?F) retards the growth of Clostridium botulinum. The organism is also susceptible to high salt, high oxygen, and low pH levels.[citation needed] The toxin itself is rapidly destroyed by heat, such as in thorough cooking.[71] The spores that produce the toxin are heat-tolerant and will survive boiling water for an extended period of time.[72]\\r\\nThe botulinum toxin is denatured and thus deactivated at temperatures greater than 80?C (176?F).[73] As a zinc metalloprotease (see below), the toxin's activity is also susceptible, post-exposure, to inhibition by protease inhibitors, e.g., zinc-coordinating hydroxamates.[35][74]\\r\\nIn the early 1980s, university-based ophthalmologists in the USA and Canada further refined the use of botulinum toxin as a therapeutic agent. By 1985, a scientific protocol of injection sites and dosage had been empirically determined for treatment of blepharospasm and strabismus.[75] Side effects in treatment of this condition were deemed to be rare, mild and treatable.[76] The beneficial effects of the injection lasted only 4ÿ6 months. Thus, blepharospasm patients required re-injection two or three times a year.\\r\\nIn 1986, Scott's micromanufacturer and distributor of Botox was no longer able to supply the drug because of an inability to obtain product liability insurance. Patients became desperate, as supplies of Botox were gradually consumed, forcing him to abandon patients who would have been due for their next injection. For a period of four months, American blepharospasm patients had to arrange to have their injections performed by participating doctors at Canadian eye centers until the liability issues could be resolved.[48]\\r\\nIn December 1989, Botox was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of strabismus, blepharospasm, and hemifacial spasm in patients over 12 years old.[49]\\r\\nBotox has not been approved for any pediatric use.[30] It has, however, been used off-label by physicians for several conditions. including spastic conditions in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy, a therapeutic course that has resulted in patient deaths.[30] In the case of treatment of infantile esotropia in patients younger than 12 years of age, several studies have yielded differing results.[21][better?source?needed]\\r\\nThe cosmetic effect of BTX-A on wrinkles was originally documented by a plastic surgeon from Sacramento, California, Richard Clark, and published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in 1989.[51] Canadian husband and wife ophthalmologist and dermatologist physicians, JD and JA Carruthers, were the first to publish a study on BTX-A for the treatment of glabellar frown lines in 1992.[52] Similar effects had reportedly been observed by a number of independent groups (Brin, and the Columbia University group under Monte Keen.[53]) After formal trials, on April 12, 2002, the FDA announced regulatory approval of botulinum toxin type A (Botox Cosmetic) to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate-to-severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines).[54] Subsequently, cosmetic use of botulinum toxin type A has become widespread.[77] The results of Botox Cosmetic can last up to four months and may vary with each patient.[78] The US Food and Drug Administration approved an alternative product-safety testing method in response to increasing public concern that LD50 testing was required for each batch sold in the market.[55][56]\\r\\nBTX-A is now a common treatment for muscles affected by the upper motor neuron syndrome (UMNS), such as cerebral palsy, for muscles with an impaired ability to effectively lengthen. Muscles affected by UMNS frequently are limited by weakness, loss of reciprocal inhibition, decreased movement control and hypertonicity (including spasticity). In January 2014, Botulinum toxin was approved by UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for the treatment of ankle disability due to lower limb spasticity associated with stroke in adults.[19] Joint motion may be restricted by severe muscle imbalance related to the syndrome, when some muscles are markedly hypertonic, and lack effective active lengthening. Injecting an overactive muscle to decrease its level of contraction can allow improved reciprocal motion, so improved ability to move and exercise.\\r\\nKhalaf Bushara and David Park were the first to demonstrate a nonmuscular use of BTX-A while treating patients with hemifacial spasm in England in 1993, showing that botulinum toxin injections inhibit sweating, and so are useful in treating hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating).[79] BTX-A has since been approved for the treatment of severe primary axillary hyperhidrosis (excessive underarm sweating of unknown cause), which cannot be managed by topical agents.[11][24]\\r\\nBTX-A is commonly used to treat cervical dystonia, but it can become ineffective after a time. Botulinum toxin type B (BTX-B) received FDA approval for treatment of cervical dystonia on December 21, 2000. Trade names for BTX-B are Myobloc in the United States, and Neurobloc in the European Union.[66]\\r\\nOnabotulinumtoxin A (trade name Botox) received FDA approval for treatment of chronic migraines on October 15, 2010. The toxin is injected into the head and neck to treat these chronic headaches. Approval followed evidence presented to the agency from two studies funded by Allergan, Inc. showing a very slight improvement in incidence of chronic migraines for migraine sufferers undergoing the Botox treatment.[80][81]\\r\\nSince then, several randomized control trials have shown botulinum toxin type A to improve headache symptoms and quality of life when used prophylactically for patients with chronic migraine[82] who exhibit headache characteristics consistent with: pressure perceived from outside source, shorter total duration of chronic migraines (<30 years), \\"detoxification\\" of patients with coexisting chronic daily headache due to medication overuse, and no current history of other preventive headache medications.[83]\\r\\nA few small trials have found benefits in people with depression.[84][85]\\r\\nThe drug is under development for the treatment of premature ejaculation.[85]","input":"What is the most toxic substance to humans?"},{"output":"Gulfport","context":"Mississippi is a state located in the Southern United States.

The conversion of nitrogen can be carried out through both biological and physical processes. Important processes in the nitrogen cycle include fixation, ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification. The majority of Earth's atmosphere (78%) is nitrogen,[1] making it the largest source of nitrogen. However, atmospheric nitrogen has limited availability for biological use, leading to a scarcity of usable nitrogen in many types of ecosystems. The nitrogen cycle is of particular interest to ecologists because nitrogen availability can affect the rate of key ecosystem processes, including primary production and decomposition. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers, and release of nitrogen in wastewater have dramatically altered the global nitrogen cycle.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4), nitrite (NO?\\r\\n2), nitrate (NO?\\r\\n3), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N2). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, humus or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes of the nitrogen cycle transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by microbes, either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the nitrogenous wastes in animal urine are broken down by nitrifying bacteria in the soil to be used as new. The diagram besides shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.\\r\\nConversion of nitrogen into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called as nitrogen fixation. Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or \\"fixed\\", in a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x1012 and 10x1012 g per year are fixed by lightning strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or symbiotic bacteria known as diazotrophs. These bacteria have the nitrogenase enzyme that combines gaseous nitrogen with hydrogen to produce ammonia, which is converted by the bacteria into other organic compounds. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some Archaea. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component enzyme that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.[3] An example of free-living bacteria is Azotobacter. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium usually live in the root nodules of legumes (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a mutualistic relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for carbohydrates. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such symbioses. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the Haber-Bosch process,[4] which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.[5]\\r\\nPlants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.[5] In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between Rhizobia bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.[6] While many animals, fungi, and other heterotrophic organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of amino acids, nucleotides, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many bacteria) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources. Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.\\r\\nWhen a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is organic. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4), a process called ammonification or mineralization. Enzymes involved are:\\r\\nThe conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH+\\r\\n4) is performed by bacteria such as the Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO?\\r\\n2). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites (NO?\\r\\n2) into nitrates (NO?\\r\\n3).[5] It is important for the ammonia (NH\\r\\n3) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.\\r\\nDue to their very high solubility and because soils are highly unable to retain anions, nitrates can enter groundwater. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause methemoglobinemia or blue-baby syndrome.[9][10] Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to eutrophication, a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen fertilizer has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.\\r\\nDenitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N2), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as Pseudomonas and Clostridium in anaerobic conditions.[5] They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.\\r\\nDissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium?(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an anaerobic respiration?process.?Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to?nitrite, then?ammonium?(NO3?LNO2?LNH4+).[11] Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.[12]\\r\\nIn this biological process, nitrite and ammonia are converted directly into molecular nitrogen (N2) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans. The balanced formula for this \\"anammox\\" chemical reaction is: NH+\\r\\n4 + NO?\\r\\n2 => N2 + 2H2O (G = -357 kJ mol-1).[13]\\r\\nThough nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most ecosystems, in areas with nitrogen-rich bedrock, the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source.[14][15][16]\\r\\nThe nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N2 from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by phytoplankton as N2 so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by cyanobacteria.[17] Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years.[18] Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter. Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the euphotic zone by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.[19] Ammonification or Mineralization is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. Nitrification can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.[20] Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N2 can be returned to the atmosphere through denitrification.\\r\\nAmmonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a redox reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction (nitrate reductase). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include Prochlorococcus and some Synechococcus.[18] These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.\\r\\nThe nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in oligotrophic waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production.[21] The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.\\r\\nNitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and chlorophyll levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as HNLC (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean.\\r\\nAmmonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50ÿ80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column.[18] The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate.[18] Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.\\r\\nNitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer. [17] The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.\\r\\nNew production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest.[22] Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.\\r\\nAs a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly soy, alfalfa, and clover), growing use of the HaberÿBosch process in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms.[10] In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and industrial agriculture are highest.[23]\\r\\nNitrous oxide (N2O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources.[24] N2O has deleterious effects in the stratosphere, where it breaks down and acts as a catalyst in the destruction of atmospheric ozone. Nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas and is currently the third largest contributor to global warming, after carbon dioxide and methane. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet.[25]\\r\\nAmmonia (NH3) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an aerosol, decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in nitric acid (HNO3) that produces acid rain. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems.\\r\\nThe very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature combustion has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NOx.\\r\\nAmmonia and nitrous oxides actively alter atmospheric chemistry. They are precursors of tropospheric (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to smog and acid rain, damages plants and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems.[26] Ecosystem processes can increase with nitrogen fertilization, but anthropogenic input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans.[10]\\r\\nDecreases in biodiversity can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species-diverse heathlands.[27]\\r\\nAdditional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; eutrophication of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans.[28] Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic dead zones near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced hypoxia.[29][30] The New York Adirondack Lakes, Catskills, Hudson Highlands, Rensselaer Plateau and parts of Long Island display the impact of nitric acid rain deposition, resulting in the killing of fish and many other aquatic species.[31]\\r\\nAmmonia (NH3) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via aeration prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.","input":"What process releases nitrogen gas into the atmosphere?"},{"output":"Never Say Die","context":"Alex Rider is a series of spy novels by British author Anthony Horowitz about a 14ÿ15-year-old spy named Alex Rider. The series is aimed primarily at young adults. The series comprises eleven novels, as well as five graphic novels, three short stories and a supplementary book. The first novel, Stormbreaker, was released in the United Kingdom in 2000 and was adapted into a motion picture in 2006 starring Alex Pettyfer. A video game was released in 2006, based on the film which received negative reviews. The novels are published by Walker Books in the United Kingdom. They were first published by Puffin in the United States, but have been published more recently by Philomel Books, also an imprint of Penguin Books.[1] The audio books are read by Simon Prebble.[2] The eleventh novel, Never Say Die, was released in June 2017. Horowitz has had great success with the series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nStormbreaker was published in 2000 in the United Kingdom and in 2001 in the United States. Alex, the main character, is recruited by MI6 after discovering the truth about his uncle's life and death. He is sent to complete his uncle's latest mission: To investigate a multimillionaire named Herod Sayle and his creation, the revolutionary and newly developed computer called Stormbreaker, which Sayle is donating to every school in England. Alex later discovers that the Stormbreakers contain a deadly virus and that Sayle is planning to kill British schoolchildren. In the end, Alex foils his plan and succeeds in his first mission.\\r\\nPoint Blanc was published in the United Kingdom in 2001, and in North America in 2002 under the name Point Blank. After the death of two billionaires, MI6 discovers a connection: the two men who died both had a son attending Point Blanc, a school for rebellious sons of billionaires located in the French Alps, owned by a scientist named Dr. Hugo Grief. MI6 sends Alex to investigate Point Blanc and Alex discovers that Grief is replacing the students with clones of himself, who are plastic surgically resembled as the students, so that Grief can inherit the fortune and have complete power to rule the world. However, Alex foils his plan and succeeds again.\\r\\nSkeleton Key was published in 2002. After foiling a Triad plot to fix the 2001 Wimbledon tennis tournament by knocking out one of their members with a carbon dioxide tank, Alex is in grave danger of assassination. Forced to leave the country, MI6 sends him on a mission to Cuba with two CIA agents (one of which believes that he isn't helpful), where he is the only one of the three to survive. He encounters a former Soviet general, Alexei Sarov, with ideas for a nuclear holocaust and world domination under communist rule and who tries to adopt Alex Rider.\\r\\nEagle Strike was published in 2003. Damian Cray, a world-famous pop star, hopes to destroy the world's drug-making countries by hijacking the United States' nuclear arsenal. Suspicious of him, Alex takes Cray on without the help of the sceptical MI6. Cray releases a state-of-the-art games console called the 'Gameslayer'. Its first game, 'Feathered Serpent', is much more than it seems. It is up to Alex to discover the connection between the pop star, the video game, and the bombing of his vacation home. In the end, he will uncover a much larger plot, one involving the US government and the world's security. Alex got caught spying and was forced into a real life version of 'Feathered Serpent' and manages to escape by cheating the way only a real human can unlike an avatar. He leaves Damian Cray's mansion but not before stealing a vital piece of equipment that Damian needs to make his plan work. He is then forced to give it up because Damian had kidnapped Sabina who is his love interest.\\r\\nScorpia was published in 2004. Following the advice of the assassin Yassen Gregorovich, Alex tries to find the criminal organization \\"Scorpia\\" to find out the truth about his father. He is soon recruited by Scorpia and trains as an assassin where he discovers that he will assassinate Mrs Jones. He fails in this mission, but then is turned back onto MI6's side and returns to Scorpia as a double agent. He discovers their plot to kill British school children and foils it.\\r\\nArk Angel, published in 2005, follows Alex's second mission for the C.I.A. He investigates Nikolei Drevin who builds a hotel in outer space called \\"Ark Angel\\". Drevin secretly tries to destroy Washington D.C., the capital of the U.S. and targets the Pentagon, hoping to destroy files on him that the US have acquired. Alex must fight for his life in this novel.\\r\\nSnakehead was published in 2007. Taking place immediately after Ark Angel, the novel sees Alex recruited by ASIS, Australia's secret service, to infiltrate a Snakehead organization by posing as an Afghan refugee. Alex meets his godfather, Ash (Anthony Sean Howell), and confronts the organization Scorpia for the second time. He learns that Ash was actually working with Scorpia and was the main antagonist of the novel and then escapes from the trap.\\r\\nCrocodile Tears was published in 2009. MI6 coerces Alex into spying on activities at a GM crop plant during a school trip.\\r\\nScorpia Rising was published in 2011. In the book, Scorpia is hired to return the Elgin Marbles to Greece. Scorpia's plan includes the laying of a false trail to Cairo and blackmailing MI6 into returning the Marbles. MI6 falls for the trap and Alex is sent to Cairo, where he is dismayed to find that Scorpia has been pulling the strings all along. Alex is captured by Scorpia and manages to help his long time friend and carer Jack escape. Scorpia anticipated this and laid a trap for Jack. Alex is destroyed by the news that she is killed. The book ends when Alex escapes and moves to America with Sabina's family. It is heavily implied he is changed forever and will never go back to his spy life.\\r\\nRussian Roulette was published in 2013. It serves as a prequel to the series and describes the life of Yassen Gregorovich, unlike the other books in the series which centre mainly on Alex Rider.\\r\\nNever Say Die was published in June 2017 with a US release in October 2017. After the events of Scorpia Rising, Alex is left traumatised from the death of his caregiver and close friend, Jack Starbright. After being given a glimmer of hope about her survival, Alex is thrust into the horrors of his past in a battle to recover his friend from the dead. Along the way, he must encounter new foes who are nothing like anyone he has battled before. [3]\\r\\nThe twelfth book in the series; Nightshade, was alluded to at the end of Never Say Die and confirmed by Anthony Horowitz in May 2017. It will likely follow Alex in a battle against a new criminal organisation (after the death of Scorpia).

The riots remain the largest civil and racially charged insurrection in American history, aside from the Civil War itself.[4]\\r\\nU.S. President Abraham Lincoln diverted several regiments of militia and volunteer troops after the Battle of Gettysburg to control the city. The rioters were overwhelmingly working-class men, mostly Irish or of Irish descent, who feared free black people competing for work and resented that wealthier men, who could afford to pay a $300 (equivalent to $9,157 in 2017[5]) commutation fee to hire a substitute, were spared from the draft.[6][7]\\r\\nInitially intended to express anger at the draft, the protests turned into a race riot, with white rioters, predominantly Irish immigrants,[4] attacking black people throughout the city. The official death toll was listed at either 119 or 120 individuals. Conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool, commander of the Department of the East, said on July 16 that \\"Martial law ought to be proclaimed, but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it.\\"[8]\\r\\nThe military did not reach the city until the second day of rioting, by which time the mobs had ransacked or destroyed numerous public buildings, two Protestant churches, the homes of various abolitionists or sympathizers, many black homes, and the Colored Orphan Asylum at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, which was burned to the ground.[9]\\r\\nThe area's demographics changed as a result of the riot. Many black residents left Manhattan permanently with many moving to Brooklyn. By 1865, the black population fell below 11,000 for the first time since 1820.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York's economy was tied to the South; by 1822 nearly half of its exports were cotton shipments.[10] In addition, upstate textile mills processed cotton in manufacturing. New York had such strong business connections to the South that on January 7, 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood, a Democrat, called on the city's Board of Aldermen to \\"declare the city's independence from Albany and from Washington\\"; he said it \\"would have the whole and united support of the Southern States.\\"[11] When the Union entered the war, New York City had many sympathizers with the South.[12]\\r\\nThe city was also a continuing destination of immigrants. Since the 1840s, most were from Ireland and Germany. In 1860, nearly 25 percent of the New York City population was German-born, and many did not speak English. During the 1840s and 1850s, journalists had published sensational accounts, directed at the white working class, dramatizing the \\"evils\\" of interracial socializing, relationships, and marriages. Reformers joined the effort.[9] Newspapers carried derogatory portrayals of black people and ridiculed \\"black aspirations for equal rights in voting, education, and employment\\". Pseudo-scientific lectures on phrenology were popular, although countered by doctors.[12] At the time, some areas of the city, such as Lower Manhattan, had mixed populations of residents.\\r\\nThe Democratic Party Tammany Hall political machine had been working to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English. In March 1863, with the war continuing, Congress passed the Enrollment Act to establish a draft for the first time, as more troops were needed. In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned they were expected to register for the draft to fight for their new country. Black men were excluded from the draft as they were largely not considered citizens, and wealthier white men could pay for substitutes.[9]\\r\\nNew York political offices, including the mayor, were historically held by Democrats before the war, but the election of Abraham Lincoln as president had demonstrated the rise in Republican political power nationally. Newly-elected New York City Republican Mayor George Opdyke was mired in profiteering scandals in the months leading up to the riots. The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863 alarmed much of the white working class in New York, who feared that freed slaves would migrate to the city and add further competition to the labor market. There had already been tensions between black and white workers since the 1850s, particularly at the docks, with free blacks and immigrants competing for low-wage jobs in the city. In March 1863, white longshoremen refused to work with black laborers and rioted, attacking 200 black men.[9]\\r\\nThere were reports of rioting in Buffalo, New York, and certain other cities, but the first drawing of draft numberson July 11, 1863occurred peaceably in Manhattan. The second drawing was held on Monday, July 13, 1863, ten days after the Union victory at Gettysburg. At 10 a.m., a furious crowd of around 500, led by the volunteer firemen of Engine Company 33 (known as the \\"Black Joke\\"), attacked the assistant Ninth District provost marshal's office, at Third Avenue and 47th Street, where the draft was taking place.[13]\\r\\nThe crowd threw large paving stones through windows, burst through the doors, and set the building ablaze.[14] When the fire department responded, rioters broke up their vehicles. Others killed horses that were pulling streetcars and smashed the cars. To prevent other parts of the city being notified of the riot, they cut telegraph lines.[13]\\r\\nSince the New York State Militia had been sent to assist Union troops at Gettysburg, the local New York Metropolitan Police Department was the only force on hand to try to suppress the riots.[14] Police Superintendent John Kennedy arrived at the site on Monday to check on the situation. Although not in uniform, people in the mob recognized him and attacked him. Kennedy was left nearly unconscious, his face bruised and cut, his eye injured, his lips swollen, and his hand cut with a knife. He had been beaten to a mass of bruises and blood all over his body.[3]\\r\\nPolice drew their clubs and revolvers and charged the crowd but were overpowered.[15] The police were badly outnumbered and unable to quell the riots, but they kept the rioting out of Lower Manhattan below Union Square.[3] Immigrants and others in the \\"Bloody Sixth\\" Ward, around the South Street Seaport and Five Points areas, refrained from involvement in the rioting.[16]\\r\\nThe Bull's Head hotel on 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the mob, was burned. The mayor's residence on Fifth Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included the office of the New York Times. The mob was turned back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond.[17] Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday.[15] Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street.[13] The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.[13]\\r\\nThe Colored Orphan Asylum at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue, a \\"symbol of white charity to blacks and of black upward mobility\\"[9] that provided shelter for 233 children, was attacked by a mob at around 4 p.m. A mob of several thousand, including many women and children, looted the building of its food and supplies. However, the police were able to secure the orphanage for enough time to allow the orphans to escape before the building burned down.[18] Throughout the areas of rioting, mobs attacked and killed at least 120 black people and destroyed their known homes and businesses, such as James McCune Smith's pharmacy at 93 West Broadway, believed to be the first owned by a black man in the United States.[9]\\r\\nNear the midtown docks, tensions brewing since the mid-1850s boiled over. As recently as March 1863, white employers had hired black longshoremen, with whom Irish men refused to work. Rioters went into the streets in search of \\"all the negro porters, cartmen and laborers ...\\" to attempt to remove all evidence of a black and interracial social life from the area near the docks. White dockworkers attacked and destroyed brothels, dance halls, boarding houses, and tenements that catered to black people. Mobs stripped the clothing off the white owners of these businesses.[9]\\r\\nHeavy rain fell on Monday night, helping to abate the fires and sending rioters home, but the crowds returned the next day. Rioters burned down the home of Abby Gibbons, a prison reformer and the daughter of abolitionist Isaac Hopper. They also attacked white \\"amalgamationists\\", such as Ann Derrickson and Ann Martin, two white women who were married to black men, and Mary Burke, a white prostitute who catered to black men.[9][19]\\r\\nGovernor Horatio Seymour arrived on Tuesday and spoke at City Hall, where he attempted to assuage the crowd by proclaiming that the Conscription Act was unconstitutional. General John E. Wool, commander of the Eastern District, brought approximately 800 soldiers and Marines in from forts in New York Harbor, West Point, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He ordered the militias to return to New York.[15]\\r\\nThe situation improved on Wednesday, when assistant provost-marshal-general Robert Nugent received word from his superior officer, Colonel James Barnet Fry, to postpone the draft. As this news appeared in newspapers, some rioters stayed home. But some of the militias began to return and used harsh measures against the remaining mobs.[15]\\r\\nOrder began to be restored on Thursday. The New York State Militia and some federal troops were returned to New York, including the 152nd New York Volunteers, the 26th Michigan Volunteers, the 27th Indiana Volunteers and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia from Frederick, Maryland, after a forced march. In addition, the governor sent in the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York State Militia, which had not been in federal service, and a section of the 20th Independent Battery, New York Volunteer Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throggs Neck. The New York State Militia units were the first to arrive. By July 16, there were several thousand Federal troops in the city.[8]\\r\\nA final confrontation occurred on Thursday evening near Gramercy Park. According to Adrian Cook, twelve people died on the last day of the riots in skirmishes between rioters, the police, and the Army, including one African American, two soldiers, a bystander, and two women.[20]\\r\\nThe New York Times reported on Thursday that Plug Uglies and Blood Tubs gang members from Baltimore, as well as \\"Scuykill Rangers [sic] and other rowdies of Philadelphia\\", had come to New York during the unrest to participate in the riots alongside the Dead Rabbits and \\"Mackerelvillers\\". The Times editorialized that \\"the scoundrels cannot afford to miss this golden opportunity of indulging their brutal natures, and at the same time serving their colleagues the Copperheads and secesh [secessionist] sympathizers.\\"[21]\\r\\nThe exact death toll during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but according to historian James M. McPherson, 119 or 120 people were killed, most of them were black. In all, eleven black men were hanged over five days. The riots forced hundreds of black people to flee the city.[22] Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area.[9] Among the murdered blacks was the seven year old nephew of Bermudian First Sergeant Robert John Simmons of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, whose account of fighting in South Carolina, written on the approach to Fort Wagner 18 July, 1863, was to be published in the New York Tribune on the 23rd of December, 1863 (Simmons having died in August of wounds received in the attack on Fort Wagner).\\r\\nThe most reliable estimates indicate at least 2,000 people were injured. Herbert Asbury, the author of the 1928 book Gangs of New York, upon which the 2002 film was based, puts the figure much higher, at 2,000 killed and 8,000 wounded,[23] but it is not widely accepted.[24] Total property damage was about $1ÿ5 million ($19.9?million ÿ $99.4?million, adjusted for inflation).[23][25] The city treasury later indemnified one-quarter of the amount.\\r\\nHistorian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that the riots were \\"equivalent to a Confederate victory\\".[25] Fifty buildings, including two Protestant churches and the Colored Orphan Asylum, were burned to the ground. During the riots, landlords, fearing that the mob would destroy their buildings, drove black residents from their homes. As a result of the violence against them, hundreds of black people left New York, including physician James McCune Smith and his family, moving to Williamsburg, Brooklyn or New Jersey.[9]\\r\\nThe white elite in New York organized to provide relief to black riot victims, helping them find new work and homes. The Union League Club and the Committee of Merchants for the Relief of Colored People provided nearly $40,000 to 2,500 victims of the riots. By 1865 the black population in the city had dropped to under 10,000, the lowest since 1820. The white working-class riots had changed the demographics of the city, and white residents exerted their control in the workplace; they became \\"unequivocally divided\\" from the black population.[9]\\r\\nOn August 19, the government resumed the draft in New York. It was completed within 10 days without further incident. Fewer men were drafted than had been feared by the working class: of the 750,000 selected nationwide for conscription, only about 45,000 were sent into active duty.[26]\\r\\nWhile the rioting mainly involved the working class, middle and upper-class New Yorkers had split sentiments on the draft and use of federal power or martial law to enforce it. Many wealthy Democratic businessmen sought to have the draft declared unconstitutional. Tammany Democrats did not seek to have the draft declared unconstitutional, but they helped pay the commutation fees for those who were drafted.[27]\\r\\nIn December 1863, the Union League Club recruited more than 2,000 black soldiers, outfitted and trained them, honoring and sending men off with a parade through the city to the Hudson River docks in March 1864. A crowd of 100,000 watched the procession, which was led by police and members of the Union League Club.[9][28][29]\\r\\nNew York's support for the Union cause continued, however grudgingly, and gradually Southern sympathies declined in the city. New York banks eventually financed the Civil War, and the state's industries were more productive than those of the entire Confederacy. By the end of the war, more than 450,000 soldiers, sailors, and militia had enlisted from New York State, which was the most populous state at the time. A total of 46,000 military men from New York State died during the war, more from disease than wounds, as was typical of most combatants.[11]\\r\\nNew York Metropolitan Police Department under the command of Superintendent John A.

Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war.\\r\\nMost of the Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Treaty of Paris ended the war. The 1st and 2nd Regiments went on to form the nucleus of the Legion of the United States in 1792 under General Anthony Wayne. This became the foundation of the United States Army in 1796.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Continental Army consisted of soldiers from all 13 colonies and, after 1776, from all 13 states. When the American Revolutionary War began at the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, the colonial revolutionaries did not have an army. Previously, each colony had relied upon the militia, made up of part-time citizen-soldiers, for local defense, or the raising of temporary \\"provincial regiments\\" during specific crises such as the French and Indian War of 1754ÿ63. As tensions with Great Britain increased in the years leading to the war, colonists began to reform their militias in preparation for the perceived potential conflict. Training of militiamen increased after the passage of the Intolerable Acts in 1774. Colonists such as Richard Henry Lee proposed forming a national militia force, but the First Continental Congress rejected the idea.[1]\\r\\nOn April 23, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress authorized the raising of a colonial army consisting of 26 company regiments. New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut soon raised similar but smaller forces. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress decided to proceed with the establishment of a Continental Army for purposes of common defense, adopting the forces already in place outside Boston (22,000 troops) and New York (5,000).[2] It also raised the first ten companies of Continental troops on a one-year enlistment, riflemen from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia to be used as light infantry,[2] who became the 1st Continental Regiment in 1776.\\r\\nOn June 15, 1775, the Congress elected by unanimous vote George Washington as Commander-in-Chief, who accepted and served throughout the war without any compensation except for reimbursement of expenses.[3][4][5][6]\\r\\nOn July 18, 1775, the Congress requested all colonies form militia companies from \\"all able bodied effective men, between sixteen and fifty years of age.\\" It was not uncommon for men younger than sixteen to enlist as most colonies had no requirement of parental consent for those under twenty-one (adulthood).[7]\\r\\nFour major-generals (Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam) and eight brigadier-generals (Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery, David Wooster, William Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas, John Sullivan, and Nathanael Greene) were appointed by the Second Continental Congress in the course of a few days.[8][9][10] After Pomeroy did not accept, John Thomas was appointed in his place.[11]\\r\\nAs the Continental Congress increasingly adopted the responsibilities and posture of a legislature for a sovereign state, the role of the Continental Army became the subject of considerable debate. Some Americans had a general aversion to maintaining a standing army; but on the other hand the requirements of the war against the British required the discipline and organization of a modern military. As a result, the army went through several distinct phases, characterized by official dissolution and reorganization of units.\\r\\nSoldiers in the Continental Army were citizens who had volunteered to serve in the army (but were paid), and at various times during the war, standard enlistment periods lasted from one to three years. Early in the war the enlistment periods were short, as the Continental Congress feared the possibility of the Continental Army evolving into a permanent army. The army never numbered more than 17,000 men. Turnover proved a constant problem, particularly in the winter of 1776ÿ77, and longer enlistments were approved. Broadly speaking, Continental forces consisted of several successive armies, or establishments:\\r\\nIn addition to the Continental Army regulars, local militia units, raised and funded by individual colonies/states, participated in battles throughout the war. Sometimes the militia units operated independently of the Continental Army, but often local militias were called out to support and augment the Continental Army regulars during campaigns. (The militia troops developed a reputation for being prone to premature retreats, a fact that Brigadier-General Daniel Morgan integrated into his strategy at the Battle of Cowpens in 1781.)\\r\\nThe financial responsibility for providing pay, food, shelter, clothing, arms, and other equipment to specific units was assigned to states as part of the establishment of these units. States differed in how well they lived up to these obligations. There were constant funding issues and morale problems as the war continued. This led to the army offering low pay, often rotten food, hard work, cold, heat, poor clothing and shelter, harsh discipline, and a high chance of becoming a casualty.\\r\\nAt the time of the Siege of Boston, the Continental Army at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in June 1775, is estimated to have numbered from 14ÿ16,000 men from New England (though the actual number may have been as low as 11,000 because of desertions). Until Washington's arrival, it remained under the command of Artemas Ward, while John Thomas acted as executive officer and Richard Gridley commanded the artillery corps and was chief engineer. It was during this siege that Washington allegedly uttered his famous words, \\"It is cold out here.\\" This was a poetic representation of the harsh conditions the men endured during the summer of the siege, and a reference to a political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin. It served as a piece of satire as it was a remark about cold conditions, while the men experienced some of the hottest temperatures of that year.\\r\\nThe British force in Boston was increasing by fresh arrivals. It numbered then about 10,000 men. Major Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, had arrived late in May and joined General Gage in forming and executing plans for dispersing the rebels. Feeling strong with these veteran officers and soldiers around himand the presence of several Men-of-War under Admiral Gravesthe governor issued a proclamation, declaring martial law, branding the entire Continental Army and supporters as \\"rebels\\" and \\"parricides of the Constitution.\\" Amnesty was offered to those who gave up their allegiance to the Continental Army and Congress in favor of the British authorities, though Samuel Adams and John Hancock were still wanted for high treason. This proclamation only served to strengthen the resolve of the Congress and Army.\\r\\nAfter the British evacuation of Boston (prompted by the placement of Continental artillery overlooking the city in March 1776), the Continental Army relocated to New York. For the next five years, the main bodies of the Continental and British armies campaigned against one another in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. These campaigns included the notable battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, and Morristown, among many others.\\r\\nThe Continental Army was racially integrated, a condition the United States Army would not see again until Truman ordered the desegregation of the military in 1948. African American slaves were promised freedom in exchange for military service in New England, and made up one fifth of the Northern Continental Army.[12]\\r\\nThroughout its existence, the Army was troubled by poor logistics, inadequate training, short-term enlistments, interstate rivalries, and Congress's inability to compel the states to provide food, money or supplies. In the beginning, soldiers enlisted for a year, largely motivated by patriotism; but as the war dragged on, bounties and other incentives became more commonplace. Two major mutinies late in the war drastically diminished the reliability of two of the main units, and there were constant discipline problems.\\r\\nThe army increased its effectiveness and success rate through a series of trials and errors, often at great human cost. General Washington and other distinguished officers were instrumental leaders in preserving unity, learning and adapting, and ensuring discipline throughout the eight years of war. In the winter of 1777ÿ1778, with the addition of Baron von Steuben, of Prussian origin, the training and discipline of the Continental Army began to vastly improve. (This was the infamous winter at Valley Forge.) Washington always viewed the Army as a temporary measure and strove to maintain civilian control of the military, as did the Continental Congress, though there were minor disagreements about how this was carried out.\\r\\nNear the end of the war, the Continental Army was augmented by a French expeditionary force (under General Rochambeau) and a squadron of the French navy (under the Comte de Barras), and in the late summer of 1781 the main body of the army travelled south to Virginia to rendezvous with the French West Indies fleet under Admiral Comte de Grasse. This resulted in the Siege of Yorktown, the decisive Battle of the Chesapeake, and the surrender of the British southern army. This essentially marked the end of the land war in America, although the Continental Army returned to blockade the British northern army in New York until the peace treaty went into effect two years later, and battles took place elsewhere between British forces and those of France and its allies.\\r\\nA small residual force remained at West Point and some frontier outposts until Congress created the United States Army by their resolution of June 3, 1784.\\r\\nPlanning for the transition to a peacetime force had begun in April 1783 at the request of a congressional committee chaired by Alexander Hamilton. The commander-in-chief discussed the problem with key officers before submitting the army's official views on 2 May. Significantly, there was a broad consensus of the basic framework among the officers. Washington's proposal called for four components: a small regular army, a uniformly trained and organized militia, a system of arsenals, and a military academy to train the army's artillery and engineer officers. He wanted four infantry regiments, each assigned to a specific sector of the frontier, plus an artillery regiment. His proposed regimental organizations followed Continental Army patterns but had a provision for increased strength in the event of war. Washington expected the militia primarily to provide security for the country at the start of a war until the regular army could expandthe same role it had carried out in 1775 and 1776. Steuben and Duportail submitted their own proposals to Congress for consideration.\\r\\nAlthough Congress declined on May 12 to make a decision on the peace establishment, it did address the need for some troops to remain on duty until the British evacuated New York City and several frontier posts. The delegates told Washington to use men enlisted for fixed terms as temporary garrisons. A detachment of those men from West Point reoccupied New York without incident on November 25. When Steuben's effort in July to negotiate a transfer of frontier forts with Major General Frederick Haldimand collapsed, however, the British maintained control over them, as they would into the 1790s. That failure and the realization that most of the remaining infantrymen's enlistments were due to expire by June 1784 led Washington to order Knox, his choice as the commander of the peacetime army, to discharge all but 500 infantry and 100 artillerymen before winter set in. The former regrouped as Jackson's Continental Regiment under Colonel Henry Jackson of Massachusetts. The single artillery company, New Yorkers under John Doughty, came from remnants of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment.\\r\\nCongress issued a proclamation on October 18, 1783, which approved Washington's reductions. On November 2, Washington then released his Farewell Order to the Philadelphia newspapers for nationwide distribution to the furloughed men. In the message he thanked the officers and men for their assistance and reminded them that \\"the singular interpositions of Providence in our feeble condition were such, as could scarcely escape the attention of the most unobserving; while the unparalleled perseverance of the Armies of the United States, through almost every possible suffering and discouragement for the space of eight long years, was little short of a standing miracle.\\"\\r\\nWashington believed that the blending of persons from every colony into \\"one patriotic band of Brothers\\" had been a major accomplishment, and he urged the veterans to continue this devotion in civilian life.\\r\\nWashington said farewell to his remaining officers on December 4 at Fraunces Tavern in New York City. On December 23 he appeared in Congress, then sitting at Annapolis, and returned his commission as commander-in-chief: \\"Having now finished the work assigned me, I retire from the great theatre of Action; and bidding an Affectionate farewell to this August body under whose orders I have so long acted, I here offer my Commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.\\" Congress ended the War of American Independence on January 14, 1784, by ratifying the definitive peace treaty that had been signed in Paris on September 3.\\r\\nCongress had again rejected Washington's concept for a peacetime force in October 1783. When moderate delegates then offered an alternative in April 1784 which scaled the projected army down to 900 men in one artillery and three infantry battalions, Congress rejected it as well, in part because New York feared that men retained from Massachusetts might take sides in a land dispute between the two states. Another proposal to retain 350 men and raise 700 new recruits also failed. On June 2 Congress ordered the discharge of all remaining men except twenty-five caretakers at Fort Pitt and fifty-five at West Point. The next day it created a peace establishment acceptable to all interests.\\r\\nThe plan required four states to raise 700 men for one year's service. Congress instructed the Secretary at War to form the troops into eight infantry and two artillery companies. Pennsylvania, with a quota of 260 men, had the power to nominate a lieutenant colonel, who would be the senior officer. New York and Connecticut each were to raise 165 men and nominate a major; the remaining 110 men came from New Jersey. Economy was the watchword of this proposal, for each major served as a company commander, and line officers performed all staff duties except those of chaplain, surgeon, and surgeon's mate. Under Josiah Harmar, the First American Regiment slowly organized and achieved permanent status as an infantry regiment of the new Regular Army. The lineage of the First American Regiment is carried on by the 3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard).\\r\\nHowever the United States military realized it needed a well-trained standing army following St. Clair's Defeat on November 4, 1791, when a force led by General Arthur St. Clair was almost entirely wiped out by the Western Confederacy near Fort Recovery, Ohio. The plans, which were supported by U.S. President George Washington and Henry Knox, Secretary of War, led to the disbandment of the Continental Army and the creation of the Legion of the United States. The command would be based on the 18th-century military works of Henry Bouquet, a professional Swiss soldier who served as a colonel in the British army, and French Marshal Maurice de Saxe. In 1792 Anthony Wayne, a renowned hero of the American Revolutionary War, was encouraged to leave retirement and return to active service as Commander-in-Chief of the Legion with the rank of Major General.\\r\\nThe legion was recruited and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was formed into four sub-legions. These were created from elements of the 1st and 2nd Regiments from the Continental Army. These units then became the First and Second Sub-Legions. The Third and Fourth Sub-Legions were raised from further recruits. From June 1792 to November 1792, the Legion remained cantoned at Fort LaFayette in Pittsburgh. Throughout the winter of 1792ÿ93, existing troops along with new recruits were drilled in military skills, tactics and discipline at Legionville on the banks of the Ohio River near present-day Baden, Pennsylvania. The following Spring the newly named Legion of the United States left Legionville for the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between American Indian tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy in the area south of the Ohio River. The overwhelmingly successful campaign was concluded with the decisive victory at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, Maj. Gen. Anthony Wayne applied the techniques of wilderness operations perfected by Sullivan's 1779 expedition against the Iroquois. The training the troops received at Legionville was also seen as an instrumental to this overwhelming victory.\\r\\nNevertheless, Steuben's Blue Book remained the official manual for the legion, as well as for the militia of most states, until Winfield Scott in 1835. In 1796, the United States Army was raised following the discontinuation with the legion of the United States. This preceded the graduation of the first cadets from United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, which was established in 1802.\\r\\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Army initially wore ribbons, cockades and epaulettes of various colors as an ad hoc form of rank insignia, as General George Washington wrote in 1775:\\r\\n\\"As the Continental Army has unfortunately no uniforms, and consequently many inconveniences must arise from not being able to distinguish the commissioned officers from the privates, it is desired that some badge of distinction be immediately provided; for instance that the field officers may have red or pink colored cockades in their hats, the captains yellow or buff, and the subalterns green.\\"\\r\\nIn 1776 captains were to have buff or white cockades.\\r\\nLater on in the war, the Continental Army established its own uniform with a black cockade (as used in much of the British Army) among all ranks and the following insignia:","input":"When was washington appointed general of the continental army?"},{"output":"Bay Hill, Florida, a suburb southwest of Orlando","context":"The Bay Hill Club and Lodge is a private golf resort in the southeastern United States, located in Bay Hill, Florida, a suburb southwest of Orlando.\\r\\nThe first 18 holes at Bay Hill (Champion / Challenger nines) were designed by Dick Wilson in 1961, and was built by Bob Simmons.

She is the subject of his 2007 young adult fiction mystery novel Thirteen Reasons Why, which was adapted by the media company Netflix as 13 Reasons Why. Hannah is introduced as a sophomore at the fictional Liberty High School; she struggles to adjust to living in an unsympathetic school environment. In the television series, Baker is played by Katherine Langford, who is signed on to appear in the show's second season set to air in 2018.[1]\\r\\n13 Reasons Why was a breakout success; it became one of Netflix's highest rated shows and the most-tweeted series shortly after its release. Although critics were divided on the treatment of Hannah's characterher death in particularthey were unanimous in their praise for Langford, who received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. She was catapulted to worldwide attention and was variously called \\"a revelation\\", \\"believable and raw\\", and \\"magnetic\\". Daniel Montgomery of the Gold Derby said she was an early frontrunner for an Emmy Award nomination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHannah moved to Crestmont, where she attended Liberty High School as a junior. She worked at the Crestmont Movie Theater with Clay Jensen, a shy introverted classmate. Hannah is an extroverted, and thoughtful, girl; her character lacks awareness of the true intentions of others. Her parents are Olivia and Andy Baker.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the series, 16-year-old schoolgirl Hannah Baker commits suicide by slitting her wristsin the novel she swallows an overdose of tablets. Her school locker becomes a memorial adorned with students' letters. On his doorstep, Hanna's friend Clay Jensen finds a box containing audio cassette tapes containing a recording of Hannah talking about her suicide.\\r\\nClay listens to the first tape, on which Hannah narrates the events that led to her suicide. She talks about her first kiss with Justin Foley, who later spreads a rumor about their encounter. Justin's friend Bryce Walker forwards Hanna's private photograph from his phone to everyone at school, further embarrassing her. Clay recalls being rude to Hannah about her leaked photograph. Each subsequent tape reveals the thirteen reasons she killed herself. Hannah warns listeners to follow certain rules; everyone mentioned on the tapes must listen to the complete set then pass it along to the next person addressed. If they fail to do so, a second set of tapes, held by a friend not on the tapes, will be released. Clay, who was secretly in love with Hannah, reminisces about the time he spent with her. He finds listening to Hannah's story difficult, but his friend Tony finds him and reveals he helped Hannah record the tapes and knows Clay is mentioned on them. He warns Clay things will go wrong if he does not obey the tapes.[2]\\r\\nOn the B side of the first tape, Hannah talks about her friendship with Jessica Davis and Alex Standall, who later start dating and stop hanging out with Hannah. When Alex breaks up with Jessica, she blames Hannah for the breakup and slaps her in public.[3] Alex is the subject of the A side of the second tape. In the present, Hannah's mother, Olivia Baker, finds the list at her house, leading her to believe her daughter was being bullied. She seeks the school principal's help. Clay turns to Alex for answers and reveals he made the list to get back at Jessica, who refused to have sex with him.[4]\\r\\nAs Clay progresses through the tapes, he encounters the other people mentioned on Hannah's recordings. He discovers everyone on the tapes either took advantage of Hannah or abandoned her. Tyler Down, the school photographer, stalks Hannah and distributes a photograph of her and closet lesbian Courtney Crimsen kissing.[5] Afraid of her classmates discovering her sexuality, Courtney spreads a rumor that the girls in the leaked photos are Hannah and Laura, another lesbian classmate, and adds to the rumor about Hannah and Justin.[6] Marcus Cole humiliates Hannah in public,[7] and Zach Dempsey steals her class notes as revenge for her blaming and rejecting him.[8]\\r\\nHannah later joins a poetry club where she meets fellow student Ryan Shaver, who publishes her personal poem against her wishes in his school magazine.[9] Hannah attends a party at Jessica's house; while hiding in Jessica's room, Hannah watches Bryce raping an unconscious and intoxicated Jessica, with Justin's consent.[10] Hannah is afraid to tell anyone and decides to leave. Sheri Holland, the subject of the next tape, offers Hannah a ride home but abandons her after crashing her car, which later leads to the death of Jeff Atkins.[11] In the present day, Tony confides in Clay about the night of Hannah's death.\\r\\nClay struggles to continue listening to Hannah's recordings, thinking he has let her down.

Her rape is the final event leading her to decision to end her life.[13] In the present day, Olivia finds a list with all the names of the people on the tapes, but does not know what it means. The Bakers decide to file a lawsuit against the school and everyone on the list is subpoenaed.\\r\\nOn the final tape, Hannah recalls the day of her suicide. She decides to give life \\"one more try\\" and visits school counselor Mr. Porter and asks for his help. She tells him about the rape but refuses to disclose her rapist's identity. Porter tells her to move on with life. Hannah leaves her uniform on the counter at the theatre before delivering the tapes to Tony. Hannah returns home, fills her bathtub and slits her wrists with razors. Hannah dies of blood loss and is found by her parents, who attempt to save her by calling 911 but they are too late.[14]\\r\\nAsher's book was criticized for the poor characterization of Hannah Baker, which many critics said the television series improved upon.[16][17] In her book review for The Guardian, Katherine Hughes wrote that Hannah \\"comes across not so much as a young soul in distress as a vengeful harpy\\".[18] The character was inspired by one of Ashers relatives, who had tried to commit suicide.[19]\\r\\nAt the beginning to the series, Hannah is a 16-year-old high school junior, \\"from a white picket fence town with an almost perfect family\\".[20] Noting the realism and relatability of the character with real-life people, Quinn Keaney of Popsugar wrote that Hannah, \\"is just like you?... like someone you know; she's smart, she has a bright future ahead of herself, she has loving parents, she just wants to be liked\\".[21] Variety's Maureen Ryan offered a similar observation on the realistic portrayal of teenagers, writing that the \\"darkness\\" in Hannah's life is \\"constantly interwoven with the natural resilience and questioning optimism of adolescence\\".[22] Writing for TVLine, Andy Swift described her as \\"a fresh-faced teen with a bright future\\",[23] while Sarah Hughes of The Daily Telegraph called her \\"smart, funny, beautiful, and sometimes awkward in that way that teenagers are\\".[24]\\r\\nFor most of the story, Hannah is characterized by her struggle adjusting to an unsympathetic school environment and her \\"desire to fit in\\" which \\"trumps everything\\".[24] Her mental health deteriorates as she is subjected to bullying, slut-shaming, and physical assaults.[25] Towards the end of the narrative, Hannah's meeting with Mr. Porter marks her complete descent into depression.[26] While some critics lauded the honest treatment, Lauren Hoffman of Cosmopolitan said the series is so \\"enamored with this idea of Hannah as someone who does things to others that it neglects to tell us who she is herself\\". She said it was a failure of \\"telling a story\\" and a missed opportunity to \\"undo stigma around mental illness\\".[27]\\r\\nAlthough Hannah's story is mostly told by the use of voice-overs and flashbacks following her suicide,[28] her character is also viewed from the perspective of Clay Jensen.[29] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Asher said, \\"Clay is also the eyes and ears for the reader. Thats the person youre connecting with.\\"[29] Elaborating on the use of the first-person narrative style, Joanna Robinson of Vanity Fair wrote, \\"Clay's romantic treatment of Hannah as an unattainable dream girl\\", and that the idea undergoes some \\"smart and nuanced scrutiny\\"; so much so that it leads to a need for an assessment of his complicity in Hannah's death.[30] Vox's Constance Grady, who described Hannah as \\"attractively damaged but secretly pure, sarcastic but unthreatening [sic]\\", also acknowledged the connection between Clay and Hannah and wrote that the series heavily depended upon \\"a secret connection\\" between the two. [31] She said Langford's performance preserves the character's \\"wide-eyed vulnerability\\".[31]\\r\\nHannah Baker was played by Katherine Langford on the television series;[32] her first major acting credit. The show's director Tom McCarthy, script-writer Brian Yorkey, and the executive producer Selena Gomez selected Langford following a Skype audition. Yorkey called the casting process especially hard because of the extra effort needed to match the actor with the visions of the novel's readers. Speaking with James Gill of the Radio Times, he expressed his satisfaction on the casting of Langford and Dylan Minnette as the leading duo, and said, \\"It was well worth it, because it was about finding two people who could not only portray Hannah and Clay but really understand at a deep level what their journey is\\".[33]\\r\\nUniversal Studios purchased film rights to Asher's novel on February 8, 2011, and Gomez began the process of casting the role of Hannah Baker.[34] On October 29, 2015, it was announced that Netflix would be making a television adaptation of the book, with Gomez as an executive producer.[35] Tom McCarthy was hired to direct the first two episodes.[36] The series is produced by Anonymous Content and Paramount Television with Gomez, McCarthy, Joy Gorman, Michael Sugar, Steve Golin, Mandy Teefey, and Kristel Laiblin serving as executive producers.[36] Filming for the show took place in the Northern Californian towns of Vallejo, Benicia, San Rafael, Crockett and Sebastopol during the summer of 2016.[37][38] The first season and the special were released on Netflix on March 31, 2017.[39]\\r\\nThe character has received polarized responses from television critics and mental health analysts, but was well received by the readers and audience. Katherine Langford garnered acclaim for her performance in the television series and was variously called \\"a revelation\\", \\"believable and raw\\" and \\"magnetic\\".[32][40] Jesse Schedeen of IGN praised her performance stating, \\"Langford shines in the lead role [and] embodies that optimism and that profound sadness [of Hannah's] as well\\".[41] Daniel Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter praised Langford's \\"dynamic\\" performance and wrote, \\"Langford's heartbreaking openness makes you root for a fate you know isn't possible\\".[42] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe praised the chemistry of Langford and Minnette, saying, \\"watching these two young actors together is pure pleasure\\".[43] Schedeen of IGN agreed, saying the lead actors are \\"often at their best together, channeling just the right sort of warm but awkward chemistry you'd expect from two teens who can't quite admit to their feelings for one another\\".[41]","input":"How did hannah baker die in the show?"},{"output":"1960s","context":"The social model of disability is a reaction to the dominant medical model of disability which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.[1] The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s; the specific term emerged from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1975, the UK organization Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation (UPIAS) claimed: \\"In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society.\\"[2][3]\\r\\nIn 1983, the disabled academic Mike Oliver coined the phrase \\"social model of disability\\" in reference to these ideological developments.[4] Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS.[5]\\r\\nThe \\"social model\\" was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, US and other countries, and extended to include all disabled people, including those who have learning difficulties / learning disabilities / or who are mentally handicapped, or people with emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.[6][7]\\r\\nOliver did not intend the \\"social model of disability\\" to be an all encompassing theory of disability, rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability.[8]\\r\\nA fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups. Equal rights are said to give empowerment and the \\"ability\\" to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights campaigners, as with other social activism, is \\"Nothing About Us Without Us.\\"[9]\\r\\nThe social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of:\\r\\nThe social model of disability implies that attempts to change, \\"fix\\" or \\"cure\\" individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the patient, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted \\"treatments\\", while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them.[11] People diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum may argue against efforts to change them to be more like others. They argue instead for acceptance of neurodiversity and accommodation to different needs and goals.[12] Some people diagnosed with a mental disorder argue that they are just different and don't necessarily conform. The biopsychosocial model of disease/disability is a holistic attempt by practitioners to address this.[13]\\r\\nThe social model implies that practices such as eugenics are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. \\"Over 200,000 disabled people were the first victims of the Holocaust.\\"[14]\\r\\nA 1986 article stated: \\"It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be dismissed as if we all come under this one great metaphysical category 'the disabled'. The effect of this is a depersonalization, a sweeping dismissal of our individuality, and a denial of our right to be seen as people with our own uniqueness, rather than as the anonymous constituents of a category or group. These words that lump us all together -'the disabled', 'spina bifida', 'tetraplegic', 'muscular dystrophy, - are nothing more than terminological rubbish bins into which all the important things about us as people get thrown away.\\"[15]\\r\\nThe social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms \\"impairment\\" and \\"disability.\\" Impairment is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes), the abnormality, of a person, whether in terms of limbs, organs or mechanisms, including psychological. Disability is used to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equivalent attention and accommodation to the needs of individuals with impairments.[16]\\r\\nThe social model also relates to economics. It proposes that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. It addresses issues such as the under-estimation of the potential of people to contribute to society and add economic value to society, if given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they outperform competitors.[17]\\r\\nIn Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one fifth of the working age population was disabled - 7.1 million disabled people as opposed to 29.8 million able people - and in this analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were unwilling to enter the labour market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labour market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: \\"incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Persons Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission.\\"[18]\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, the Disability Discrimination Act defines disability using the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out \\"normal day-to-day activities.\\" But the requirement of employers and service providers to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model.[19] By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - according to the social model, they are effectively removing the person's disability. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality. This enforcement came in the shape of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006.[20] In 2010, The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) was amalgamated into the Equality Act 2010 along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. It extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a person with a disability is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful.[21] Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interview for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions.[22]\\r\\nIn the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), revision of 2008 effective in January 2009, is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.[23] It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race, religion, sex, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, such as alcoholism and transsexualism.\\r\\nIn 2007, the European Court of Justice in the Chacon Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA court case, defined disability narrowly according to a medical definition that excluded temporary illness, when considering the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability. This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.[citation needed]","input":"When was the social model of disability created?"},{"output":"thermal","context":"An ink cartridge or inkjet cartridge is a component of an inkjet printer that contains the ink that is deposited onto paper during printing.\\r\\nEach ink cartridge contains one or more ink reservoirs; certain producers also add electronic contacts and a chip that communicates with the printer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost consumer inkjet printers, such as those made by Canon, HP, and Lexmark (but not Epson) use a thermal inkjet; inside each partition of the ink reservoir is a heating element with a tiny metal plate or resistor. In response to a signal given by the printer, a tiny current flows through the metal or resistor making it warm, and the ink in contact with the heated resistor is vaporized into a tiny steam bubble inside the nozzle.[1] As a consequence, an ink droplet is forced out of the cartridge nozzle onto the paper. This process takes a fraction of a millisecond.\\r\\nThe printing depends on the smooth flow of ink, which can be hindered if the ink begins to dry at the print head, as can happen when an ink level becomes low. Dried ink can be cleaned from a cartridge print head using isopropyl alcohol or water.[2] Isopropyl alcohol will damage the printing head, IPA can dissolve the plastic at the connections and rubber gaskets. Tap water contains contaminants that may clog the print head, so distilled water and a lint-free cloth is recommended.[3]\\r\\nThe ink also acts as a coolant to protect the metal-plate heating elements ? when the ink supply is depleted, and printing is attempted, the heating elements in thermal cartridges often burn out, permanently damaging the print head. When the ink first begins to run low, the cartridge should be refilled or replaced, to avoid overheating damage to the print head.[4]\\r\\nAll Epson printers use a piezoelectric crystal in each nozzle instead of a heating element. When current is applied, the crystal changes shape or size, increasing the pressure in the ink channel and thus forcing a droplet of ink from the nozzle.[5] There are two types of crystals used: those that elongate when subjected to electricity or bi-morphs which bend. The ink channels in a piezoelectric ink jet print head can be formed using a variety of techniques, but one common method is lamination of a stack of metal plates, each of which includes precision micro-fabricated features of various shapes (i.e. containing an ink channel, orifice, reservoir and crystal). This cool environment allows use of inks which react badly when heated. For example, roughly 1/1000 of every ink jet is vaporised due to the intense heat, and ink must be designed not the clog the printer with the products of thermal decomposition. It also can make a smaller ink drop in some situations than thermal inkjet schemes.\\r\\nInk cartridges are typically priced at $13 to $75 per ounce ($1,664 to $9,600 per gallon) of ink,[6] meaning that refill cartridges sometimes cost a substantial fraction of the cost of the printer. To save money, many people use compatible ink cartridges from a vendor other than the printer manufacturer. Others use aftermarket inks, refilling their own ink cartridges using a kit that includes bulk ink. The high cost of cartridges has also provided an incentive for counterfeiters to supply cartridges falsely claiming to be made by the original manufacturer.[7] The print cartridge industry lost an estimated $3 billion in 2009 due to this, according to an International Data Corporation estimate.\\r\\nAnother alternative involves modifications of an original cartridge allowing use of continuous ink systems with external ink tanks.[8] Some manufacturers, including Canon, have introduced new models featuring in-built continuous ink systems.[9] This was seen as a welcome move by users, especially small business owners who rely on bulk-printing solutions, like Internet cafes and small-scale print shops.[10]\\r\\nSome printer manufacturers set up their cartridges to interact with the printer, preventing operation when the ink level is low, or when the cartridge has been refilled.[11] One researcher with the magazine Which? over-rode such an interlocked system and found that in one case he could print up to 38% more good quality pages, after the chip stated that the cartridge was empty.[11] In the United Kingdom, in 2003, the cost of ink has been the subject of an Office of Fair Trading investigation, as Which? magazine has accused manufacturers of a lack of transparency about the price of ink and called for an industry standard for measuring ink cartridge performance.[11] Which? stated that color HP cartridges cost over seven times more per milliliter than 1985 Dom Perignon.[11]\\r\\nIt can sometimes be cheaper to buy a new printer than to replace the set of ink cartridges supplied with the printer. The major printer manufacturers ? Hewlett Packard, Lexmark, Dell, Canon, Epson and Brother ? use a \\"razor and blades\\" [12] business model, often breaking even or losing money selling printers while expecting to make a profit by selling cartridges over the life of the printer. Since much of the printer manufacturers' profits are from ink and toner cartridge sales, some of these companies have taken various actions against aftermarket cartridges.[13]\\r\\nBecause printer cartridges from the original manufacturer are often expensive, demand exists for cheaper third party options. These include ink sold in bulk, cartridge refill kits, machines in stores that automatically refill cartridges, remanufactured cartridges, and cartridges made by an entity other than the original manufacturer.\\r\\nConsumers can refill ink cartridges themselves with a kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or remanufacturer where ink is pumped back into cartridges made up of components from previously used cartridge products. PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and color bleed.[14]\\r\\nAnother option is for the consumer to purchase \\"bulk ink\\" (in pints, quarts, or gallons) and refill the cartridges themselves. This can be extremely cost-effective if the consumer is a heavy user of cartridges, although care is required while refilling to avoid ink stains on hands, clothes, or surroundings. One US pint (437 ml) is sufficient to fill about 15 to 17 large-capacity cartridges (or 34 to 39 per liter of ink).\\r\\nGenerally speaking, Canon, Dell, HP, and Lexmark cartridges are not difficult to refill, though some Lexmark cartridges employ a built-in counter chip that can't be reset; Epson cartridges and some newer Brother cartridges also have a built-in counter chip, however it is possible to purchase a chip resetter for these models. Since older Brother cartridges generally lack any chip and consist of merely a sack of ink, they can be readily refilled.\\r\\nSome third party manufacturers have been offering refillable cartridges with an auto reset chip[15] to simplify the refilling process. These refillable cartridges are less harmful to the environment and often easy to further refill.\\r\\nPerhaps the easiest, most trouble-free method of refilling ink cartridges is through the use of a CISS (Continuous Ink Supply System). A CISS consists of a set of cartridges that have tubes connected to them, through which the ink continuously flows from ink reservoirs on the outside of the printer. Instead of refilling the cartridges themselves, the user simply refills the bottles on the outside of the printer. Early CIS systems were composed of OEM cartridges that had been drilled and outfitted with fittings to accept the ink delivery tubes, a set of 'ribbon' tubes, and plastic bottles with holes drilled in the caps for the tubes and the vents. Today's CIS systems are mass-produced in China, often incorporating all ink bottles into one partitioned container. They typically utilize auto-reset chips, which means the cartridges rarely have to be removed from the printer.\\r\\nLaser toner or inkjet cartridges sold as remanufactured are cartridges that have been reassembled with parts already in production, and refilled with new ink. Many third party newly manufactured cartridges exist, these are named compatible cartridges and refer to any cartridge that is not made by the original manufacturer of the printer. Inkjet cartridges sold as \\"compatible\\" are typically newly manufactured cartridges. Compatible and OEM cartridges can be remanufactured and refilled. Inkjet cartridges sold as \\"remanufactured\\" are cartridges that have been used at least once by a consumer and then refilled by a third party.[16]\\r\\nThe legality of this industry was brought to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the case of Lexmark Int'l v. Static Control Components. The Court ruled that reverse-engineering the handshaking procedure to enable compatibility did not violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.[17] The Supreme Court of the United States also ruled in May 2017 in Impression Products v. Lexmark that companies cannot use patent law to block reuse of products protected by patent once the product is sold, which in the case of ink cartridges, allows the sale of refurbished cartridges both within the United States and overseas.[18]\\r\\nHP has fiercely defended its printing interests from the refill industry, including filing patent complaints and false advertising lawsuits which allege that inferior ink is not properly differentiated from the original HP ink.[19]\\r\\nThe list below outlines a few facts about toner/ink cartridges and the impact they have on the environment.[20]\\r\\nMany programs have been implemented in the United States and Europe[22] to encourage the recycling of ink cartridges. New York has implemented a recycling law for businesses and consumers regarding toner and ink cartridges.[23] In California the Public Contract Code (PCC) section 12156[24] encourages businesses to purchase recycled ink and toner cartridges. In the UK, large compatible cartridge manufacturers have implemented recycling programmes in order to receive back empty cartridges for refilling of HP, Lexmark, Dell, etc. cartridges, as no compatible version is readily available.","input":"What type of ink is used in hp inkjet printers?"},{"output":"England","context":"\\r\\nSmith is a surname[3] originating in England. It is the most prevalent surname in the United Kingdom,[1] Australia and the United States,[4] the second most common surname in Canada, and the fifth most common surname in the Republic of Ireland. The surname Smith is particularly prevalent among those of English, Scottish and Irish descent,[5] but is also a common surname among African Americans, which can be attributed to black slaves being forced to adopt the name during slavery and never changing the name upon the end of the era of slavery and after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation.[6][dubious ÿ discuss] 2,376,206 Americans shared the surname Smith during the 2000 census,[7] and more than 500,000 people share it in the United Kingdom.[8] At the turn of the 20th century, the surname was sufficiently prevalent in England to have prompted the statement: \\"Common to every village in England, north, south, east and west\\";[9] and sufficiently common on the (European) continent (in various forms) to be \\"common in most countries of Europe\\".[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name refers to a smith, originally deriving from smie or smit, the Old English term meaning one who works in metal related to the word smitan, the Old English form of smite, which also meant strike (as in early 17th century Biblical English: the verb \\"to smite\\" = to hit). The Old English word smit comes from the Proto-Germanic word smitaz. Smithy comes from the Old English word smie from the Proto-Germanic smiejon. The use of Smith as an occupational surname dates back to Anglo-Saxon times, when inherited surnames were still unknown: Ecceard Smith of County Durham, North East England, was recorded in 975.[11]\\r\\nAlthough the name is derived from a common occupation, many later Smiths had no connection to that occupation, but adopted or were given the surname precisely because of its commonness. For example:\\r\\nA popular misconception holds that at the beginning of the 20th century, when many new immigrants were entering the U.S., civil servants at Ellis Island responsible for cataloging the entry of such persons sometimes arbitrarily assigned new surnames if the immigrants' original surname was particularly lengthy, or difficult for the processor to spell or pronounce.[citation needed] While such claims are likely vastly exaggerated,[12] many immigrants did choose to begin their American lives with more \\"American\\" names, particularly with Anglicised versions of their birth names; the German Schmidt was often Anglicized to Smith not only during the world wars, but also commonly in times of peace, and the equivalent Polish Kowalski was Anglicized to Smith as well.\\r\\nVariations of the surname Smith also remain very common. These include different spellings of the English term, and versions in other languages.\\r\\nThere is some disagreement about the origins of the numerous variations of the name Smith. The addition of an e at the end of the name is sometimes considered an affectation, but may have arisen either as an attempt to spell smithy or as the Middle English adjectival form of smith,[13] which would have been used in surnames based on location rather than occupation (in other words, for someone living near or at the smithy).[14] Likewise, the replacement of the i with a y in Smyth or Smythe is also often considered an affectation but may have originally occurred because of the difficulty of reading blackletter text, where Smith might look like Snuth or Simth.[13] However, Charles Bardsley wrote in 1901, \\"The y in Smyth is the almost invariable spelling in early rolls, so that it cannot exactly be styled a modern affectation.\\"[9] Some variants (such as Smijth) were adopted by individuals for personal reasons, while others may have arisen independently or as offshoots from the Smith root. Names such as Smither and Smithers may in some cases be variants of Smith but in others independent surnames based on a meaning of light and active attributed to smyther.[14] Additional derivatives include Smithman, Smithson and Smithfield (see below).[14] Athersmith may derive from at the Smith.[15]\\r\\nOther variations focus on specialisms within the profession; for example Blacksmith, from those who worked predominantly with iron, Whitesmith, from those who worked with tin (and the more obvious Tinsmith), Brownsmith and Redsmith, from those who worked with copper (Coppersmith and Greensmith; copper is green when oxidised), Silversmith and Goldsmith ÿ and those based on the goods produced, such as Hammersmith, Bladesmith, Naismith (nail-smith), Arrowsmith which in turn was shortened to Arsmith,[16] or Shoesmith (referring to horseshoes).[14] Sixsmith is variant spelling of a sickle- or scythe-smith.[17] Wildsmith in turn is a corruption of wheelsmith[18]\\r\\nThe patronymic practice of attaching son to the end of a name to indicate that the bearer is the child of the original holder has also led to the surnames Smithson and Smisson.\\r\\nOther languages with different words for the occupation of \\"smith\\" or \\"blacksmith\\" also produced surnames based on that root.\\r\\nWords derived from the Latin term for smith (literally \\"one who works with iron\\"), such as the Italian words fabbro and ferraio, are the root of last names common in several parts of Europe.[citation needed]\\r\\nIn Ireland and Scotland, the word for smith, gobha, is found in the surname \\"MacGouren\\"/MacGouran/MacGowan/McGowan. This surname is an Anglicised form of Mac a' Ghobhainn (Scottish Gaelic), Mac Gabhann (Irish), meaning \\"son of the smith\\".[19] In England the surname Goff, which is common in East Anglia, is derived from the Breton and Cornish goff a cognate of the Gaelic gobha. This particular surname was brought to England by migrant Bretons, following the Norman Conquest of England.[20]","input":"What is the origin of the surname smith?"},{"output":"Jyotirao Phule","context":"Satyashodhak Samaj (Truth-seekers' Society) is a social reform society founded by Jyotirao Phule in Pune, India, on 24 September 1873. Its purpose was to liberate the less privileged in the then prevailing society such as women,Shudra, and Dalit from exploitation and oppression.[1][2]\\r\\nPhule established Satyashodhak Samaj with the ideals of human well-being, happiness, unity, equality, and easy religious principles and rituals.[2] A Pune-based newspaper, Deenbandhu, provided the voice for the views of the Samaj.[3]\\r\\nThe membership of the samaj included Muslims, Brahmans, and government officials.However,Non-Brahman castes dominated.Phule's own Mali caste provided the leading members and financial supporters for the organization.[1]\\r\\nThe non-Brahmin movement, that was embodied in Satyashodhak Samaj, had not made much difference to any sections of the society in the 19th century and languished after the death of Phule. However, it was revived in the early 20th century by the Maratha ruler of the princely state of Kolhapur, Shahu Maharaj. In 1902, Shahu reserved 50 per cent civil service posts in Kolhapur state for all communities other than Brahmins, Prabhus[a] and Parsi. He also sponsored religious ceremonies that did not need a brahmin priest to officiate.[5] By the 1920s, the samaj had established strong roots among the rural masses in Western Maharashtra and Vidarbha and took a strong economic overtone in its message. At that time the organization styled itself the representative of the Bahujan samaj. It also defined the brahmins,merchants and moneylenders as the oppressors of the masses.[6]The Samaj also conducted activities in Satara District, Kolhapur State and other places in this area that were designed to harass Brahmins, and to drive them from their positions as priests, government officials, money-lenders, and teachers in the rural areas.[7] Prior to 1920s,the samaj opposed the Indian national movement because it was a movement led by the elites. Later followers of the Samaj during 20th century included educationalist Bhaurao Patil and Maratha leaders such as Keshavrao Jedhe, Nana Patil, Khanderao Bagal and Madhavrao Bagal.[8].By the 1930s,given the mass movement nature of the Congress party under Mahatma Gandhi,the samaj leaders such as Jedhe joined the Congress, and the samaj activities withered away.[9]\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nCitations","input":"Who was the founder of satya shodhak samaj?"},{"output":"the supporters","context":"","input":"Who is the owner of barcelona f c?"},{"output":"20-second","context":"In sports, a time-out or timeout is a halt in the play. This allows the coaches of either team to communicate with the team, e.g., to determine strategy or inspire morale, as well as to stop the game clock. Time-outs are usually called by coaches or players, although for some sports, TV timeouts are called to allow media to air commercial breaks. Teams usually call timeouts at strategically important points in the match, or to avoid the team being called for a delay of game-type violation, such as the five-second rule in basketball.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBaseball players and managers of both the offense and defense, as well as umpires, can request time out for a number of purposes, such as for a batter to step out of the batter's box to better prepare for a pitch, to replace a worn ball, for a manager to speak with a player or umpire or to replace one player with another (for which a time-out is required by the rules), etc. The requested time out is not effective unless an umpire grants it verbally or by hand signal (both hands raised). Since there is no clock in baseball, the main effect of a time out is to temporarily prevent the defensive team from tagging base runners out or delivering a pitch as well as to prevent base runners from advancing. However, the catcher may also request timeout once the pitcher has stepped on the rubber; usually with the intention of either \\"resetting\\" the play, or to deliver some information to the pitcher via either signals or a visit to the mound. Under certain (uncommon) circumstances specified by the rules, umpires are required to call time out, even while a play is in progress, such as certain cases of interference. Unlike many other sports, the rules of baseball do not limit time outs, either by number or duration. The end of the time out is indicated by an umpire verbally declaring \\"Play!\\" and/or by pointing at the pitcher while he is holding the ball (these umpire signals are identical to those used to start a game or resume play after the ball has become \\"dead,\\" for example due to a half-inning ending). Since baseball provides natural breaks in the action when teams exchange offensive and defensive roles between half-innings (two minutes, five seconds normally; two minutes and twenty-five seconds for nationally televised games[1]), TV timeouts are not necessary.\\r\\nOther than coaching visits, which the umpires ensure stay brief, timeouts theoretically have no time limits. However, when no runners occupy a base, a pitcher must deliver the pitch within twelve seconds of receiving the ball from the catcher or else a \\"delay of game\\" is called, resulting in a ball.[2] Also, any relief pitcher is limited to eight warm-up throws before play resumes, except in special circumstances (such as a pitcher substitution due to injury).\\r\\nThough not officially recognized as a \\"timeout,\\" a stoppage in play can also be requested by the defense. This can be accomplished in several ways. First, once in his \\"set\\" position, the pitcher may stop play by stepping off the rubber prior to his windup. Secondly, the catcher may visit the pitcher at any point before he steps on the rubber. Finally, the manager or pitching coach may also visit the pitcher before he steps on the rubber (called a \\"coaching visit\\"). Under MLB rules, a team is limited to one visit per inning and a maximum of three per game. Under NFHS (high school) rules, a team receives three mound visits for the game and can use more than one an inning. If a team exceeds the limit in either MLB or high school ball, the pitcher must be removed immediately.\\r\\nIn American college basketball, there are two systems of timeouts used. In games that are not broadcast, each team is allowed four 75-second and two 30-second timeouts per regulation game. In games which are being broadcast, as of the 2015-16 season, each team is granted one 60-second timeout and three 30-second timeouts per game in addition to the media timeouts (at the first dead ball under 16, 12, 8 and 4 minutes remaining in each half). A maximum of three 30-second timeouts may carry over into the second half. Any called timeout that occurs within the 30 seconds prior to a scheduled media timeout break automatically takes the place of the upcoming media timeout, with the only exception to this rule being the first called timeout of the second half. A timeout cannot be called by a coach when the ball is live. Previously, under NCAA rules in prior seasons, teams had a total of five timeouts, and timeouts superseding media timeouts were only used in the women's rules.[3]\\r\\nHigh school basketball allots five timeouts per game, with three 60-second and two 30-second timeouts. In overtime games, each team is given one additional 60-second timeout, and is allowed to carry over any unused timeouts from regulation or ÿ if the case may be ÿ previous overtimes. Media timeouts are typically reserved for televised state tournament games only.\\r\\nIn the North American National Basketball Association, the rule on timeouts is more complex. Teams are allowed one 20-second timeout per half, and six regular timeouts, of one minute in length over the course of the entire game. During a 20-second timeout, only one player may be substituted. During a regular timeout, there is no limit on substitutions. In the first and third quarter, there must be two 100-second timeouts. If neither team has taken a timeout prior to 6:00 of the first or third period, the Official Scorer must take it at the first dead ball and charge it to the home team. If no subsequent timeouts are taken prior to 3:00, the Official Scorer must take it and charge it to the team not previously charged. In the second and fourth quarter, there must be three 100-second timeouts. If neither team has taken a timeout prior to 9:00 of the second or fourth period, a mandatory timeout is called by the Official Scorer and charged to neither team. If there are no subsequent timeouts taken prior to 6:00, the Official Scorer must take it at the first dead ball and charge it to the home team. If no subsequent timeouts are taken prior to 3:00, the Official Scorer must take it and charge it to the team not previously charged. In the fourth quarter, each team is limited to a maximum of three timeouts and if a team has two or three full timeouts remaining when the fourth period reaches the 2:00 mark, one of the timeouts will be changed to a 20-second timeout and it will retain one full timeout. In overtime periods, each team shall be allowed two 60-second timeouts and one 20-second timeout. If a team has two full timeouts remaining when the overtime period reaches the 2:00 mark, one of the timeouts will be changed to a 20-second timeout.\\r\\nThe Official Scorer notifies a team when it has been charged with a mandatory timeout. Additional timeouts in a period, beyond those that are mandatory, are for 60 seconds.\\r\\nIn beach volleyball, the Fdration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) stipulates one 30-second time-out allowed per team, per set. In FIVB World Competitions, there is an additional 30-second technical time-out in sets 1-2 when the sum of both scores is equal to 21.[4]\\r\\nDuring the 2009 season of the Indian Premier League of T20 cricket, the halfway point of each innings contained a seven-and-a-half minute television timeout, two-thirds of which were devoted to additional advertising time. After complaints by viewers and players (criticizing its commercial purpose and for breaking the flow of the game), the following season replaced them with two sponsored and compulsory two-and-a-half minute \\"strategic timeouts\\" that must be taken by each side at certain points during the innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between the 6th to 10th overs, and the batting team between the 11th to 16th overs.[5][6][7]\\r\\nIn floorball, each team is allowed one thirty-second time-out per game, which may only be taken during a normal stoppage of play. The time-out is measured from when all the players are gathered around the team benches.\\r\\nIn gridiron football, the use and rationing of time-outs is a major part of strategy; calling time-out stops the clock (which normally is running between plays except in the case of a penalty, an incomplete pass, officials requiring time to re-spot the ball and/or down markers, or when the ball is run out of bounds), extending the time a team has to score. Timeouts can be called by both players (typically the quarterback or a linebacker) and the head coach. The number of timeouts is limited to three per team per half in the National Football League, and college and high school levels; to two per half in amateur Canadian football, and to one per half in the Canadian Football League. Unused timeouts carry over between the first and second quarters and between the third and fourth quarters, but they do not carry over between halves. If overtime is required in the NFL, each team is given two timeouts during a fifteen-minute sudden-death period, while in college football each team gets one timeout per possession. If a timeout above these limits is called, it is usually ignored and no penalty is assessed (however, in many leagues, a coach attempting to call a timeout when he has no timeouts left can be assessed a 5-yard Delay Of Game penalty).\\r\\nTeams use several methods to stop the clock without exhausting a timeout. These include:\\r\\nIn the NFL, college football, and CFL, a timeout is assessed against a team if a head coach unsuccessfully challenges a play.\\r\\nA common practice in gridiron football is to call a timeout right before a potential game-winning or game-tying field goal, a strategy known as \\"icing the kicker.\\" In theory, this strategy works because the kicker has prepared himself mentally to make the kick only to have the timeout break his concentration. While this strategy has seemingly worked on occasion, statistics suggest that not only is this an ineffective strategy, but is actually counterproductive because kickers are more likely to make a field goal after a timeout is calledpossibly because they have come to expect a timeout to be called, if the opposing team still has one.[8] There have also been times when the tactic has directly backfired; for example, in an NFL game played on November 19, 2007, between the Denver Broncos and Tennessee Titans, Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan called a timeout to ice the kicker. It was difficult to hear the whistle and the play continued, with Titans kicker Rob Bironas badly shanking a 56-yard field goal. The play was restarted, this time without a timeout, and the kick was good. Since a team is not allowed to call multiple timeouts between plays, they are prohibited from trying to ice a kicker more than once on the same kick; attempting to do so results in an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, giving the kicking team 15 yards and an automatic first down. It has only happened once in the NFL, in a 2007 game between the Buffalo Bills and the Washington Redskins, when Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs called a timeout just before Bills kicker Rian Lindell attempted a 51-yard field goal. The kick was good, but Gibbs was awarded the timeout. Gibbs then called a second timeout when Lindell was preparing to kick the ball again, because Gibbs was unaware of the rule. Gibbs was issued an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, which narrowed the attempt from 51 yards to 36 yards out. Lindell made the 36-yard field goal to win the game for the Bills, 18ÿ17.\\r\\nAnother common practice, particularly in high school, college and the NFL, is for a team that, with its defense on the field, is trailing the opposing team near the end of the regulation by a touchdown or less to use their time outs when the winning team is using the victory formation to run out the clock. Since winning teams using the quarterback kneel can run off the last 90 seconds to 2 minutes of a game (depending on the level) with three successive kneels, the losing team will call a time out to stop the clock, force the winning team to run a standard play (as only a few seconds are taken off the clock with the kneel itself, the clock restarting only upon the snap) or make a first down and thus increase the chances that the trailing team will get the ball back on offense.\\r\\nIn ice hockey, each team is allowed one thirty-second time-out per game, which may only be taken during a normal stoppage of play. In the National Hockey League, only one team is permitted a time out during stoppage. However, in the International Ice Hockey Federation rules, both teams are permitted a time out during the same stoppage, but the second team must notify the referee before the opponent's time-out expires.\\r\\nIn the NHL, teams lose their time-out if they unsuccessfully challenge a goal, and cannot challenge if they are already without their time-out.\\r\\nIn team handball, one sixty-second time-out per half per team is allowed. Time-outs are called by the head coach by handing a green time-out card to the match official, and can only be called when the team is in possession of the ball.\\r\\nIn volleyball, the Fdration Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) stipulates two 30-second time-outs allowed per team, per set. In FIVB World and Official Competitions, there are two additional 60-second technical time-outs in each set when the leading team reaches the 8th and 16th points, however there is no technical time-out in a tie-breaking set (5th set) (though there is a change of ends at 8 points).[9]\\r\\nIn water polo, each team is entitled two sixty-second time-outs in regular time, and one extra time-out in extra time.

Among its varied efforts to offer material help to the poor or needy, the Society also has thrift stores which sell donated goods at a low price and raise money for the poor.[5] There are a great variety of outreach programs sponsored by the local conferences and councils, addressing local needs for social services.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in 1833 to help impoverished people living in the slums of Paris, France.[6] The primary figure behind the Society's founding was Blessed Frdric Ozanam, a French lawyer, author, and professor in the Sorbonne. Frdric collaborated with Emmanuel Bailly, editor of the Tribune Catholique, in reviving a student organization which had been suspended during the revolutionary activity of July 1830. Ozanam was 20 years old when he founded the Society.[7] He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1997.[8] Emmanuel Bailly was chosen as the first President.\\r\\nThe Society took Saint Vincent de Paul as its patron under the influence of Sister Rosalie Rendu, DC. Sister Rosalie, beatified in November 1999 by Pope John Paul II, was a member of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, earlier known for her work with people in the slums of Paris. She guided Frdric and his companions in their approach towards those in need.[9]\\r\\nSVP gradually expanded outside Paris in the mid-19th century and received benefactors in places such as Tours where figures such as the Venerable Leo Dupont, known as the Holy Man of Tours, became collaborators.[10]\\r\\nThe Society is part of the Vincentian Family which also includes two congregations founded by St. Vincent de Paul ÿ the Congregation of the Mission with Vincentian priests and brothers and the Ladies of Charity ÿ along with the Sisters of Charity in the Setonian tradition and several others, including some religious groups that are part of the Anglican Communion like the Company of Mission Priests.[9][1]\\r\\nServant of God Fr. Ignatius Spencer from London came to know the Society in visits to Paris. Parisian Monsieur Baudon, who would assume the presidency of SVDP in 1847, visited London in 1842 and persuaded Spencer to write about the Society in the Catholic Magazine. Then in January 1844 M. Pagliano, a London restaurateur and recent convert to Catholicism, gathered 13 Catholic men and the first English SVP conference was founded.[11] Early initiatives included the formation of the Catholic Shoe Black Brigade, providing boys with gainful employment and the first home of the Rescue Society which under various names still offers child care in many dioceses.[12]\\r\\nIn 2013 there were more than 10,000 members in more than 1,000 Conferences in the United Kingdom, making over 500,000 recorded visits annually to more than 100,000 people.[12]\\r\\nThe Societys first Conference in the United States was established in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, at the Basilica of St. Louis King of France, or \\"Old Cathedral\\". Fr. John Timon, CM, had learned of the Society while visiting with his Vincentian superiors in Paris. From Dublin, Ireland, he brought to St. Louis copies of the SVP Rule. On November 16, 1845, Bishop Peter Richard Kenrick dedicated the new St. Vincent de Paul church on South Eighth Street and invited Timon to preach. Timon discussed the Society in his sermon,[13] in the presence of prominent laymen who took hold of the idea and held an organizational meeting on November 20, 1845. The Conference included Dr. Moses Linton, founder of the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, and as chair Judge Bryan Mullanphy who would become mayor of St. Louis.[14][15] Bishop Kenrick appointed Fr. Ambrose Heim as spiritual advisor to the Conference.[16]\\r\\nFather Gerald Ward was born in London in 1806 and was recruited for the Melbourne mission by the pioneering father, later bishop, Patrick Geoghegan. Ward was familiar with SVP from London and, observing the plight of the poor after the Victorian gold rush, established the Society in Australia in 1854. Ward served as its first president and helped establish the SVP orphanage in South Melbourne.[17] Charles O'Neill, an engineer and parliamentarian who had led the Society in Scotland, established it in Sydney.\\r\\nFr. Chataigner, SM, established the first Conference in New Zealand in July 1867, but did not affiliate with the Council-General in Paris. The first to affiliate was the Wellington Conference founded in 1908 by Fr. Petitjean, SM, and Charles O'Neill, followed by other Conferences out of Wellington.[18][19]\\r\\nCharles Gordon O'Neill was born in Glasgow in 1828. He graduated as a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Upon graduation he had joined the Society of St Vincent de Paul. He was secretary at Dumbarton in 1851. He led the St Vincent de Paul Society in the Western Districts of Scotland between 1859 and 1863. By 1863 he was president of the Superior Council of Glasgow and a member of the Council-General in Paris.[20]\\r\\nSVP came to Mumbai in 1862 when the Conference of Our Lady of Hope, Bhuleshwar, was established at the cathedral by the future bishop Fr. Leo Meurin, S.J. With the closure of the cathedral in 1942, the Conference was transferred to the Church of Our Lady of Health, Cavel. Meurin also established a Conference at St. Teresa, Girgaum, in 1862, and four more in Mumbai in 1863: St. Peter, Bandra; St. Joseph, Umarkhadi; Our Lady of Victories, Mahim; and St. Anne, Mazagaon.[21] The Society is active in southern India, especially through the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church headquartered in Kerala.\\r\\nThe Society numbers about 800,000 members in some 140 countries worldwide, whose members operate through \\"conferences\\".[4] A Conference may be based out of a church, school, community center, hospital, etc., and is composed of Catholic volunteers who pursue their own Christian growth in the service of the poor. Some Conferences exist without affiliating with any local Council, and so are not counted in statistics. Non-Catholics may join and the Society serves all regardless of their personal beliefs.[4]\\r\\nThe Society of St. Vincent de Paul was founded in Ireland in 1844 when it was part of the United Kingdom. It is the largest voluntary charitable organisation in Ireland. During its history it has helped people in need through a famine, a civil war, a war of independence, two world wars, and several economic recessions. It is one of Ireland's best known and most widely supported organisations of social concern and action with over 11,500 volunteers, active in every county in Ireland.[22]\\r\\nIn Australia the \\"Vinnies\\" number about 58,000.[23] Works include Conferences, Special Works, and Vinnies shops,[24] assisting over 2,200,000 people in Australia each year.[25]\\r\\nIn New Zealand, SVP operates in 23 regions with over 50 shops which serve as centres for welfare service, including food banks and food trucks. Most Catholic schools have Young Vinnies who help with fundraising and with training for dealing directly with the poor. The work is varied, following the Vinnie motto: \\"No act of charity is foreign to the society.\\"[26]\\r\\nThe national headquarters is in St. Louis. Membership in the United States in 2015 exceeded 97,000 in 4,400 communities. Expenditures to people in poverty were $473,821,563. Programs include visits to homes, prisons, and hospitals, housing assistance, disaster relief, job training and placement, food pantries, dining halls, clothing, transportation and utility costs, care for the elderly, and medicine.[27] Revenue is raised through a large network of thrift stores.[28]\\r\\nThe first Conference of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul in Monaco was created in 1876. The Conference of the immaculate Conception of Monaco-City whose commemorative plaque is on the Place de la Visitation, thanks among others to Monsieur Thheuret, Apostolic Protonotary in Monaco and to Mr Gastaldi, Mayor of Monaco. Mr. Theuret was appointed first Honorary President. The Vice-President of Honor being the Marquis de la Riva, first Chambellan of the Sovereign Prince.\\r\\nThe first active President was Lieutenant Plati. The Sovereign Prince, Prince Charles III, was one of the first benefactors. At the time, the Immaculate Conception Conference was attached to the Particular Council of the Nice Conferences.\\r\\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society in Monaco is located on 32 Rue Grimaldi, in the Condamine neighbourhood.\\r\\nThe St. Vincent de Paul Society runs thrift stores in many countries including Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada, as seen from websites for some in the US: St. Louis area with 7 such stores,[29] Cincinnati area with 7,[30] Omaha with 3,[31] Dayton with 2,[32] Des Moines with 2,[33] Florida with 35,[34] California with 26,[34] Pennsylvania with 24,[28] Western Oregon with 15,[28] Georgia with 12,[28] Arizona with 10,[35] and Idaho with 3.[36] Items from clothing to automobiles are sold for a small price, often with home pick-up for large items.

He was selected in the second round of the 1984 NFL draft by the Chicago Bears, and was a backup on the 1985 team which won Super Bowl XX.\\r\\nAs a coach, Rivera was the defensive coordinator for Bears in the 2006, who were NFC champions and competed in Super Bowl XLI. In 2011, he was named head coach of the Carolina Panthers. Rivera was recognized as the NFL Coach of the Year by the Associated Press in 2013 and in 2015.[2] Since taking over the Panthers, he has led the team to three straight divisional titles, and an appearance in Super Bowl 50.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRivera was granted a football scholarship to California, where he was a consensus All-American linebacker, leading the Golden Bears in tackles for his last three years as a player. He once held Cal's all-time sack and career tackles records, and still holds the record for most tackles for loss in a season, set in 1983. Rivera was the MVP of the 1984 East-West Shrine Game.[3]\\r\\nIn the 1984 NFL draft, Rivera was selected in the second round by the Chicago Bears. During the 1985 season, he played in Super Bowl XX, where the Bears routed the New England Patriots, 46ÿ10. Rivera was the first Mexican/Puerto Rican to play on a Super Bowl championship team. He became the starter in 1988, serving for three seasons. Rivera played for the Bears for a total of nine seasons (1984ÿ1992).[4]\\r\\nIn 1993, Rivera went to work for WGN-TV and SportsChannel Chicago as a TV analyst covering the Bears and college football. In 1996, he became a defense quality control coach for the Bears.\\r\\nIn 1999, Rivera was named linebackers coach for the Philadelphia Eagles. During his tenure, the Eagles advanced to the NFC championship for three consecutive seasons. He is credited with developing linebacker Jeremiah Trotter into a two-time Pro Bowl performer.\\r\\nOn January 23, 2004, Rivera was named defensive coordinator of the Bears. In 2005, the Bears defense was rated second-best in the NFL.[5] The Bears qualified for the NFC playoffs, losing in the second round to the Carolina Panthers, 29ÿ21. The 2005 performance of the Chicago Bears earned him consideration for Head Coach assignments from several NFL teams.\\r\\nIn 2006, the Bears' defensive efforts failed to match the success of their 2005 season. Nevertheless, the team was still a notable presence in league, finishing with the league's third ranked and conference's top-ranked points allowed category.[5] The defense's success earned Rivera recognition among franchises looking for new head coaches. The Arizona Cardinals and Pittsburgh Steelers interviewed him in January 2007. He was a candidate for the vacant Dallas Cowboys head coaching position, a job that ultimately went to San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Rivera was named as a potential candidate to replace the fired Marty Schottenheimer in San Diego, but the job was filled by Norv Turner, the brother of fellow offensive coordinator, Ron Turner, Rivera's offensive counterpart in Chicago.[6][7][8] After the announcement, ESPN reported that the Bears were considering letting Rivera go. This came after several other teams interviewed him, and the negotiations between his representatives and the Bears were making little progress.[9] On February 19, 2007, it was announced that Ron Rivera's contract with the Bears would not be renewed.[10]\\r\\nThe San Diego Chargers hired Rivera as team's inside linebackers coach after he left the Bears.[11] On October 28, 2008, Rivera was promoted to defensive coordinator with the Chargers after the team released former defensive coordinator Ted Cottrell.[12] Rivera had used the 4ÿ3 defense for most of his coaching career, but adopted a 3ÿ4 scheme with the Chargers.\\r\\nOn January 11, 2011, Rivera was named the fourth head coach of the Carolina Panthers. He is the fifth Latino to be an NFL head coach, following former New Orleans Saints coach Tom Fears, former Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks coach Tom Flores, former New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts coach Jim E. Mora, and former Atlanta Falcons coach Jim L. Mora.\\r\\nDuring his first year as head coach, the Panthers went 6ÿ10 and finished third in the division. In 2012, the Panthers finished 7ÿ9 and finished second in the division. Following the 2012 season, Rivera was expected to be fired.[13]\\r\\nOver the first 34 games of his coaching career, Rivera was known for exceptionally conservative decision-making that led to a 2ÿ14 record in games decided by less than a touchdown. Against the Buffalo Bills in Week 2, Rivera decided to kick a field goal while up 3 points and facing a fourth and one deep inside the Bills territory late in the fourth quarter. The Bills proceeded to drive for a touchdown on their next drive, scoring on a touchdown pass with less than 20 seconds remaining in the game.[14] With Carolina opening the 2013 season 0ÿ2, reports circled that the front office was already performing background checks on new potential head coach candidates. Rivera then changed his coaching philosophy and became a more aggressive coach.[14] Facing a 4th and 1 from the two yard line in the first quarter against the also 0ÿ2 New York Giants in Week 3, Rivera went for the touchdown instead of a field goal. A Mike Tolbert run found the end zone, and Carolina ended up winning the game 38ÿ0.[14]\\r\\nOver the next five games, the Panthers went for a first down five times in situations where conventional strategy called for a field goal attempt. They converted on four of them and ended each of those drives with touchdowns, all in wins. The lone failure was against the Cardinals when Brandon LaFell dropped a wide open pass across the middle from Cam Newton that would have resulted in a sure touchdown as well. This sudden aggression in his play-calling earned Rivera the nickname \\"Riverboat Ron\\", after Riverboat gamblers.[15] Rivera has expressed discontent with the nickname, however, explaining he is \\"a calculated risk taker\\" not a gambler.[16] He has since reverted to his conservative nature now that his job is no longer in jeopardy; his Twitter nickname is \\"RiverboatRonHC.\\" The Panthers went 11ÿ1 to finish the season, including a then-franchise record eight-game winning streak, to win the NFC South title and make the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Rivera was honored as the 2013 AP NFL Coach of the Year.\\r\\nIn Rivera's fourth season as the Panthers' coach, Carolina recovered from a 3ÿ8ÿ1 start to win its final four regular season games and clinch the NFC South championship for the second consecutive year. The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27ÿ16 in the NFC Wild Card playoff game for the team's first playoff win since 2005.\\r\\nThe team's momentum would continue in 2015. The Panthers produced the best season in franchise history, and one of the best regular seasons in NFL history. The Panthers started the season 14ÿ0, the best regular-season start in franchise history. They ultimately finished 15ÿ1 (their only loss was in week 16 in Atlanta, a 20ÿ13 defeat by the Falcons), a franchise record for wins in a season, to clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. They defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Divisional Playoffs by a score of 31ÿ24, and routed the Arizona Cardinals with a 49ÿ15 victory in the NFC Championship Game, leading the Panthers to their second Super Bowl appearance. Rivera is the fifth man of color to lead a team to the Super Bowl. He was also recognized as the 2015 AP NFL Coach of the Year; his second such honor of his career. On February 7, 2016, Rivera coached the Panthers in Super Bowl 50. The Panthers fell to the Denver Broncos by a score of 24ÿ10.[17]\\r\\nDespite reaching the playoffs three years in a row from 2013ÿ2015, Rivera has been unable to produce back-to-back winning seasons as a head coach.\\r\\nRivera has two children, a son, Christopher, and daughter, Courtney, with his wife, Stephanie, who is a former assistant coach for the WNBA's Washington Mystics.[18][19] In 2003, Rivera was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Cal (University of California, Berkeley) Sports Hall of Fame in 1994.[20] On January 5, 2015, Rivera's home in Charlotte, North Carolina, caught on fire. Everyone escaped the house without injuries.[21] On July 28, 2015, Rivera's brother Mickey died after a two-year battle with cancer.[22]","input":"Who is the coach of the carolina panthers?"},{"output":"North West England","context":"The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or fells) and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets, Beatrix Potter, and John Ruskin. A National Park was established in 1951 and, following a minor extension in 2016, now covers an area of approximately 2,362 square kilometres.[2] It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2017.[3]\\r\\nIt is located entirely within the county of Cumbria, and all the land in England higher than 3,000 feet (914?m) above sea level lies within the National Park, including Scafell Pike, the highest mountain in England. It also contains the deepest and longest bodies of water in England, respectively Wast Water and Windermere.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lake District National Park includes all of the central Lake District, though the town of Kendal, some coastal areas, and the Lakeland Peninsulas (sometimes included as part of the Lake District) are currently outside the park boundary.\\r\\nThe area was designated a national park on 9 May 1951 (less than a month after the first UK national park designation  the Peak District). It retained its original boundaries until 2016 when it was extended by 3% in the direction of the Yorkshire Dales National Park to incorporate areas such as land of high landscape value in the Lune Valley.[4]\\r\\nIt is the most visited national park in the United Kingdom with 15.8?million annual visitors and more than 23?million annual day visits,[1] the largest of the thirteen national parks in England and Wales, and the second largest in the UK after the Cairngorms.[5] Its aim is to protect the landscape by restricting unwelcome change by industry or commerce. Most of the land in the park is in private ownership, with about 55% registered as agricultural land. Landowners include:\\r\\nThe National Park Authority is based at offices in Kendal. It runs a visitor centre on Windermere at a former country house called Brockhole,[8] Coniston Boating Centre,[9] and Information Centres. It is reducing its landholding.[10]\\r\\nIn common with all other national parks in England, there is no restriction on entry to, or movement within the park along public routes, but access to cultivated land is usually restricted to public footpaths, bridleways and byways. Much of the uncultivated land has statutory open access rights, which cover around 50% of the park.\\r\\nThe lakes and mountains combine to form impressive scenery. Farmland and settlement have altered the natural scenery, and the ecology has been modified by human influence for millennia and includes important wildlife habitats. Having failed in a previous attempt to gain World Heritage status as a natural World Heritage Site, because of human activities, it was eventually successful in the category of cultural landscape and was awarded the status in 2017.[3]\\r\\nThe precise extent of the Lake District was not defined traditionally, but is slightly larger than that of the National Park[citation needed], the total area of which is about 912 square miles (2,362?km2).[11] The park extends just over 32 miles (51?km) from east to west and nearly 40 miles (64?km) from north to south,[12] with areas such as the Lake District Peninsulas to the south lying outside the National Park.[13]\\r\\nThe Lake District is one of the most highly populated national parks. There are, however, only a handful of major settlements within this mountainous area, the towns of Keswick, Windermere, Ambleside, and Bowness-on-Windermere being the four largest. Significant towns immediately outside the boundary of the national park include Millom, Barrow-in-Furness, Kendal, Ulverston, Cockermouth, Penrith, and Grange-over-Sands; each of these has important economic links with the area. Villages such as Coniston, Threlkeld, Glenridding, Pooley Bridge, Broughton-in-Furness, Grasmere, Newby Bridge, Staveley, Lindale, Gosforth and Hawkshead are more local centres. The economies of almost all are intimately linked with tourism. Beyond these are a scattering of hamlets and many isolated farmsteads, some of which are still tied to agriculture; others now function as part of the tourist economy.[14]\\r\\nThe Lake District National Park is almost contained within a box of trunk routes. It is flanked to the east by the A6 road which runs from Kendal to Penrith (though the extension approved in 2015 will be east of the A6). The A590 which connects the M6 to Barrow-in-Furness, and the A5092 trunk roads cut across its southern fringes and the A66 trunk road between Penrith and Workington cuts across its northern edge. Finally the A595 trunk road runs through the coastal plains to the west of the area linking the A66 with the A5092.\\r\\nBesides these, a few A roads penetrate the area itself, notably the A591 which runs north westwards from Kendal to Windermere and then on to Keswick. It continues up the east side of Bassenthwaite Lake. \\"The A591, Grasmere, Lake District\\" was short-listed in the 2011 Google Street View awards in the Most Romantic Street category. The A593 and A5084 link the Ambleside and Coniston areas with the A590 to the south whilst the A592 and A5074 similarly link Windermere with the A590. The A592 also continues northwards from Windermere to Ullswater and Penrith by way of the Kirkstone Pass.\\r\\nSome valleys which are not penetrated by A roads are served by B roads. The B5289 serves Lorton Vale and Buttermere and links via the Honister Pass with Borrowdale. The B5292 ascends the Whinlatter Pass from Lorton Vale before dropping down to Braithwaite near Keswick. The B5322 serves the valley of St John's in the Vale whilst Great Langdale is served by the B5343. Other valleys such as Little Langdale, Eskdale and Dunnerdale are served by minor roads. The last of these is connected with the first two by the Wrynose and Hardknott passes respectively; both of these passes are known for their steep gradients and are together one of the most popular climbs in the United Kingdom for cycling enthusiasts.[15] A minor road through the Newlands Valley connects via Newlands Hause with the B5289 at Buttermere. Wasdale is served by a cul-de-sac minor road, as are Longsleddale and the valleys at Haweswater and Kentmere. There are networks of minor roads in the lower-lying southern part of the area, connecting numerous communities between Kendal, Windermere and Coniston.[14]\\r\\nThe West Coast Main Line skirts the eastern edge of the Lake District and the Cumbrian Coast Line passes through the southern and western fringes of the area. A single railway line, the Windermere Branch Line, penetrates from Kendal to Windermere via Staveley. Railways once served Broughton-in-Furness and Coniston (closed to passengers in 1958) and another ran from Penrith to Cockermouth via Keswick (closed west of Keswick in 1966 and completely in 1972). Part of the track of the latter is used by the improved A66 trunk road.\\r\\nThe Cumbrian Coast line has three stations within the boundaries of the national park (and additionally Drigg, within sight of the park boundary). The line gives railway enthusiasts and others a flavour of a pre-Beeching railway line, with features like manually operated level crossing gates, as well as giving a good connection to the steam railway into Eskdale and providing access for cyclists and serious walkers to the Western Fells.[16]\\r\\nThe narrow gauge Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway runs from Ravenglass on the west coast up Eskdale as far as Dalegarth Station near the hamlet of Boot, catering for tourists. Another heritage railway, the Lakeside and Haverthwaite Railway, runs between Lake Windermere and Haverthwaite, and tourists can connect at Lakeside with the boats up the lake to Bowness.\\r\\nA vehicle-carrying cable ferry, the Windermere Ferry, runs frequent services across Windermere. There are also seasonal passenger boats on Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater.\\r\\nThere are many paths over which the public has a right of way, all of which should be signposted. Within the area of the National Park in 2012 there were 2,159?km (1,342?mi) of public footpaths, 875?km (544?mi) of public bridleways, 15?km (9?mi) of restricted byways and 30?km (19?mi) of byways open to all traffic. There is also a general \\"right to roam\\" in open country.[17]\\r\\nMany of these tracks arose centuries ago and were used either as ridge highways (such as along High Street) or as passes for travelling across the ridges between settlements in the valleys. Historically these paths were not planned for reaching summits, but more recently they are used by fell walkers for that purpose.[18]\\r\\nCycling and horse riding are allowed on bridleways, but cyclists must give way to all other users. Motor vehicles are only allowed on \\"byways open to all traffic\\" (green lanes) but in practice Traffic Regulation Orders have been brought in on several prohibiting motor traffic, although a system of permits operates on Gatesgarth Pass.[19]\\r\\nAs the highest ground in England, Scafell Pike naturally has a very extensive view on a clear day, ranging from the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland to Snowdonia in Wales. The Lake District takes the form of a roughly circular upland massif deeply dissected by a broadly radial pattern of major valleys whose character is largely the product of repeated glaciations over the last 2?million years. Most of these valleys display the U-shaped cross-section characteristic of glacial origin, and often contain elongate lakes occupying sizeable bedrock hollows, often with tracts of relatively flat ground at their heads. Smaller lakes known as tarns occupy glacial cirques at higher elevations. It is the abundance of both which has led to the area becoming known as the Lake District.\\r\\nThe mountains of the Lake District are also known as the \\"Cumbrian Mountains\\", although this name is less frequently used than terms like \\"the Lake District\\" or \\"the Lakeland Fells\\". Many of the higher fells are rocky, while moorland predominates at lower altitudes. Vegetation cover across better drained areas includes bracken and heather, though much of the land is boggy, due to the high rainfall. Deciduous native woodland occurs on many steeper slopes below the tree line, but with native oak supplemented by extensive conifer plantations in many areas, particularly Grizedale Forest in the generally lower southern part of the area.\\r\\nThe principal radial valleys are (clockwise from the south) Dunnerdale, Eskdale, Wasdale, Ennerdale, Lorton Vale and the Buttermere valley, the Derwent Valley and Borrowdale, the valleys containing Ullswater and Haweswater, Longsleddale, the Kentmere valley and those radiating from the head of Windermere including Great Langdale. The valleys break the mountains up into separate blocks, which have been described by various authors in different ways. The most frequently encountered approach is that made popular by Alfred Wainwright who published seven separate area guides to the Lakeland Fells.\\r\\nBelow the tree line are wooded areas, including British and European native oak woodlands and introduced softwood plantations. The woodlands provide habitats for native English wildlife. The native red squirrel is found in the Lake District and in a few other parts of England. In parts of the Lake District the rainfall is higher than in any other part of England. This gives Atlantic mosses, ferns, lichen, and liverworts the chance to grow. There is some ancient woodland in the National Park. Management of the woodlands varies: some are coppiced, some pollarded, some left to grow naturally, and some provide grazing and shelter.\\r\\nThe four highest mountains in the Lake District exceed 3,000 feet (914?m). These are:\\r\\nThe Northern Fells are a clearly defined range of hills contained within a 13?km (8?mi) diameter circle between Keswick in the south west and Caldbeck in the north east. They culminate in the 931?m (3,054?ft) peak of Skiddaw. Other notable peaks are Blencathra (also known as Saddleback) (868?m (2,848?ft)) and Carrock Fell. Bassenthwaite Lake occupies the valley between this massif and the North Western Fells.\\r\\nThe North Western Fells lie between Borrowdale and Bassenthwaite Lake to the east and Buttermere and Lorton Vale to the west. Their southernmost point is at Honister Pass. This area includes the Derwent Fells above the Newlands Valley and hills to the north amongst which are Dale Head, Robinson. To the north stand Grasmoor, highest in the range at 852?m (2,795?ft), Grisedale Pike and the hills around the valley of Coledale, and in the far north west is Thornthwaite Forest and Lord's Seat. The fells in this area are rounded Skiddaw slate, with few tarns and relatively few rock faces.\\r\\nThe Western Fells lie between Buttermere and Wasdale, with Sty Head forming the apex of a large triangle. Ennerdale bisects the area, which consists of the High Stile ridge north of Ennerdale, the Loweswater Fells in the far north west, the Pillar group in the south west, and Great Gable (899?m (2,949?ft)) near Sty Head. Other tops include Seatallan, Haystacks and Kirk Fell. This area is craggy and steep, with the impressive pinnacle of Pillar Rock its showpiece. Wastwater, located in this part, is England's deepest lake.\\r\\nThe Central Fells are lower in elevation than surrounding areas of fell, peaking at 762?m (2,500?ft) at High Raise. They take the form of a ridge running between Derwent Water in the west and Thirlmere in the east, from Keswick in the north to Langdale Pikes in the south. A spur extends south east to Loughrigg Fell above Ambleside. The central ridge running north over High Seat is exceptionally boggy.\\r\\nThe Eastern Fells consist of a long north-to-south ridge, the Helvellyn range, running from Clough Head to Seat Sandal with the 950?m (3,118?ft) Helvellyn at its highest point. The western slopes of these summits tend to be grassy, with rocky corries and crags on the eastern side. The Fairfield group lies to the south of the range, and forms a similar pattern with towering rock faces and hidden valleys spilling into the Patterdale valley. It culminates in the height of Red Screes overlooking the Kirkstone Pass.\\r\\nThe Far Eastern Fells refer to all of the Lakeland fells to the east of Ullswater and the A592 road running south to Windermere. At 828?m (2,717?ft), the peak known as High Street is the highest point on a complex ridge which runs broadly northÿsouth and overlooks the hidden valley of Haweswater to its east. In the north of this region are the lower fells of Martindale Common and Bampton Common whilst in the south are the fells overlooking the Kentmere valley. Further to the east, beyond Mardale and Longsleddale is Shap Fell, an extensive area consisting of high moorland, more rolling and Pennine in nature than the mountains to the west.\\r\\nThe Southern Fells occupy the southwestern quarter of the Lake District. They can be regarded as comprising a northern grouping between Wasdale, Eskdale and the two Langdale valleys, a southeastern group east of Dunnerdale and south of Little Langdale and a southwestern group bounded by Eskdale to the north and Dunnerdale to the east.\\r\\nThe first group includes England's highest mountains: Scafell Pike in the centre, at 978?m (3,209?ft) and Scafell one mile (1.6?km) to the southwest. Though it is slightly lower it has a 700?ft (210?m) rockface, Scafell Crag, on its northern side. It also includes the Wastwater Screes overlooking Wasdale, the Glaramara ridge overlooking Borrowdale, the three tops of Crinkle Crags, Bowfell and Esk Pike. The core of the area is drained by the infant River Esk. Collectively these are some of the Lake District's most rugged hillsides.\\r\\nThe second group, otherwise known as the Furness Fells or Coniston Fells, have as their northern boundary the steep and narrow Hardknott and Wrynose passes. The highest are Old Man of Coniston and Swirl How which slightly exceed 800?m (2,600?ft).\\r\\nThe third group to the west of the Duddon includes Harter Fell and the long ridge leading over Whitfell to Black Combe and the sea. The south of this region consists of lower forests and knolls, with Kirkby Moor on the southern boundary. The southwestern Lake District ends near the Furness peninsula and Barrow-in-Furness, a town which many Lake District residents rely on for basic amenities.\\r\\nThe southeastern area is the territory between Coniston Water and Windermere and east of Windermere towards Kendal and south to Lindale. There are no high summits in this area which is mainly low hills, knolls and limestone cuestas such as Gummer's How and Whitbarrow. Indeed, it rises only as high as 333?m (1,093?ft) at Top o' Selside east of Coniston Water; the wide expanse of Grizedale Forest stands between the two lakes. Kendal and Morecambe Bay stand at the eastern and southern edges of the area.\\r\\nOnly one of the lakes in the Lake District is called by that name, Bassenthwaite Lake. All the others such as Windermere, Coniston Water, Ullswater and Buttermere are meres, tarns and waters, with mere being the least common and water being the most common. The major lakes and reservoirs in the National Park are given below.\\r\\nThe Lake District's geology is very complex but well-studied.[20] A granite batholith beneath the area is responsible for this upland massif, its relatively low density causing the area to be \\"buoyed up\\". The granite can be seen at the surface as the Ennerdale, Skiddaw, Carrock Fell, Eskdale and Shap granites.\\r\\nBroadly speaking the area can be divided into three bands, the divisions between which run south west to north east. Generally speaking the rocks become younger from north west to south east. The north western band is composed of early to mid-Ordovician sedimentary rocks, largely mudstones and siltstones of marine origin. Together they comprise the Skiddaw Group and include the rocks traditionally known as the Skiddaw Slates. Their friability generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.\\r\\nThe central band is a mix of volcanic and sedimentary rocks of mid-to-late Ordovician age comprising the lavas and tuffs of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, erupted as the former Iapetus Ocean was subducted beneath what is now the Scottish border during the Caledonian orogeny. The northern central peaks, such as Great Rigg, were produced by considerable lava flows. These lava eruptions were followed by a series of pyroclastic eruptions which produced a series of calderas, one of which includes present-day Scafell Pike. These pyroclastic rocks give rise to the craggy landscapes typical of the central fells.[20]\\r\\nThe south eastern band comprises the mudstones and wackes of the Windermere Supergroup and which includes (successively) the rocks of the Dent, Stockdale, Tranearth, Coniston and Kendal groups. These are generally a little less resistant to erosion than the rocks sequence to the north and underlie much of the lower landscapes around Coniston and Windermere.[citation needed]\\r\\nLater intrusions have formed individual outcrops of igneous rock in each of these groups. Around the edges of these Ordovician and Silurian rocks on the northern, eastern and southern fringes of the area is a semi-continuous outcrop of Carboniferous Limestone seen most spectacularly at places like Whitbarrow Scar and Scout Scar. [21][22]\\r\\nThe Lake District's location on the northwest coast of England, coupled with its mountainous geography, makes it the wettest part of England. The UK Met Office reports average annual precipitation of more than 2,000?mm (80?in), but with very large local variation.\\r\\nAlthough the entire region receives above average rainfall, there is a wide disparity between the amount of rainfall in the western and eastern lakes, as the Lake District experiences relief rainfall. Seathwaite, Borrowdale is the wettest inhabited place in England with an average of 3,300?mm (130?in) of rain a year,[23] while nearby Sprinkling Tarn is even wetter, recording over 5,000?mm (200?in) per year; by contrast, Keswick, at the end of Borrowdale receives 1,470?mm (58?in) every year, and Penrith (just outside the Lake District) only 870?mm (34?in). March to June tend to be the driest months, with October to January the wettest, but at low levels there is relatively little difference between months.[citation needed]\\r\\nAlthough sheltered valleys experience gales on an average of only five days a year, the Lake District is generally very windy with the coastal areas having 20 days of gales, and the fell tops around 100 days of gales per year. The maritime climate means that the Lake District experiences relatively moderate temperature variations through the year. Mean temperature in the valleys ranges from about 3?C (37?F) in January to around 15?C (59?F) in July. (By comparison, Moscow, at the same latitude, ranges from ?10 to 19?C (14 to 66?F).)\\r\\nThe relatively low height of most of the fells means that, while snow is expected during the winter, they can be free of snow at any time of the year. Normally, significant snow fall only occurs between November and April. On average, snow falls on Helvellyn 67 days per year. During the year, valleys typically experience 20 days with snow falling, a further 200 wet days, and 145 dry days. Hill fog is common at any time of year, and the fells average only around 2.5 hours of sunshine per day, increasing to around 4.1 hours per day on the coastal plains.\\r\\nThe Lake District is home to a great variety of wildlife, due to its range of varied topography, lakes and forests. It provides a home for the red squirrel and colonies of sundew and butterwort, two of the few carnivorous plants native to Britain. The Lake District is a major sanctuary for the red squirrel and has the largest population in England (out of the estimated 140,000 red squirrels in the United Kingdom, compared with about 2.5?million grey squirrels).[26]\\r\\nThe Lake District is home to a range of bird species,[27] and the RSPB maintain a reserve in Haweswater.[28] England's only nesting pair of golden eagles can be found in the Lake District. The female golden eagle has not been seen since 2004 although the male still remains.[29] Conservationists believe he is now the only resident golden eagle in England.[30] Following recolonisation attempts, a pair of ospreys nested in the Lake District for the first time in over 150 years near Bassenthwaite Lake during 2001. Ospreys now frequently migrate north from Africa in the spring to nest in the Lake District, and a total of 23 chicks have fledged in The Lakes since 2001.[31] Another bird species which has had recolonisation attempts is the red kite which, as of 2012, have a population of approximately 90 in the dense forest areas near Grizedale.[32] Conservationists hope the reintroduction will create a large red kite population in the Lake District and in North West England where the red kite population is low.[33] Other bird species resident to the Lake District include the buzzard, dipper, peregrine and raven.[34] Seasonal birds include the ring ouzel and the redstart.[35]\\r\\nThe lakes of the Lake District support three rare and endangered species of fish: the vendace, which can be found only in Derwent Water and until 2008 in Bassenthwaite Lake.[36] Vendace have struggled in recent years with naturally occurring algae becoming a threat and the lakes gradually getting warmer.[37] Vendace have been moved to higher lakes on a number of occasions to preserve the species, notably in 2005 and 2011.[38][39] The Lakes are also home to two other rare species: the schelly, which lives in Brothers Water, Haweswater, Red Tarn and Ullswater, and the Arctic charr, which can be found in Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Thirlmere, Wast Water, and Windermere.\\r\\nIn recent years, some important changes have been made to fisheries byelaws covering the north west region of England, to help protect some of the rarest fish species. In 2002, the Environment Agency introduced a new fisheries byelaw, banning the use of all freshwater fish as live or dead bait in 14 of the lakes in the Lake District. Anglers not complying with the new byelaw can face fines of up to S2,500. There are 14 lakes in the Lake District which are affected. These are: Bassenthwaite Lake, Brothers Water, Buttermere, Coniston Water, Crummock Water, Derwent Water, Ennerdale Water, Haweswater, Loweswater, Red Tarn, Thirlmere, Ullswater, Wast Water and Windermere.\\r\\nThe lakes and waters of the Lake District do not naturally support as many species of fish as other similar habitats in the south of the country and elsewhere in Europe. Some fish that do thrive there are particularly at risk from introduction of new species.\\r\\nThe introduction of non-native fish can lead to the predation of the native fish fauna or competition for food. There is also the risk of disease being introduced, which can further threaten native populations. In some cases, the introduced species can disturb the environment so much that it becomes unsuitable for particular fish. For example, a major problem has been found with ruffe. This non-native fish has now been introduced into a number of lakes in recent years. It is known that ruffe eat the eggs of vendace, which are particularly vulnerable because of their long incubation period. This means that they are susceptible to predators for up to 120 days. The eggs of other fish, for example roach, are only at risk for as little as three days.\\r\\nFarming, and in particular sheep farming, has been the major industry in the region since Roman times. The breed most closely associated with the area is the tough Herdwick, with Rough Fell and Swaledale sheep also common. Sheep farming remains important both for the economy of the region and for preserving the landscape which visitors want to see. Features such as dry stone walls, for example, are there as a result of sheep farming. Some land is also used for silage and dairy farming.\\r\\nThe area was badly affected by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in Surrey in February, but had spread to Cumbria by end of March.[40] Thousands of sheep, include the native Herdwicks which graze on the fellsides across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was that many of the lost sheep were heafed, that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet electric fences strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to \\"re-heaf\\".[41] At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as Ryeland and Herdwick in the district,[42] however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.[43]\\r\\nForestry has also assumed greater importance over the course of the last century with the establishment of extensive conifer plantations around Whinlatter Pass, in Ennerdale and at Grizedale Forest amongst other places. There are extensive plantations of non-native pine trees.\\r\\nWith its wealth of rock types and their abundance in the landscape, mining and quarrying have long been significant activities in the Lake District economy. In Neolithic times, the Lake District was a major source of stone axes, examples of which have been found all over Britain. The primary site, on the slopes of the Langdale Pikes, is sometimes described as a \\"stone axe factory\\" of the Langdale axe industry. Some of the earliest stone circles in Britain are connected with this industry.\\r\\nMining, particularly of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), baryte, graphite and slate, was historically a major Lakeland industry, mainly from the 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide charcoal for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the Honister Mines, at the top of Honister Pass. Abandoned mine workings can be found on fellsides throughout the district. The locally mined graphite led to the development of the pencil industry, especially around Keswick.\\r\\nIn the middle of the 19th century, half the world textile industry's bobbin supply came from the Lake District area. Over the past century, however, tourism has grown rapidly to become the area's primary source of income.\\r\\nEarly visitors to the Lake District, who travelled for the education and pleasure of the journey, include Celia Fiennes who in 1698 undertook a journey the length of England, including riding through Kendal and over Kirkstone Pass into Patterdale. Her experiences and impressions were published in her book Great Journey to Newcastle and Cornwall:\\r\\nAs I walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by those inaccessible high rocky barren hills which hang over ones head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents of water from the sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.[44]\\r\\nIn 1724, Daniel Defoe published the first volume of A Tour Thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain. He commented on Westmorland that it was:\\r\\nthe wildest, most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in England, or even Wales itself; the west side, which borders on Cumberland, is indeed bounded by a chain of almost unpassable mountains which, in the language of the country, are called fells.\\r\\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the area was becoming more popular with travellers. This was partly a result of wars in Continental Europe, restricting the possibility of travel there. In 1778 Thomas West produced A Guide to the Lakes, which began the era of modern tourism.\\r\\nWest listed \\"stations\\", viewpoints where tourists could enjoy the best views of the landscape, being encouraged to appreciated the formal qualities of the landscape and to apply aesthetic values. At some of these stations, buildings were erected to help this process. The remains of Claife Station (on the western shore Windermere below Claife Heights) can be visited today.\\r\\nWilliam Wordsworth published his Guide to the Lakes in 1810, and by 1835 it had reached its fifth edition, now called A Guide Through the District of the Lakes in the North of England. This book was particularly influential in popularising the region. Wordsworth's favourite valley was Dunnerdale or the Duddon Valley nestling in the south west of the Lake District.\\r\\nThe railways led to another expansion in tourism. The Kendal and Windermere Railway was the first to penetrate the Lake District, reaching Kendal in 1846 and Windermere in 1847. The line to Coniston opened in 1848 (although until 1857 this was only linked to the national network with ferries between Fleetwood and Barrow-in-Furness); the line from Penrith through Keswick to Cockermouth in 1865; and the line to Lakeside at the foot of Windermere in 1869. The railways, built with traditional industry in mind, brought with them a huge increase in the number of visitors, thus contributing to the growth of the tourism industry. Railway services were supplemented by steamer boats on the major lakes of Ullswater, Windermere, Coniston Water, and Derwent Water.\\r\\nThe growth in tourist numbers continued into the age of the motor car, when railways began to be closed or run down. The formation of the Lake District National Park in 1951 recognised the need to protect the Lake District environment from excessive commercial or industrial exploitation, preserving that which visitors come to see, without any restriction on the movement of people into and around the district. The M6 Motorway helped bring traffic to the Lake District, passing up its eastern flank. The narrow roads present a challenge for traffic flow and, from the 1960s, certain areas have been very congested.\\r\\nWhilst the roads and railways provided easier access to the area, many people were drawn to Lakeland by the publication of the Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells by Alfred Wainwright. First published between 1955 and 1966, these books provided detailed information on 214 fells across the region, with carefully hand-drawn maps and panoramas, and also stories and asides which add to the colour of the area. They are still used by many visitors to the area as guides for walking excursions, with the ultimate goal of bagging the complete list of Wainwrights. The famous guides were revised by Chris Jesty between 2005 and 2009 to reflect changes, mainly in valley access and paths, and are currently being revised by Clive Hutchby, the author of The Wainwright Companion. The first of the revised volumes, Book One: The Eastern Fells, was published in March 2015.[45]\\r\\nSince the early 1960s, the National Park Authority has employed rangers to help cope with increasing tourism and development, the first being John Wyatt, who has since written a number of guide books. He was joined two years later by a second, and since then the number of rangers has been rising.\\r\\nThe area has also become associated with writer Beatrix Potter. A number of tourists visit to see her family home, with particularly large numbers coming from Japan.\\r\\nTourism has now become the park's major industry, with about 12?million visitors each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US.[46] Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35?million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The negative impact of tourism has been seen, however. Soil erosion, caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two tourist information centres in the National Park were closed.\\r\\nCultural tourism is becoming an increasingly important part of the wider tourist industry. The Lake District's links with a wealth of artists and writers and its strong history of providing summer theatre performances in the old Blue Box of Century Theatre are strong attractions for visiting tourists. The tradition of theatre is carried on by venues such as Theatre by the Lake in Keswick with its summer season of six plays in repertoire, Christmas and Easter productions, and the many literature, film, mountaineering, jazz and creative arts festivals, such as the Kendal Mountain Festival and the Keswick Mountain Festival.\\r\\nThe Lake District has been regarded as one of the best places to eat in Britain.[47] The region has four Michelin Star restaurants: L'Enclume, The Samling in Ambleside, The Forest Side and Gilpin Hotel. In addition, Cumbria has more microbreweries than any other county in Britain and together with Jennings Brewery supply a variety of ales to pubs and restaurants throughout the region.\\r\\nThe Lake District is intimately associated with English literature of the 18th and 19th centuries. Thomas Gray was the first to bring the region to attention, when he wrote a journal of his Grand Tour in 1769, but it was William Wordsworth whose poems were most famous and influential. Wordsworth's poem \\"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\\", inspired by the sight of daffodils on the shores of Ullswater, remains one of the most famous in the English language. Out of his long life of eighty years, sixty were spent amid its lakes and mountains, first as a schoolboy at Hawkshead, and afterwards living in Grasmere (1799ÿ1813) and Rydal Mount (1813ÿ50). Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey became known as the Lake Poets.\\r\\nThe poet and his wife lie buried in the churchyard of Grasmere and very near to them are the remains of Hartley Coleridge (son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge), who himself lived for many years in Keswick, Ambleside and Grasmere. Robert Southey, the Poet Laureate and friend of Wordsworth (who would succeed Southey as Laureate in 1843), was a resident of Keswick for forty years (1803ÿ43), and was buried in Crosthwaite churchyard. Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived for some time in Keswick, and also with the Wordsworths at Grasmere. From 1807 to 1815 John Wilson lived at Windermere. Thomas de Quincey spent the greater part of the years 1809 to 1828 at Grasmere, in the first cottage which Wordsworth had inhabited. Ambleside, or its environs, was also the place of residence both of Thomas Arnold, who spent there the vacations of the last ten years of his life and of Harriet Martineau, who built herself a house there in 1845. At Keswick, Mrs Lynn Linton (wife of William James Linton) was born, in 1822. Brantwood, a house beside Coniston Water, was the home of John Ruskin during the last years of his life. His assistant W. G. Collingwood the author, artist and antiquarian lived nearby, and wrote Thorstein of the Mere, set in the Norse period.\\r\\nIn addition to these residents or natives of the Lake District, a variety of other poets and writers made visits to the Lake District or were bound by ties of friendship with those already mentioned above. These include Percy Bysshe Shelley, Sir Walter Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Arthur Hugh Clough, Henry Crabb Robinson, \\"Conversation\\" Sharp, Thomas Carlyle, John Keats, Lord Tennyson, Matthew Arnold, Felicia Hemans, and Gerald Massey.\\r\\nAlthough it is unlikely she ever went there, Letitia Elizabeth Landon produced no less than sixteen poems on subjects within the Lake District and its surroundings, all associated with engravings within Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books, from 1832 to 1838. Also included there (1834) is Grasmere Lake (A Sketch by a Cockney), a skit on becoming a 'lakes poet'.\\r\\nDuring the early 20th century, the children's author Beatrix Potter was in residence at Hill Top Farm, setting many of her famous Peter Rabbit books in the Lake District. Her life was made into a biopic film, starring Rene Zellweger and Ewan McGregor. Arthur Ransome lived in several areas of the Lake District, and set five of his Swallows and Amazons series of books, published between 1930 and 1947, in a fictionalised Lake District setting. So did Geoffrey Trease with his five Black Banner school stories (1949ÿ56), starting with No Boats on Bannermere.\\r\\nThe novelist Sir Hugh Walpole lived at \\"Brackenburn\\" on the lower slopes of Catbells overlooking Derwent Water from 1924 until his death in 1941. Whilst living at \\"Brackenburn\\" he wrote The Herries Chronicle detailing the history of a fictional Cumbrian family over two centuries. The noted author and poet Norman Nicholson came from the south west lakes, living and writing about Millom in the 20th century ÿ he was known as the last of the Lake Poets and came close to becoming the Poet Laureate.\\r\\nThe Lakes has been an inspirations for many notable artists. Some of the most famous artists to depict the region in their work have been Alfred Heaton Cooper and William Heaton Cooper.\\r\\nWriter and author Melvyn Bragg was brought up in the region and has used it as the setting for some of his work, such as his novel A Time to Dance, later turned into a television drama.\\r\\nThe Lake District has been the setting for crime novels by Reginald Hill, Val McDermid and Martin Edwards. The region is also a recurring theme in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novella The Torrents of Spring and features prominently in Ian McEwan's Amsterdam, which won the 1998 Booker Prize. The 1996 Eisner Award winning graphic novel The Tale of One Bad Rat by Bryan Talbot featured a young girls journey to and subsequent stay in the Lake District.\\r\\nThe Lake District is mentioned in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice; Elizabeth Bennet looks forward to a holiday there with her aunt and uncle and is \\"excessively disappointed\\" upon learning they cannot travel that far.\\r\\nThe opening of Charlotte Turner Smith's novel Ethelinde with its atmospheric description of Grasmere (complete with a Gothic Abbey!) is supposed to have induced Wordsworth into looking to it as a possible place of residence.\\r\\nFilm director Ken Russell lived in the Keswick/Borrowdale area until 2007[48] and used it in films such as Tommy and Mahler.\\r\\nThe Lake District is the setting for the 1977 Richard Adams novel The Plague Dogs. Adams' knowledge of the area offers the reader a precise view of the natural beauty of the Lake District.\\r\\nSome students of Arthurian lore identify the Lake District with the Grail kingdom of Listeneise.\\r\\nThe former Keswick School of Industrial Art at Keswick was started by Canon Rawnsley, a friend of John Ruskin.\\r\\nAlso set in the Lake District is Sophie Jackson's mystery novel The Woman Died Thrice.[49] It was published in 2016 under Jackson's pen name Evelyn James.\\r\\nA number of words and phrases are local to the Lake District and are part of the Cumbrian dialect, though many are shared by other northern dialects. These include:\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 5430N 310W? / ?54.500N 3.167W? / 54.500; -3.167","input":"Where is the lake district national park located?"},{"output":"over 6,000 years","context":"The Ogallala Aquifer is a shallow water table aquifer surrounded by sand, silt, clay and gravel located beneath the Great Plains in the United States. One of the world's largest aquifers, it underlies an area of approximately 174,000?sq?mi (450,000?km2) in portions of eight states (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas).[1] It was named in 1898 by geologist N. H. Darton from its type locality near the town of Ogallala, Nebraska. The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer System, and rests on the Ogallala Formation, which is the principal geologic unit underlying 80% of the High Plains.[2][3]\\r\\nLarge scale extraction for agricultural purposes started after World War II due partially to center pivot irrigation and to the adaptation of automotive engines for groundwater wells.[4] Today about 27% of the irrigated land in the entire United States lies over the aquifer, which yields about 30% of the ground water used for irrigation in the United States.[5] The aquifer is at risk for over-extraction and pollution. Since 1950, agricultural irrigation has reduced the saturated volume of the aquifer by an estimated 9%. Once depleted, the aquifer will take over 6,000 years to replenish naturally through rainfall.[6]\\r\\nThe aquifer system supplies drinking water to 82% of the 2.3 million people (1990 census) who live within the boundaries of the High Plains study area.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deposition of aquifer material dates back two to six million years, from the late Miocene to early Pliocene ages when the southern Rocky Mountains were still tectonically active. From the uplands to the west, rivers and streams cut channels in a generally west to east or southeast direction. Erosion of the Rockies provided alluvial and aeolian sediment that filled the ancient channels and eventually covered the entire area of the present-day aquifer, forming the water-bearing Ogallala Formation.[8][9] In that respect, the process is similar to those currently prevailing in other modern rivers of the area, such as the Kansas River and its tributaries. The major differences are time and depth.\\r\\nThe depth of the Ogallala varies with the shape of then-prevailing surface, being deepest where it fills ancient valleys and channels. The Ogallala Formation consists mostly of coarse sedimentary rocks in its deeper sections, which transition upward into finer-grained material.[10]\\r\\nThe water-saturated thickness of the Ogallala Formation ranges from a few feet to more than 1,000?feet (300?m) and is generally greater in the Northern Plains.[11] The depth of the water below the surface of the land ranges from almost 400 feet (120?m) in parts of the north to between 100 and 200 feet (30 and 61?m) throughout much of the south. Present-day recharge of the aquifer with fresh water occurs at an exceedingly slow rate, suggesting that much of the water in its pore spaces is paleowater, dating back to the most recent ice age and probably earlier.\\r\\nGroundwater within the Ogallala generally flows from west to east at an average rate of a foot per day. Hydraulic conductivity, or the ability for a fluid (water) to move through porous material, ranges from 25 to 300 feet (7.6 to 91.4?m) per day.[12] Water quality within the Ogallala varies with the highest quality for drinking and irrigation in the northern region while the southern region had the poorest.[13] Human and natural processes over the past 60 to 70 years, including irrigation density, climate, and nitrogen applications, have caused higher concentrations of contaminants including nitrates. Nitrate levels generally meet USGS water quality standards, but continue to gradually increase over time.[13] This trend can impact the future groundwater sustainability for portions of the aquifer.\\r\\nAn aquifer is a groundwater storage reservoir in the water cycle. While groundwater is a renewable source, reserves replenish relatively slowly. The USGS has performed several studies of the aquifer, to determine what is coming in (groundwater recharge from the surface), what is leaving (water pumped out and baseflow to streams), and what the net changes in storage are (rise, fall or no change).\\r\\nWithdrawals from the Ogallala Aquifer for irrigation amounted to 26?km3 (21,000,000?acre?ft) in 2000. As of 2005, the total depletion since before development amounted to 253,000,000 acre feet (312?km3).[1] Some estimates indicate the remaining volume could be depleted as soon as 2028. Many farmers in the Texas High Plains, which rely particularly on the underground source, are now turning away from irrigated agriculture as they become aware of the hazards of overpumping.[14]\\r\\nThe rate at which recharge water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits the amount of water able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available recharge area. The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.\\r\\nRecharge in the aquifer ranges from 0.024 inches (0.61?mm) per year in parts of Texas and New Mexico to 6 inches (150?mm) per year in south-central Kansas.[15]\\r\\nThe regions overlying the Ogallala Aquifer are some of the most productive regions in the United States for ranching livestock, and growing corn, wheat, and soybeans. The success of large-scale farming in areas that do not have adequate precipitation and do not always have perennial surface water for diversion has depended heavily on pumping groundwater for irrigation.\\r\\nEarly settlers of the semiarid High Plains were plagued by crop failures due to cycles of drought, culminating in the disastrous Dust Bowl of the 1930s. Only after World War II, when center pivot irrigation became available, was the land mass of the High Plains aquifer system transformed into one of the most agriculturally productive regions in the world.\\r\\nGround water levels decline when the rate of extraction by irrigation exceeds the rate of recharge. At places, the water table was measured to drop more than 5?ft (1.5?m) per year at the time of maximum extraction. In extreme cases, the deepening of wells was required to reach the steadily falling water table. In the 21st century, recognition of the significance of the aquifer has led to increased coverage from regional and international journalists.[16][17][18][19]\\r\\nThe USGS estimated that total water storage was about 2,925,000,000 acre feet (3,608?km3) in 2005. This is a decline of about 253,000,000 acre feet (312?km3), or 9%, since substantial groundwater irrigation development began in the 1950s.[1]\\r\\nWater conservation practices (terracing and crop rotation), more efficient irrigation methods (center pivot and drip), and reduced area under irrigation have helped to slow depletion of the aquifer, but levels are generally still dropping in areas including southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle. In other areas, such as parts of eastern and central Nebraska and of the region south of Lubbock, Texas, water levels have risen since 1980.\\r\\nThe center-pivot irrigator was described as the \\"villain\\"[20] in a New York Times article, \\"Wells Dry, Fertile Plains Turn to Dust\\" recounting the relentless decline of parts of the Ogallala Aquifer. Sixty years of intensive farming using huge center-pivot irrigators has emptied parts of the High Plains Aquifer.[20] Hundreds to thousands of years of rainfall would be needed to replace the groundwater in the depleted aquifer. In 1950, irrigated cropland covered 250,000 acres (100,000?ha). With the use of center-pivot irrigation, nearly three million acres of land were irrigated.[20] In some places in the Texas Panhandle, the water table has been drained (dewatered). \\"Vast stretches of Texas farmland lying over the aquifer no longer support irrigation. In west-central Kansas, up to a fifth of the irrigated farmland along a 100-mile swath (160?km) of the aquifer has already gone dry.\\"[20]\\r\\nThe center-pivot irrigation system is considered to be a highly efficient system which helps conserve water. However, by 2013, as the water consumption efficiency of the center-pivot irrigator improved over the years, farmers chose to plant more intensively, irrigate more land, and grow thirstier crops rather than reduce water consumption.[20] One approach to reducing the amount of groundwater used is to employ treated recycled water for irrigation; another approach is to change to crops that require less water, such as sunflowers.[21]\\r\\nSeveral rivers, such as the Platte, run below the water level of the aquifer. Because of this, the rivers receive groundwater flow (baseflow), carrying it out of the region rather than recharging the aquifer.\\r\\nThe $46.1-million Optima Lake dam in western Oklahoma was rendered useless when the dropping level of the aquifer drastically reduced flow of the Beaver River, the lake's intended source of water.[22]\\r\\nThe depletion between 2001 and 2008, inclusive, is about 32% of the cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century.[23] In the United States, the biggest users of water from aquifers include agricultural irrigation and oil and coal extraction.[24]\\"Cumulative total groundwater depletion in the United States accelerated in the late 1940s and continued at an almost steady linear rate through the end of the century. In addition to widely recognized environmental consequences, groundwater depletion also adversely impacts the long-term sustainability of groundwater supplies to help meet the nations water needs.\\"[23]\\r\\nSince the 1940s, pumping from the Ogallala has drawn the aquifer down more than 300 feet (90?m) in some areas. Producers have taken steps to reduce their reliance on irrigated water. Streamlined operations allow them to produce significantly greater yield using roughly the same amount of water needed four decades ago. Still, losses to the aquifer between 2001 and 2011 equated to a third of its cumulative depletion during the entire 20th century. The Ogallala is recharged primarily by rainwater, but only about one inch of precipitation actually reaches the aquifer annually. Rainfall in most of the Texas High Plains is minimal, evaporation is high, and infiltration rates are slow.[25]\\r\\nIn 2008, TransCanada Corporation proposed the construction of the 1,661-mile (2,673?km) Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from the Athabasca oil sands of Alberta to refineries near Houston, Texas.[26][27] The proposed route of the pipeline crosses the eastern part of the Nebraska Sandhills; opponents of the route cite the risk to the Ogallala Aquifer posed by the possibility of contamination from spilled dilute bitumen.[28][29]\\r\\nResearch hydrogeologist James Goeke, professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska, who has spent more than 40 years studying the Ogallala Aquifer, phoned TransCanada officials and quizzed them on the project, and satisfied himself that danger to the aquifer was small, because he believes that a spill would be unlikely to penetrate down into the aquifer, and if it did, he believes that the contamination would be localized. He noted: \\"A lot of people in the debate about the pipeline talk about how leakage would foul the water and ruin the entire water supply in the state of Nebraska and thats just a false\\", [30] Goeke said \\"... a leak from the XL pipeline would pose a minimal risk to the aquifer as a whole.\\"[31]\\r\\nPipeline industry spokesmen have noted that thousands of miles of existing pipelines carrying crude oil and refined liquid hydrocarbons have crossed over the Ogallala Aquifer for years, in southeast Wyoming, eastern Colorado and New Mexico, western Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.[32][33][34][35][36] The Pioneer crude oil pipeline crosses east-west across Nebraska, and the Pony Express pipeline, which crosses the Ogallala Aquifer in Colorado, Nebraska, and Kansas, was being converted as of 2013 from natural gas to crude oil, under a permit from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.[37]\\r\\nAs the lead agency in the transboundary pipeline project, the U.S. State Department commissioned an environmental-impact assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Environmental Impact Statement concluded that the project posed little threat of \\"adverse environmental impacts\\",[28][38] the report was drafted by Cardno Entrix, a company that assisted both the Department of State and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in preparing environmental impact statements for other proposed TransCanda projects. Although it is \\"common for companies applying to build government projects to be involved in assigning and paying for the impact analysis\\",[39] several opponents of the project suggested there could be a conflict of interest. In response to that concern, the Department of State's Office of the Inspector General conducted an investigation of the potential conflict of interest. The February 2012 report of that investigation states no conflict of interest existed either in the selection of the contractor or in the preparation of the environmental impact statement.[40]\\r\\nU.S. President Barack Obama \\"initially rejected the Keystone XL pipeline in January 2012, saying he wanted more time for an environmental review.\\"[41] On February 17, 2013, a rally at the National Mall drew an estimated 40,000 in protest of Keystone XL.[41] In January 2014, the U.S. State Department released its Keystone pipeline Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Keystone XL Project Executive Summary, which concluded that, according to models, a large crude oil spill from the pipeline that reached the Ogallala could spread as far as 1,214 feet (370?m), with dissolved components spreading as much as 1,050?ft (320?m) further.[42]\\r\\nSince 2010, the North Plains Groundwater Conservation District, which encompasses eight counties north of Amarillo, including Moore and Dallam Counties, has offered a $300,000 annual demonstration project to conserve water that farmers pump from the Ogallala Aquifer. Participating farmers grow corn with just over half of the water that they would normally require to irrigate the fields, or they plant several weeks later than customary. Pivot sprinklers are used in the project, rather than the more expensive drip irrigation. According to district manager Steve Walthour, conservation is essential considering declining levels of the aquifer.[43] The local non-profit organization Ogallala Commons, named for the aquifer itself, which not only collaborates and supports the local communicates, also works to conserve the Ogallala Aquifer and the surrounding area.[44][45][46]\\r\\nEleven farmers in 2013 participated in the conservation program, with some planting in dry earth, rather than watered soil. They are leaving more space between plants, a technique that retains moisture for a longer period of time. Soil sensors permit farmers to gather accurate information about the moisture level of their crops. The motivation to save water comes from the district's regulations on extracting water from the aquifer. The United States Geological Survey determined the water level in the aquifer has dropped more in Texas than in any other state in the basin.[43]\\r\\nFarmers on their own land may draw water without charge from the aquifer. Pumping costs are low because the fuel used, natural gas, is inexpensive. The North Plains district first established limits on pumping in 2005 and tightened the regulations four years later. Certain wells are now required to have meters. Yet another challenge facing the district is that higher prices for crops[when?] have prompted some to plant additional fields and further increase the use of water from the aquifer.[43]\\r\\nCoordinates: 365926N 1012652W? / ?36.99056N 101.44778W? / 36.99056; -101.44778\\r\\nEnvironmental Science","input":"How long does it take for the ogallala aquifer to recharge?"},{"output":"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos","context":"The World's Billionaires is an annual ranking by documented net worth of the world's wealthiest billionaires compiled and published in March annually by the American business magazine Forbes. The list was first published in March 1987.[1] The total net worth of each individual on the list is estimated and is cited in United States dollars, based on their documented assets and accounting for debt. Royalty and dictators whose wealth comes from their positions are excluded from these lists.[3] This ranking is an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained.[4]\\r\\nIn 2018, there was a record of 2,208 people on the list, that included 259 newcomers mostly from China and the U.S.; there were 63 people under 40 and it had a record number of 256 women.[2] The average net worth of the list came in at US$4.1?billion, up US$350?million from 2017. Added together, the total net worth for 2018's billionaires was US$9.1?trillion, up from US$7.67?trillion in 2017.[2][5][6] As of 2018[update], Microsoft founder Bill Gates has topped the list 18 of the past 24 years, while Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is ranked at the top for the first time and he became the first centibillionaire included in the ranking.[5]\\r\\nIn 2017, 500 of the richest people in the world became richer by $1 trillion, according to a report by Bloomberg News.[7][8] According to a 2017 Oxfam report, the top eight billionaires own as much combined wealth as \\"the poorest half of the human race\\".[9][10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEach year, Forbes employs a team of more than 50 reporters from a variety of countries to track the activity of the world's wealthiest individuals.[11] Preliminary surveys are sent to those who may qualify for the list. According to Forbes, they received three types of responses?ÿ some people try to inflate their wealth, others cooperate but leave out details, and some refuse to answer any questions.[12] Business deals are then scrutinized and estimates of valuable assets?ÿ land, homes, vehicles, artwork, etc.?ÿ are made. Interviews are conducted to vet the figures and improve the estimate of an individual's holdings. Finally, positions in a publicly traded stock are priced to market on a date roughly a month before publication. Privately held companies are priced by the prevailing price-to-sales or price-to-earnings ratios. Known debt is subtracted from assets to get a final estimate of an individual's estimated worth in United States dollars. Since stock prices fluctuate rapidly, an individual's true wealth and ranking at the time of publication may vary from their situation when the list was compiled.[11]\\r\\nFamily fortunes dispersed over a large number of relatives are included only if those individuals' holdings are worth more than a billion dollars. However, when a living individual has dispersed his or her wealth to immediate family members, it is included under a single listing provided that individual is still living.[11] Royal families and dictators that have their wealth contingent on a position are always excluded from these lists.[13]\\r\\nThe rankings are published annually in March, so the net worth listed are snapshots taken at that time. These lists only show the top 10 wealthiest billionaires for each year.\\r\\nOn the 32nd list of world's billionaires, the gap between the top one percent and the rest of the billionaires continued to widen, with the 20 richest people on the planet worth $1.2 trillion that amounts to 13 percent of all billionaires' fortunes combined.[2] A record of 2,208 billionaires were in the ranking and the total wealth was $9.1 trillion, up 18% since 2017. For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one year gain in wealth since Forbes started tracking in 1987 by gaining over $35 billion in one year.[2] The U.S. continued to have the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 585, while China is catching up with 476 (when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).\\r\\n(March 2018)\\r\\nOn the 30th anniversary of the Forbes' list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed, that included 195 newcomers that included 76 from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[14] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this is the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67?trillion, up from US$7.1?trillion in 2015.[5][6] This is the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China has 319 (not including Hong Kong or Macau), Germany has 114, and India has the fourth most with 101; India has reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\\r\\nFor the third year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's 2016 list of the world's billionaires.[15] This is the 17th time that the founder of Microsoft has claimed the top spot. Amancio Ortega rose from last year's position of number four to second.[16] Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway came in third for the second consecutive time,[17] while Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim slipped down from last year's second position to fourth. Jeff Bezos of Amazon,[18] Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook[19] and Michael Bloomberg of Bloomberg L.P.,[20] appear for the first time on the Forbes top 10 billionaires list, coming at fifth, sixth and eighth position, respectively. Zuckerberg became the youngest top 10 billionaire this year at the age of 31. Larry Ellison, Charles Koch and David Koch also slipped down from their last year's positions, with Ellison dropping to seventh from fifth and the Kochs falling to ninth position from sixth, respectively.\\r\\nIn the 29th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, a record 1,826 billionaires were named with an aggregated net worth of $7.1 trillion compared to $6.4 trillion last year. 46 of the billionaires in this list are under the age of 40. A record number of 290 people joined the list for the first time, of whom 25 percent hail from China, which produced a world-leading 71 newcomers. The United States came in second, with 57, followed by India, with 28, and Germany, with 23.[21] The United States has the largest number of billionaires with 526. Russia went down to 88 from 111 in 2014. Russia was placed behind China, Germany and India by the number of billionaires. Self-made billionaires made up the largest number of people on the list with 1,191 positions (over 65 percent) while just 230 (under 13 percent) have wealth through inheritance. The number of billionaires who inherited a portion but are still working to increase their fortunes is 405.[22]\\r\\nBill Gates was named the richest man in the world by Forbes's annual list of the world's billionaires. This was the 16th time that the founder of Microsoft claimed the top spot. Carlos Slim came in second for the second consecutive time.

Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle rounded off the top five. Christy Walton was the highest-ranking female at number eight. America's Evan Spiegel, co-founder of photo messaging app Snapchat became the youngest billionaire this year at the age of 24. At age 99, David Rockefeller maintained his position as the oldest billionaire to be included in the list.[23] Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, rose to number 16 with $33.4 billion. Iceland had a billionaire, Thor Bjorgolfsson, in the list after a gap of five years. Guatemala had a billionaire, Mario Lopez Estrada, for the first time in its history.[24]\\r\\nBill Gates added $9 billion to his fortune since 2013 and topped the Forbes 2014 billionaire list. He has topped the list 15 of the previous 20 years, but his previous number one ranking was in 2009.[25] Mexican telecommunication mogul Carlos Slim came in second place after being number one the previous four years. Zara founder Amancio Ortega placed third for the second consecutive year. American investor Warren Buffett was in the top five for the 20th consecutive year, placing fourth.[26] America's Christy Walton was the highest ranking woman, placing ninth overall.[1] Aliko Dangote of Nigeria became the first African ever to enter the top 25, with an estimated net worth of $25 billion.[3]\\r\\nA total of 1,645 people made the 2014 billionaire list, representing combined wealth of $6.4 trillion.[26] Of those, a record 268 were newcomers, surpassing 2008's 226 newcomers.[1] One hundred people listed in 2013 failed to make the list.[26] The number of women on the list rose to a record 172 in 2014.[1] Approximately 66 percent of the list was self-made, 13 percent achieved their wealth through inheritance alone, and 21 percent through a mixture of the two.[3]\\r\\nThe United States had 492 billionaires on the list, the most of any country.[26] The country also had the most newcomers with 50, and women with 54.[1] China had the second most billionaires with 152, while Russia was third with 111.[26] Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania, and Uganda were all represented on the list for the first time. Turkey saw the most people drop off the list, 19, due to a period of high inflation in the country.[3]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2013 billionaire list, marking his fourth consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates remained in second, while Amancio Ortega moved up to third. Ortega's gain of $19.5 billion was the largest of anyone on the list.[27] Warren Buffett failed to make the top three for the first time since 2000, placing fourth. Diesel founder Renzo Rosso was among the top newcomers, debuting with an estimate net worth of $3 billion.[28]\\r\\nA global rise in asset prices, led Forbes editor Randall Lane to declare \\"It [was] a very good year to be a billionaire\\". However, it was not a good year to be Eike Batista who fell from seventh to 100th, suffering the largest net loss of anyone on the list.[27] Overall, net gainers outnumbered net losers by 4:1.[28]\\r\\nA record total of 1,426 people made the 2013 list, representing $5.4 trillion of assets.[29] Of those, 442 billionaires hailed from the United States.[27] The Asian-Pacific region had 386 billionaires and Europe 366. The list also featured a record number of newcomers, 210, representing 42 different countries. Sixty people from the 2012 list fell below a billion dollar of assets in 2013 and eight others from the 2012 list died. The Asia-Pacific region had the most drop-offs, with 29, followed by the United States with 16. The 2013 list featured 138 women, of which 50 came from the United States. A majority of the list (961 individuals, 67 percent) was entirely self-made; 184 (13 percent) inherited their wealth, and 281 (20 percent) achieved their fortune through a combination of inheritance and business acumen.[29]\\r\\nCarlos Slim topped the 2012 list, marking this third consecutive year at the top. Bill Gates placed second, but narrowed the gap from 2011 as Slim's fortune fell $5 billion while Gates' rose $5 billion. Warren Buffett remained in third place. Bernard Arnault of France was the top-ranking European on the list, placing fourth.[30] Ricardo Salinas Pliego was the greatest gainer in terms of dollars, adding $9.2 billion to his fortune and moving up to number 37 overall.[30] Making her debut on the list at age 27, Spanx founder Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire ever.[31] Colombia's Alejandro Santo Domingo was the highest-ranked newcomer, inheriting a $9.5 billion stake in Santo Domingo Group from his father.[30] India's Lakshmi Mittal was the largest loser as his fortune dropped from $31.1 billion to $20.7 billion as the price of steel maker ArcelorMittal fell sharply.[30] As a result, he failed to make the top 10 for the first time since 2004 and lost his title of richest Asian to Hong Kongs Li Ka-shing.[32]\\r\\nA record total of 1,226 people made the 2012 list, representing 58 different countries. Of those, 126 were newcomers to the list and 104 were women. The United States had the greatest number of billionaires with 425. Russia had 96 people on the list, while China had 95.[30] Georgia, Morocco, and Peru were newly represented on the list. Falling stock prices in Asia contributed to 117 former billionaires falling from the list worldwide. Twelve others listed in 2011 died. Overall, net gainers (460) barely outnumbered net losers (441).[32]\\r\\nTo coincide with the release of the 2012 list, Forbes announced a new \\"Billionaire Real-Time Ticker\\" updating the wealth of the world's top fifty billionaires in real time.[30]\\r\\nIn the 25th annual Forbes list of global billionaires, Carlos Slim added $20.5 billion to his fortune, the most of anyone, and retained his number one ranking with a total fortune of $74 billion. Bill Gates remained in second place with $56 billion, while Warren Buffett was third with $50 billion. The top 10 had a combined wealth of $406 billion, up from $342 billion in 2010.[33] According to Forbes editor Kerry Dolan, \\"media and technology billionaires definitely benefited from a stronger stock market and a growing enthusiasm for all things social\\" since the 2010 list.[34] However, Nigerian commodity mogul Aliko Dangote was the greatest gainer on a percentage basis as his fortune increased 557 percent to $13.5 billion. Mark Zuckerberg was one of seven Facebook-related billionaires on the list, as he $9.5 billion to his fortune to move up to 52nd. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz was the youngest person on the list. Aged 26, eight days younger than Zuckerberg, he debuted at number 420 with an estimated fortune of $2.7 billion. IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was the largest loser as he saw his fortune plummet from $23 billion to $6 billion, dropping him from 11th to 162nd overall.[33]\\r\\nA record 1,210 billionaires made the 2011 list, representing a combined wealth of $4.5 trillion, up from $3.6 trillion the previous year.[35] One third of the world's billionaires, 413, came from the United States. China had the second most billionaires with 115, while Russia was third with 101. Asia moved up to 332 billionaires, passing Europe as a region for the first time since the 1990s.[33] The 2011 list included 214 newcomers and the average net worth of those on it increased to $3.7 billion.[34]\\r\\nCarlos Slim narrowly eclipsed Bill Gates to top the billionaire list for the first time. Slim saw his estimated worth surge $18.5 billion to $53.5 billion as shares of America Movil rose 35 percent. Gates' estimated wealth rose $13 billion to $53 billion, placing him second. Warren Buffett was third with $47 billion.[36] Christy Walton was the highest-ranking woman, placing 12th overall, with an inherited fortune of $22.5 billion.[37] At age 25, Mark Zuckerberg continued to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.[12] American Isaac Perlmutter was among the newcomers with an estimated fortune of $4 billion largely acquired in his sale of Marvel Entertainment to Disney.[36]\\r\\nA total of 1,011 people made the 2010 list. The United States accounted for 403 billionaires, followed by China with 89 and Russia with 62.[37] It was the first time China, while including Hong Kong, placed second.[36] A total of 55 countries were represented on the 2010 list, including Finland and Pakistan which claimed their first billionaires.[37] Eighty-nine women made the list, but only 14 of them were self-made.[37] The combined net worth of the list was $3.6 trillion, up 50 percent from 2009's $2.4 trillion, while the average net worth was $3.5 billion.[12]\\r\\nThe 2010 list featured 164 re-entries and 97 true newcomers.[12] Asia accounted for more than 100 of the new entrants. Overall, just 12 percent of the list lost wealth since 2009, and 30 people fell off the list. Thirteen others died.[36] Of the 89 women, 12 were newcomers in 2010.

Its rulers, of the Bhonsle dynasty, were entitled to a 19-gun salute ÿ thus Kolhapur was also known as a 19-gun state. The state flag was a swallow-tailed orange pennant.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKolhapur State, together with its jagirs or feudatory vassal estates (including Ichalkaranji), covered an area of 3,165 square miles (8,200?km2). According to the 1901 census, the state population was 910,011, of which 54,373 resided in Kolhapur Town. In 1901, the state enjoyed an estimated revenue of S300,000.[3]\\r\\nThe Maharajas of Kolhapur have a common ancestry with the Bhonsle dynasties of Tanjore and Satara, claiming descent from the Maratha royal clan Bhonsl. The states of Satara and Kolhapur came into being in 1707, because of the succession dispute over the Maratha kingship. Shahuji, the heir apparent to the Maratha kingdom, captured by the Mughals at the age of nine, remained their prisoner at the death of his father Sambhaji, the elder son of Shivaji Maharaj the founder of the Maratha Empire in 1689. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai (a widow of Rajaram Chhatrapati, younger son of Shivaji Maharaj) proclaimed her son Shivaji II, as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. The Mughals released Shahu under certain conditions in 1707, and he returned to claim his inheritance. He defeated the regent at the Battle of Khed and established himself at Satara, forcing her to retire with her son to Kolhapur. By 1710 two separate principalities had become an established fact. Shivaji II and Tarabai were soon deposed by the other widow of Rajaram, Rajasbai. She installed her own son, Sambhaji II as the new ruler of Kolhapur. Sambhaji II signed the Treaty of Warana in 1731 with his cousin Shahu to formalize the two separate seats of Bhonsle family. The British sent expeditions against Kolhapur in 1765 and 1792; Kolhapur entered into treaty relations with the British, after the collapse of the Maratha confederacy in 1812. In the early years of the 19th century the British invaded again, and appointed a political officer to temporarily manage the state.[4]\\r\\nA Brahmin regent called Daji Krishna Pandit was installed by the British to govern the state in 1843 at a time when the natural heir to the throne was underage. He took direction from a political agent of the East India Company and among their actions were reforms to the tax of land. These reforms caused much resentment and, despite Kolhapur having refrained from involvement in the previous Anglo-Maratha Wars, a revolt against the British began in 1844. The rebellion began with soldiers locking themselves into hill-forts such as those as Panhala and Vishalgad, and then spread to Kolhapur itself. Both the regent and the political agent were captured by the militia forces led by Babaji Ahirekar.[5]\\r\\nThe last ruler of Kolhapur was HH Maharaja Chhatrapati Shahaji II. After Indian independence in 1947, Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged into Bombay State on 1 March 1949. In 1960 Bombay state was divided by languages into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Our response, in 1963, was to send a petition framed by painted bark to the Commonwealth Government demanding that our rights be recognised.\\" [2]\\r\\nThe Yolngu people of Yirrkala sent the bark petitions to the Australian House of Representatives where they were tabled on 14 and 28 August 1963. The petitions were written in the Yolngu language, together with an English translation.[3] They are on permanent display at Parliament House, Canberra.\\r\\nThe bark petitions asserted that the Yolngu people owned the land and protested the Commonwealth's granting of mining rights to Nabalco of land excised from the Arnhem Aboriginal Land reserve.[4] The son of one of the Yirrkala plaintiffs, a Gumatj clan leader, Munggurrawuy, was Galarrwuy Yunupingu who assisted in drafting the petitions.\\r\\nThe petitions stated that \\"the land in question has been hunting and food gathering land for the Yirrkala tribes from time immemorial\\" and \\"that places sacred to the Yirrkala people, as well as vital to their livelihood are in the excised land\\". They expressed the petitioners' \\"fear that their needs and interests will be completely ignored as they have been ignored in the past\\". The petitions called on the House of Representatives to \\"appoint a Committee, accompanied by competent interpreters, to hear the views of the people of Yirrkala before permitting the excision\\" of the land for the mine and to ensure \\"that no arrangements be entered into with any company which will destroy the livelihood and independence of the Yirrkala people\\". Thus, the petitions are the first formal assertion of native title.\\r\\nThe Australian Government's response was to establish the House of Representatives Select Committee on Grievances of the Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve in 1963. In its report, the Select Committee recommended that the Yirrkala people should be compensated for loss of their traditional occupancy, by way of (1) land grant; (2) payment of at least the first $300,000 received in mining royalties; and (3) direct monetary compensation, even though Aboriginal land rights were not expressly recognised under Northern Territory laws.[5]\\r\\nHowever, the recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee regarding compensation payments were ignored in the Mining (Gove Peninsula Nabalco Agreement) Ordinance 1968 (NT), which unilaterally revoked part of the Yirrkala Aboriginal reserve in order to enable Nabalco to develop the mine.\\r\\nThe Aboriginal clans whose traditional lands were affected by the Gove project were so strongly opposed to the making of the Mining (Gove Peninsula Nabalco Agreement) Ordinance 1968 (NT) that they challenged it in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in 1968 in Milurrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd and Commonwealth of Australia; the \\"Gove land rights case\\". In 1971 Justice Richard Blackburn held that the ordinances and mining leases were valid and that the Yolgnu people were not able to establish their native title at common law. Justice Blackburn used the notion of terra nullius to justify this ruling, stating that the \\"doctrine of communal native title does not form and never has formed, part of the law of any part of Australia\\".[6]\\r\\nThe Milirrpum decision had wide ranging impacts on relations between Aborigines and the mining industry generally throughout Australia.[7] In response to the Milirrpum decision, in 1973 the Whitlam federal Labor government established the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, headed by Justice Edward Woodward, to inquire into \\"the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to the land, and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land\\".[8]","input":"Who was involved in the yirrkala bark petition?"},{"output":"Qin Shi Huang","context":"","input":"What dynasty commissioned the great wall of china?"},{"output":"xylem","context":"Vascular tissue is a complex conducting tissue, formed of more than one cell type, found in vascular plants. The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue: the vascular cambium and the cork cambium. All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant.\\r\\nThe cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes. The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue differentiates in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant. The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called vascular bundles. These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells. In stems and roots, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem. In the stems of some Asterales dicots, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.\\r\\nBetween the xylem and phloem is a meristem called the vascular cambium. This tissue divides off cells that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length. As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout. In trees and other plants that develop wood, the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem. The cork cambium gives rise to thickened cork cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss. Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of secondary growth.\\r\\nIn leaves, the vascular bundles are located among the spongy mesophyll. The xylem is oriented toward the adaxial surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the abaxial surface of the leaf. This is why aphids are typically found on the underside of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.[citation needed]","input":"What are the 2 types of vascular tissue?"},{"output":"Mahatma Gandhi","context":"Harijan Sevak Sangh is a non-profit organisation founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 to eradicate untouchability in India, working for Harijan or Dalit people and upliftment of scheduled castes of India.[1] It is headquartered at Kingsway Camp in Delhi, with branches in 26 states across India.[2] Prof. Sankar Kumar Sanyal is its present president.[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Second Round Table Conference, British government agreed to give Communal Award to the depressed classes on the request of B.

They have a cream to yellow coloured \\"bib\\" marking on their throats.\\r\\nTheir habitats are usually well-wooded areas. European pine martens usually make their own dens in hollow trees or scrub-covered fields. Martens are the only mustelids with semi-retractable claws. This enables them to lead more arboreal lifestyles, such as climbing or running on tree branches, although they are also relatively quick runners on the ground. They are mainly active at night and dusk. They have small rounded, highly sensitive ears and sharp teeth adapted for eating small mammals, birds, insects, frogs, and carrion. They have also been known to eat berries, birds' eggs, meat, nuts and honey. European pine martens are territorial animals that mark their range by depositing feces (called 'scats') in prominent locations. These scats are black and twisted and can be confused with those of the fox, except that they reputedly have a floral odor.[1]\\r\\nAlthough they are preyed upon occasionally by golden eagles, red foxes, wolves and wildcats, humans are the largest threat to pine martens. They are vulnerable from conflict with humans, arising from predator control for other species, or following predation of livestock and the use of inhabited buildings for denning. Martens may also be affected by woodland loss.[2] Persecution (illegal poisoning and shooting) by gamekeepers, loss of habitat leading to fragmentation, and other human disturbance have caused a considerable decline in the pine marten population. They are also prized for their very fine fur in some areas. In the United Kingdom, European pine martens and their dens are offered full protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Environmental Protection Act 1990.[3]\\r\\nIn Great Britain, the species was for many years common only in northwestern Scotland.[4] A study in 2012 found that martens have spread from their Scottish Highlands stronghold, north into Sutherland and Caithness and southeastwards from the Great Glen into Moray, Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, Tayside and Stirlingshire, with some in the Central Belt, on the Kintyre and Cowal peninsulas and on Skye and Mull. The expansion in the Galloway Forest has been limited compared with that in the core marten range. Martens were reintroduced to the Glen Trool Forest in the early 1980s and only restricted spread has occurred from there.[2]\\r\\nIn England, pine martens are extremely rare, and long considered probably extinct. A scat found at Kidland Forest in Northumberland in June 2010 may represent either a recolonisation from Scotland, or a relict population that has escaped notice previously.[5] There have been numerous reported sightings of pine martens in Cumbria, however, it was not until 2011 that concrete proof ÿ some scat that was DNA-tested ÿ was found.[6] In July 2015 the first confirmed sighting of a pine marten in England for over a century was recorded by an amateur photographer in woodland in Shropshire.[7] In July 2017, footage of a live pine marten was captured by a camera trap in the North York Moors in Yorkshire. [8][9]\\r\\nThere is also a small population of pine martens in Wales. Scat found in Cwm Rheidol forest in 2007 was confirmed to be from a pine marten using DNA testing. A male was found in 2012 as road-kill near Newtown, Powys. This was the first confirmed sighting in Wales of the species, living or dead, since 1971.[10] The Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) has begun a reinforcement of these mammals in the mid-Wales area. During autumn 2015, twenty pine martens were captured in Scotland, in areas where there is a healthy pine marten population, under licence from Scottish Natural Heritage. These animals were translocated and released in an area of mid-Wales. All of the martens were fitted with radio-collars and are being tracked daily to monitor their movements and find out where they have set up territories. During autumn 2016, the VWT will capture and release another twenty pine martens in the hope of creating a self-sustaining population.[11]\\r\\nThe marten is still quite rare in Ireland, but the population is recovering and spreading; its traditional strongholds are in the west and south, especially The Burren, but the population in the Midlands has significantly increased in recent years.[12] A study managed by academics at Queens University Belfast, using cameras and citizen scientists, published in 2015, showed that pine martens were distributed across all counties of Northern Ireland.[13]\\r\\nThe recovery of the European pine marten has been credited with reducing the population of invasive gray squirrels in the UK and Ireland.[14][15] Where the range of the expanding European pine marten population meets that of the grey squirrel, the population of the grey squirrels quickly retreats and the red squirrel population recovers. It is theorized that because the gray squirrel spends more time on the ground than the red squirrel, which co-evolved with the pine marten, they are far more likely to come in contact with this predator. Generally, the diet of the pine marten includes small mammals, carrion, birds, insects, and fruits.[16]\\r\\nThe European pine marten has lived to 18 years in captivity, but in the wild a lifespan of eight to ten years is more typical. They reach sexual maturity at two or three years of age.[citation needed] Copulation usually occurs on the ground and can last more than 1 hour.[17] The young are usually born in March or April after a 7-month-long gestation period in litters of one to five. Young European pine martens weigh around 30 grams at birth. The young begin to emerge from their dens by the middle of June and are fully independent around six months after their birth.[citation needed]\\r\\nTracks on mud.\\r\\nTracks on snow.","input":"What type of animal is a pine marten?"},{"output":"Daniel B. \\"Dan\\" Ryan Jr.","context":"Daniel B. \\"Dan\\" Ryan Jr. (1894ÿ April 8, 1961) was a Chicago insurance broker and served as President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners from 1954 to his death.

It is a collaboration between Disney Interactive and Square Enix, and is under the direction of Tetsuya Nomura, a longtime Square Enix character designer.\\r\\nKingdom Hearts is a crossover of various Disney settings based in a universe made specifically for the series. The series primarily centers on the main character Sora and his journey and experiences with various Disney, Final Fantasy and The World Ends with You characters, whilst stopping the various incarnations of the primary antagonist Xehanort throughout the series. All characters original to the Kingdom Hearts franchise are owned by The Walt Disney Company.\\r\\nThe series consists of eight games across multiple platforms, and future titles are planned. Most of the games in the series have been both positively received and commercially successful. As of October 2013, the Kingdom Hearts series has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.[1] A wide variety of related merchandise has been released along with the games, including soundtracks, figurines, companion books, novels and manga series.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Kingdom Hearts III will be the end of the \\"Dark Seeker Saga\\" centered on Xehanort, it has already been decided where certain characters will end up, in order to potentially continue their story in future games.[44]\\r\\nBoth Square Enix and Disney have released a wide variety of Kingdom Hearts merchandise including toys, figurines, clothing, and jewelry.[49][50] Two of the games, Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II, had a soundtrack released to coincide with the video games.[51][52] These were followed by a nine CD complete set which featured both soundtracks and unreleased tracks.[53] Kingdom Hearts has been adapted as a trading card game by the Tomy corporation of Japan.[54] An English version of the game was released in November 2007 by Fantasy Flight Games.[55] The video games have also been adapted into manga and novel series.\\r\\nLike the Final Fantasy games, a series of \\"Ultimania\\" books were released in Japan for many of the games. These books include game walkthroughs, interviews, and extra information from the developers. Kingdom Hearts -Another Report- was released along with Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ and features game information, visuals by Shiro Amano, and a director interview.[56] In North America, Brady Games released strategy guides for each game. For Kingdom Hearts II, they released two versions, a standard version and a limited edition version. The limited edition was available in four different covers and included a copy of Jiminy's Journal along with 400 stickers.[57]\\r\\nA manga based on the Kingdom Hearts storyline has been released in Japan and the United States. The story and art are done by Shiro Amano, who is also known for his manga adaptation of the Legend of Mana video game. The story follows the events that took place in the video games with differences to account for the loss of interactivity a video game provides. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square Enix's Monthly Shnen Gangan and eventually released in tankbon format. The first tankbon was released in Japan in October 2003.[58] The manga was released in the USA by Tokyopop two years later in October 2005.[59] Yen Press now holds the rights to publish the books for the USA market. The first series, Kingdom Hearts, consists of four volumes, while the second series, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, has two volumes. The third series, Kingdom Hearts II, has had five volumes published and is currently on hiatus. A fourth series based on Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is being serialized. The games have also been adapted as a light novel series, written by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. Like the manga series, it is divided into separate series based on the games. Kingdom Hearts is divided into two volumes; \\"The First Door\\"[60] and \\"Darkness Within\\".[61] Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is divided into two volumes. Kingdom Hearts II is divided into four volumes; \\"RoxasSeven Days\\",[62] \\"The Destruction of Hollow Bastion\\",[63] \\"Tears of Nobody\\",[64] and \\"AnthemMeet Again/Axel Last Stand\\".[65]\\r\\nKingdom Hearts features a mixture of familiar Disney, Pixar and Square Enix characters, as well as several new characters designed and created by Nomura.[66] In addition to original locations, the Kingdom Hearts series features many worlds from Disney films. Sora must visit these worlds and interact with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies. Often, his actions in these worlds closely follow the storylines of their respective Disney films. The main characters try not to interfere with the affairs of other worlds, as it could negatively affect the universe's order.[67][68] Moogles, small creatures from the Final Fantasy series, are another common element in the games. They provide the player with a synthesis shop in order to create and purchase items used in the game. The main cast from The World Ends with You also makes an appearance in the series in Dream Drop Distance, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III will feature characters from Pixar's Toy Story series.[69][70]\\r\\nThe series starts with Kingdom Hearts, where a 14-year-old boy named Sora is separated from his friends Riku and Kairi when their world, Destiny Islands, is invaded by creatures known as the Heartless. During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade that allows him to fight the Heartless. He soon arrives in another world, Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king, Mickey Mouse.[71][72] The three band together and travel to different Disney-themed worlds, sealing the hearts of the worlds to prevent more Heartless from devouring the hearts of those worlds as they search for their companions. Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the Princesses of Heart, and use their power to open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds.[73][74] Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover a sentient Heartless named Ansem to be the true orchestrator of the worlds' destruction. The three defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts, but remain separated from Riku and King Mickey while Kairi remains home to await her friends' return. \\r\\nIn Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Sora, Donald and Goofy's search for Riku and Mickey leads them to Castle Oblivion,[75] a fortress controlled by a mysterious group of non-existent \\"Nobodies\\" called Organization XIII, who use the power of a girl named Namin to manipulate the trio's memories. After defeating the Organization, the three are put to sleep for a year by Namin to allow them to regain their memories, though they must lose the memories of their experience in Castle Oblivion.[76] Meanwhile, Riku arrives in the basement of the castle and ascends to the surface with the aid of Mickey. Discovering Sora's sleeping state, Riku helps Namin keep him safe until he is awoken. In Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, a snag in the plan over the year forces Riku to capture RoxasSora's Nobody, who is born when Sora briefly becomes a Heartless in the first gamein order to enable Sora's reawakening.\\r\\nIn Kingdom Hearts II, Sora and friends awaken from their sleep and resume their search for Riku and King Mickey, learning of the Nobodies and becoming re-familiarized with Organization XIII. Sora once again travels to many Disney-themed worlds and resolves issues caused by the Heartless and Nobodies, and Maleficent's servant Pete. They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII and Nobody of Xehanort, revealed to be the human form of the Heartless Ansem.[77][78] The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain their lost hearts by creating their own version of Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all the hearts released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade. The three arrive at the headquarters of Organization XIII and team up with their friends. Ansem the Wise uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power,[79] but it self-destructs, engulfing Ansem. At the top of the Castle that Never Was, Sora and his friends battle Xemnas.[80] After Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, they get trapped in the realm of darkness, but a letter from Kairi summons a gateway for them, and the two are reunited with their friends at their home.[81]\\r\\nSometime later, Sora, Riku, and Kairi receive a letter from King Mickey. The letter, which was discovered by Mickey during the events of Kingdom Hearts Coded, describes the parts of their past that Namin learned while restoring Sora's memory.[82] As they read the letter, they learn about the fates of three Keyblade wielders at the hands of Xehanort during the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep (a decade before Kingdom Hearts): Terra is possessed by Xehanort; Ventus, whom Xehanort attempts to turn into the legendary -blade, sacrifices his heart to stop him and hides it within a four-year-old Sora's; and new Keyblade Master Aqua ends up trapped in the realm of darkness after sacrificing herself to save Terra.[83] King Mickey also discovers that the destruction of \\"Ansem\\" and Xemnas has led to the reconstruction of Xehanort.[84] To combat the new threat Xehanort poses, Sora and Riku take an exam to attain the Mark of Mastery that will allow them to become Keyblade Masters themselves.[85]\\r\\nDuring the test in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, Sora and Riku enter the realm of sleep, where they encounter a young version of Xehanort with the ability to travel through time.[86] The two Keyblade wielders also learn of Xehanort's true goal: assembling thirteen vessels and incarnations of himself (Organization XIII) and pitting them against seven hearts of pure light (the Princesses of Heart) in an ultimate battle to recreate the -blade.[87][88][89] Sora is narrowly saved from becoming Xehanort's final vessel, and Riku learns about data Ansem the Wise had implanted within Sora during his year-long sleep, which may be used to save those connected to Sora.[90] At the end of the exam, Riku is declared a Keyblade Master, and Sora embarks on a new journey alone to train.[91][92] In the meantime, to defend the Princesses of Heart from Xehanort, Yen Sid assembles any available Keyblade users to combat Xehanort's thirteen vessels in the upcoming final battle.[93]\\r\\nThe Kingdom Hearts games contain elements of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown in the form of a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives. The games feature real-time combat that incorporates physical attacks, magic, and summonings, though each game handles battles differently. The game also allows for items to be used on the field of battle to heal oneself or one's party members.\\r\\nGummi Ships are another common element of the series, which serve as the main mode of transportation between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title.[94] Most games also feature a journal which is accessible from the main menu. This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler.[95] In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.\\r\\nThe games are influenced by their parent franchise, Final Fantasy,[96] and carry its gameplay elements over into their own action-based, hack-and-slash system. Like many traditional role-playing games, Kingdom Hearts features an experience point system which determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player gains experience which culminates in a \\"level-up\\", where the characters grow stronger and gain access to new abilities.[97] The amount of experience is shared with all party members and each character grows stronger as experience is gained.[98]\\r\\nThe music for the series has been primarily composed by Yoko Shimomura. Kaoru Wada works as the arranger for orchestral music, including orchestral renditions of the main vocal themes and the ending themes.[99][100] The orchestral music was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra.[99][100] Soundtracks were released for the first and third installments following the release of their respective games. A compilation soundtrack was later released that included soundtracks for the entire series, including reworked tracks for the re-released Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories.[53][101]\\r\\nWhile the themes for some of the Disney-based worlds are taken directly from their Disney film counterparts,[100] most of them are given entirely original musical scores. In addition to each world having unique background music, each is given its own battle theme rather than having a common theme to cover all fights. Several of the main characters have themes, and the final boss of each game has several themes played in the various phases of those fights. The fights with Sephiroth feature a modified version of Nobuo Uematsu's \\"One-Winged Angel\\" from Final Fantasy VII.[101]\\r\\nThe main theme songs for the Kingdom Hearts games were written and performed by Japanese pop star, Hikaru Utada. The two main themes are \\"Hikari\\", from Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories,[102] and \\"Passion\\", from Kingdom Hearts II.[103] Each song has an English counterpart, \\"Simple and Clean\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" respectively, for the North American and European releases. Utada was the only singer Tetsuya Nomura had in mind for the first Kingdom Hearts theme song.[104] This marked the first time Utada had produced a song for a video game. Both theme songs reached notable popularity in Japan. On weekly Oricon charts, \\"Hikari\\" reached No. 1 in 2002 and \\"Passion\\" reached No. 4 in 2005.[105][106]\\r\\nThe initial idea for Kingdom Hearts began with a discussion between Shinji Hashimoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi about Super Mario 64.[107] They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like Super Mario 64 but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney's could rival a Mario game. Tetsuya Nomura, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct.[107] A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevatorSquare and Disney had previously worked in the same building in Japanallowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney.[108][109] Development began in February 2000 with Nomura as director and Hashimoto as producer.[110] While Nomura had done previous work in the Final Fantasy series as monster designer and graphic director, he did not gain widespread recognition until he was the lead character designer for Final Fantasy VII. Kingdom Hearts marked his transition into a directorial position, though he also served as the game's character designer. Scenarios were provided by Kazushige Nojima who was a scenario writer for Square from Final Fantasy VII until he left in 2003. Originally the development focused on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney's target age range. After Kingdom Hearts executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the Final Fantasy series, he began to develop the story further.[111] In June 2013, Nomura stated the name of the game came from him thinking about Disney Theme Parks, especially Animal Kingdom. However, Nomura could not get the IP with just \\"Kingdom\\", so the development team began to think about \\"heart\\" as a core part of the story, so they decided to combine the two to form \\"Kingdom Hearts\\".[112][113]\\r\\nNomura placed a secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts in hopes that fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt that if they did not, then it would be best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained.[114] After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, development for Kingdom Hearts II began.[115] There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more;[114] Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role.[111] Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed.[116] Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.[117]\\r\\nThough Disney gave Nomura freedom in the characters and worlds used for the games, he and his staff tried to stay within the established roles of characters and boundaries of the worlds.[118] Nomura has stated that though many of the Disney characters are not normally dark and serious, there were not many challenges making them so for the story, and despite this, their personalities shine because they maintain their own characteristics.[119] He also felt managing and keeping multiple worlds was problematic.[120] When deciding which worlds to include in the game, the development staff tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting and made an effort to minimize any overlap in the overall look and feel of each world.[111][121]\\r\\nThe inclusion of specific Final Fantasy characters was based on the opinions of both fans and staff.[122] Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe.[123] Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters.[124] For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff.[122] Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still be happy with it.[114]\\r\\nThe first Kingdom Hearts was announced at E3 in May 2001.[66] Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive, and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Nomura and include Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless.[66][125] On May 14, 2002, a press release announced a list of the English voice actors. The list included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced into the game. It was also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films.[66][126]\\r\\nA secret trailer in the first Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts Final Mix hinted at the possibility of a sequel. Rumors for a sequel on the PlayStation 2 were spurred in Japan when a Japanese video game site, Quiter, stated that \\"an internal (and anonymous) source at Square Japan\\" confirmed that development of Kingdom Hearts II had begun.[127] It was not until Kingdom Hearts II was announced, along with Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003 that rumors were confirmed.[128] Initial details were that it would take place some time after Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, which takes place directly after the first game. Other details included the return of Sora, Donald, and Goofy, as well as new costumes. At the 2004 Square Enix E3 press conference, the producer, Shinji Hashimoto, stated that many mysteries of the first game would be answered.[129]\\r\\nTo help market the games, websites were set up for each game and demos were on display at gaming events. Each game in the main series was also re-released in Japan with additional content and served as canonical updates to the series.[130][131] The additional content foreshadowed later plot elements in the series. The rereleases of the main series games had the term \\"Final Mix\\" added after the title, while Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts Coded were re-released as Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories and Kingdom Hearts Re:coded and released on the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo DS, respectively, with 3D graphics, voice overs during some cutscenes, and new game content.[132][133]\\r\\nThe Kingdom Hearts series has been critically and commercially successful. As of March 2014, the series has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.[147] The three main games in the series all met with positive sales at the time of their releases. In the first two months since the North American release of Kingdom Hearts, it was one of the top three highest-selling video games.[148] Chain of Memories sold 104,000 units in 48 hours in Japan, a record for a Game Boy Advance title at the time.[149] Its positive debut sales placed it in the top spot of sales charts in Japan.[150] In the first month of its North American release, it was ranked 1st on GameSpot's ChartSpot for portable systems and 6th for all consoles.[151] Within three days of the Kingdom Hearts II release in Japan, it shipped 1 million copies, selling through within a month.[152][153] By the end of March 2006, the NPD Group reported that Kingdom Hearts II was the highest-selling console game in North America, with 614,000 copies.[154] In the month after its release in North America, Kingdom Hearts II sold an estimated 1 million copies.[155]\\r\\nThe games have also received high ratings and positive comments from reviewers. All of the main games in the series have scored a 36 out of 40 or higher from the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu, known for its harsh grading.[156][157][158] All six games have been praised for their visuals. Game Informer considers the series the eleventh \\"must-play PlayStation 2\\" series.[159] The individual games have also won several awards. GameSpot commented that the concept of mixing the serious elements of Final Fantasy with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded Kingdom Hearts \\"Best Crossover Since Capcom vs. SNK\\" in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards.[160] IGN named Kingdom Hearts \\"Best Art Style/Direction\\" in their 2003 list of \\"Best Looking Games on PS2\\".[161] G4 awarded it \\"Best Story\\" at their 2003 G-Phoria awards show.[162] Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Kingdom Hearts II \\"Best Sequel\\" of 2006.[163] It tied with Resident Evil 4 as Famitsu's Game of the Year 2005.[164] The manga series has also been well received. Several of the manga volumes were listed on USA Today's \\"Top 150 best sellers\\".[165][166][167] The highest ranked volume was Kingdom Hearts volume 4 at #73.[166] Every volume listed stayed on the list for at least two weeks; Kingdom Hearts volume 4 stayed the longest at four weeks.","input":"What was added in kingdom hearts final mix?"},{"output":"the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.","context":"The Spirit of St. Louis (Registration: N-X-211) is the custom-built, single engine, single-seat monoplane that was flown solo by Charles Lindbergh on May 20ÿ21, 1927, on the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight from Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, for which Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig Prize.[2]\\r\\nLindbergh took off in the Spirit from Roosevelt Airfield, Garden City, New York, and landed 33 hours, 30 minutes later at Aroport Le Bourget in Paris, France, a distance of approximately 3,600 miles (5,800?km).[3] One of the best known aircraft in the world, the Spirit was built by Ryan Airlines in San Diego, California, which at the time was owned and operated by Benjamin Franklin Mahoney who had purchased it from its founder, T. Claude Ryan, in 1926. The Spirit is now on permanent display in the main entryway's Milestones of Flight gallery at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficially known as the \\"Ryan NYP\\" (for New York to Paris), the single engine monoplane was designed by Donald A. Hall of Ryan Airlines and was named the \\"Spirit of St. Louis\\" in honor of Lindbergh's supporters from the St. Louis Raquette Club in his then hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. To save design time, the NYP was loosely based on the company's 1926 Ryan M-2 mailplane with the main difference being the 4,000 mile range of the NYP and, as a non-standard design, the government assigned it the registration number N-X-211 (for \\"experimental\\"). Hall documented his design in \\"Engineering Data on the Spirit of St. Louis\\" which he prepared for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and is included as an appendix to Lindbergh's 1953 Pulitzer Prize winning book, The Spirit of St. Louis.\\r\\nB.F. \\"Frank\\" Mahoney and Claude Ryan had co-founded the company as an airline in 1925 and the latter remained with the company after Mahoney bought out his interest in 1926, although there is some dispute as to how involved Ryan may have been in its management after selling his share. It is known, however, that Hawley Bowlus was the factory manager who oversaw construction of the Ryan NYP, and that Mahoney was the sole owner at the time of Donald A. Hall's hiring.\\r\\nThe Spirit was designed and built in San Diego to compete for the $25,000 Orteig Prize for the first non-stop flight between New York and Paris which Lindbergh would win in the single engine monoplane.[4] Hall and Ryan Airlines staff worked closely with Lindbergh to design and build the Spirit in just 60 days. Although what was actually paid to Ryan Airlines for the project is not clear, Mahoney offered to do it at cost. After first approaching several major aircraft manufacturers without success, in early February 1927, Lindbergh, who as a U.S. Air Mail pilot familiar with the good record of the M-1 with Pacific Air Transport, wired, \\"Can you construct Whirlwind engine plane capable flying nonstop between New York and Paris ...?\\"\\r\\nMahoney was away from the factory, but Ryan answered, \\"Can build plane similar M-1 but larger wings... delivery about three months.\\" Lindbergh wired back that due to competition, delivery in less than three months was essential. Many years later, Jon van der Linde, chief mechanic of Ryan Airlines, recalled, \\"But nothing fazed B.F. Mahoney, the young sportsman who had just bought Ryan.\\" Mahoney telegraphed Lindbergh back the same day: \\"Can complete in two months.\\"\\r\\nLindbergh arrived in San Diego on February 23 and toured the factory with Mahoney meeting factory manager, Bowlus, chief engineer Donald Hall, and sales manager A.J. Edwards. After further discussions between Mahoney, Hall and Lindbergh, Mahoney offered to build the Spirit for $10,580, restating his commitment to deliver it in 60 days. Lindbergh himself contributed $2,000 toward the cost of the Spirit that he had saved from his earnings as an Air Mail pilot for Robertson Aircraft Corporation.\\r\\nLindbergh was convinced: \\"I believe in Hall's ability; I like Mahoney's enthusiasm. I have confidence in the character of the workmen I've met.\\"[citation needed] He then went to the airfield to familiarize himself with a Ryan aircraft, either an M-1 or an M-2, then telegraphed his St. Louis backers and recommended the deal, which was quickly approved.\\r\\nMahoney lived up to his commitment. Working exclusively on the aircraft and closely with Lindbergh, the staff completed the Spirit of St. Louis 60 days after Lindbergh arrived in San Diego. Powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-5C 223-hp radial engine, it had a 14 m (46-foot) wingspan, 3?m (10?ft) longer than the M-1, to accommodate the heavy load of 1,610 L (425 gal) of fuel. In his 1927 book We, Lindbergh acknowledged the achievement of the builders with a photograph captioned \\"The Men Who Made the Plane\\", identifying: \\"B. Franklin Mahoney, president, Ryan Airlines\\", Bowlus, Hall and Edwards standing with the aviator in front of the completed aircraft.[5]\\r\\nLindbergh believed that multiple engines resulted in a greater risk of failure while a single engine design would give him greater range. To increase fuel efficiency, the Spirit of St. Louis was also one of the most advanced and aerodynamically streamlined designs of its era.\\r\\nLindbergh believed that a flight made in a single-seat monoplane designed around the dependable Wright J-5C \\"Whirlwind\\" radial engine provided the best chance of success. The Ryan NYP had a total fuel capacity of 450 U.S. gallons (1,700?L; 370?imp?gal) or 2,710 pounds (1,230?kg) of gasoline, which was necessary in order to have the range to make the anticipated flight non-stop. The fuel was stored in five fuel tanks, a forward tank (88 gallons), the main (209 gallons), and three wing tanks with a total of 153 gallons.[6] Lindbergh modified the design of the plane's \\"trombone struts\\" attached to the landing gear to provide a wider wheel base in order to accommodate the weight of the fuel.[7]\\r\\nAt Lindbergh's request, the large main and forward fuel tanks were placed in the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This arrangement improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine in the event of a crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum.[7] Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth.[8] Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.[7]\\r\\nLindbergh sat in a cramped cockpit which was 94?cm wide, 81?cm long and 130?cm high (36?in?G 32?in?G 51?in). The cockpit was so small, Lindbergh could not stretch his legs. The Spirit of St. Louis was powered by a 223-horsepower (166?kW), air-cooled, nine-cylinder Wright J-5C \\"Whirlwind\\" radial engine. The engine was rated for a maximum operating time of 9,000 hours (more than one year if operated continuously), and had a special mechanism that could keep it clean for the entire New York-to-Paris flight. It was also, for its day, very fuel-efficient, enabling longer flights carrying less fuel weight for given distances.[Note 1] Another key feature of the Whirlwind radial engine was that it was rated to self-lubricate the engine's valves for 40 hours continuously. Lubricating, or \\"greasing,\\" the moving external engine parts was a necessity most aeronautical engines of the day required, to be done manually by the pilot or ground crew prior to every flight and would have been otherwise required somehow to be done during the long flight.[9]\\r\\nThe engine was built at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson, New Jersey by a 24-year-old engine builder, Tom Rutledge, who was disappointed that he was assigned to the unknown aviator, Lindbergh. Four days after the flight, he received a letter of congratulations from the Wright management.[9][10]\\r\\nThe race to win the prize required time-saving design compromises, Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design.[11] This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him awake at various times during the flight.[12] The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom fitted to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.\\r\\nLindbergh also insisted that unnecessary weight be eliminated, even going so far as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map. He carried no radio in order to save weight and because the radios of the period were unreliable and difficult to use while flying solo. Also, although he was an airmail pilot, he refused to carry souvenir letters on the transatlantic journey, insisting that every spare ounce be devoted to fuel. The fuselage was made of treated fabric over a metal tube frame, while the wings were made of fabric over a wood frame. The plywood material that was used to build most of Lindbergh's plane was made at the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan.[13]\\r\\nA small, left-facing Indian-style swastika was painted on the inside of the original propeller spinner of the Spirit of St. Louis along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others.[Note 2] The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The propeller spinner that is on the Spirit of St. Louis now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.\\r\\nLindbergh's New York-to-Paris flight made him an instant celebrity and media star. In winning the Orteig Prize, Lindbergh stirred the public's imagination. He wrote: \\"I was astonished at the effect my successful landing in France had on the nations of the world. It was like a match lighting a bonfire.\\"[14] Lindbergh subsequently flew the Spirit of St. Louis to Belgium and England before President Calvin Coolidge sent the light cruiser Memphis to bring them back to the United States. Arriving on June 11, Lindbergh and the Spirit were escorted up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C., by a fleet of warships, multiple flights of military pursuit aircraft, bombers, and the rigid airship Los Angeles where President Coolidge presented the 25-year-old U.S. Army Reserve aviator with the Distinguished Flying Cross.[15]\\r\\nOn the same day, the U.S Post Office issued a commemorative 10-cent \\"Lindbergh Air Mail\\" stamp depicting the Spirit over a map of its flight from New York to Paris, and which was also the first stamp issued by the post office that bore the name of a living person.\\r\\nOver the next 10 months, Lindbergh flew the Spirit of St. Louis on promotional and goodwill tours across the United States and Latin America. Not long after his return to the U.S. Lindbergh met his old barnstorming pal, Bud Gurney (1906ÿ1982). He allowed Gurney to fly the Spirit on a short hop. Gurney gave his opinion to Lindbergh of how it handled in comparison to their old Jennies from 1923. Gurney is the only other person besides Lindbergh to have flown The Spirit of St. Louis.[16]\\r\\nJust one year and two days after making their first flight at Dutch Flats in San Diego, California, on April 28, 1927, Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis flew together for the final time while making a hop from St. Louis to Bolling Field, in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1928. There he presented his monoplane to the Smithsonian Institution where for more than eight decades it has been on display, hanging for 48 years (1928ÿ76) in the Arts and Industries Building and today hanging, since 1976, in the atrium of the National Air and Space Museum alongside the Bell X-1 and SpaceShipOne. At the time of its retirement, the Spirit had made 174 flights for a total of 489:28 flying time.[17]\\r\\nWhile in other respects the Spirit of St. Louis appears today much as it appeared on its accession into the Smithsonian collection in 1928, the gold color of the aircraft's aluminum nose panels is an artifact of well-intended early conservation efforts. Not long after the museum took possession of the Spirit, conservators applied a clear layer of varnish or shellac to the forward panels in an attempt to preserve the flags and other artwork painted on the engine cowling. This protective coating has yellowed with age, resulting in the golden hue seen today. Smithsonian officials have indicated that the varnish will be removed and the nose panels restored to their original silver appearance the next time the aircraft is taken down for conservation.[18] However, the Smithsonian has subsequently reversed this stance, deciding that the golden hue on its engine cowling will remain, as it is part of the aircraft's natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of vulcanization, are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration (conservation was also likely undertaken on the wheel assembly itself).[19][20]\\r\\nNYP-2, an exact duplicate of the Spirit of St. Louis, was built 45 days after the transatlantic flight, for the Japanese newspaper Mainichi. The NYP-2 carrying serial number 29 was registered as J-BACC and achieved a number of record-breaking flights early in 1928 before a crash ended its career.[21]\\r\\nAlthough Ryan capitalized on the notoriety of the NYP special, further developments were only superficially comparable to the Spirit of St. Louis. An offshoot of the Ryan B-1 Brougham emerged as a five-seater with the same J-5 engine but modified with a conventional cockpit layout and a shorter wingspan. Under the newly restructured B.F. Mahoney Company, further development continued with the six-place Model B-7 utilizing a 420?hp engine and the Model C-1 with the basic 220?hp engine. In 1928, Mahoney built a B-1X as a gift for Charles Lindbergh.[21][22]\\r\\nPilot Frank Hawks purchased a Mahoney Ryan B-1 Brougham (NC3009) with money from his wife, naming the plane the \\"Spirit of San Diego.\\" [23] In the aftermath of the media exposure surrounding Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, he flew to Washington with his wife on board to greet the triumphant Lindbergh. Due to the ensuing publicity, Hawks was hired by the Ryan Aircraft company to be its official representative. Hawks went on to tour the country, selling rides in the aircraft \\"like Lindy flew.\\"[24]\\r\\nShortly after the original Spirit was retired in April 1928, the Mahoney Aircraft Corporation presented Lindbergh with a Mahoney Ryan B-1 \\"Brougham\\".[25]\\r\\nThe Mahoney Ryan B-1 \\"Brougham\\" was also used as the basis of a reproduction of the Spirit of St. Louis. The reproduction was used in the 1938 Paramount film Men with Wings starring Ray Milland.[5]\\r\\nAll three reproductions from the Warner Bros. film The Spirit of St Louis (1956) have survived with B-153 on display at the Missouri History Museum, in St. Louis, B-156 is part of the collection at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and B-159 belongs to the Cradle of Aviation Museum located in Garden City, Long Island, New York, not far from the site of Roosevelt Field from which the original departed in 1927.[26] According to information at the Henry Ford Museum, their copy (B-156) was actually owned by James Stewart, who portrayed Lindbergh in the film. Stewart is credited as having donated the aircraft to the Henry Ford. Lindbergh was reputed to have flown one of the reproductions during the film's production, however, the connection to Lindbergh is now considered a myth.[27]\\r\\nOn the 40th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight, a new reproduction named Spirit 2 was built by movie stunt pilot Frank Tallman. It first flew on April 24, 1967 and appeared at the 1967 Paris Air Show where it made several flights over Paris. In 1972, Spirit 2 was bought for $50,000 by the San Diego Air & Space Museum (formerly San Diego Aerospace Museum) and placed on public display until it was destroyed by arson in 1978. The museum built a replacement named Spirit 3 which first flew on April 28, 1979; it made seven flights before being placed on display. In August 2003, the Spirit 3 was removed from display and was flown as a 75th Anniversary tribute to Lindbergh. The aircraft is now on display in the museum's rotunda.[28]\\r\\nThrough the efforts of both staff and volunteers, the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, Wisconsin produced two reproductions of the Spirit of St. Louis, powered by Continental R-670-4 radial engines, the first in 1977 (the first of which was to be based on a conversion from a B-1 Brougham; the aircraft proved to be too badly deteriorated to be used in that manner) to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lindberghs flight across the Atlantic Ocean and subsequent tour of the United States. This example is now on display in the main museum gallery. A second reproduction, started from scratch in 1977 and first flown in November 1990, continues to fly at air shows and commemorative events. Both of the EAA reproductions were registered under the original's N-X-211.[29]\\r\\nAnother airworthy reproduction was built by David Cannavo and first flown in 1979, powered by a Lycoming R-680 engine. In 1995, it was bought by Kermit Weeks for his Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida.[30]\\r\\nA reproduction of the Spirit (Registration ES-XCL), which had been built and certified in Estonia in 1997, was written off on May 31, 2003. Shortly after takeoff at an air show in Coventry, England, structural failure occurred, resulting in a fatal crash, killing its owner-pilot, Captain Pierre Holl?nder.[31] [Note 3][33]\\r\\nA recently completed Spirit reproduction, intended for airworthiness is owned by the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, Cole Palen (1925ÿ1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death, and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft maintenance manager Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project's start, with original, and still functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated  including the same basic type of earth inductor compass used by Lindbergh  matching the ones in the original Spirit at the NASM, with the goal of becoming the most authentic airworthy reproduction of the Spirit yet built.[34]\\r\\nThis reproduction aircraft successfully flew in early December 2015 in upstate New York, piloted by aircraft restorer/builder, Ken Cassens of Stone Ridge, New York. The aircraft made its public debut flight on May 21, 2016, the 89th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight.[35][36]\\r\\nA 90% static reproduction built in 1956 for The Spirit of St Louis film by studio employees is now on display at the Wings of the North Air Museum in Eden Prairie, MN.[28] In 1999, the San Diego Air & Space Museum built a non-flying example which was fitted with an original Wright J-5 engine.[28] A static reproduction of the Spirit of St. Louis was built in 2002 and is on display at St. Louis Lambert International Airport.[37] The Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum at Rantoul, Illinois also has a static reproduction built by museum volunteers.[28] Two reproductions are also found in Germany, one at the Frankfurt International Airport with the second in a private collection.[38] [Note 4]\\r\\nData from [40][Note 5]\\r\\nGeneral characteristics\\r\\nPerformance\\r\\nThe Spirit of St. Louis on display in the National Air and Space Museum\\r\\nLeft side of Spirit of St. Louis\\r\\nNose of the Spirit of St. Louis, with the Wright Whirlwind Radial engine visible\\r\\nThe nose of the Spirit of St. Louis\\r\\nThe tail of the Spirit of St. Louis\\r\\nUnder the tail of the Spirit of St. Louis\\r\\nSpirit of St. Louis spinner\\r\\nSpirit of St. Louis model\\r\\nSpirit of St. Louis model at San Diego International Airport\\r\\nThe nose of the Spirit of St. Louis is a golden color because of a well-intentioned but mistaken attempt by us to preserve the markings on the cowling.

The Rams franchise relocated from Los Angeles to St. Louis in 1995, which had been without a National Football League (NFL) team since the Cardinals moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1988. The Rams' first home game in St. Louis was at Busch Memorial Stadium against the New Orleans Saints on September 10, 1995, before the Trans World Dome (later the Edward Jones Dome, and now known as The Dome at America's Center) was completed for their November 12 game against the Carolina Panthers. Their last game played at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis was against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on December 17, 2015, which they won, 31ÿ23. The Rams' last game as a St. Louis-based club was on January 3, 2016, against the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium, where they lost in overtime 19ÿ16.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFor 22 of their 28 years the St. Louis Cardinals called Busch Memorial Stadium home after it opened in 1966, after spending their first six years in St. Louis at Sportsman's Park; they shared both stadiums with the baseball team of the same name. But the overall mediocrity of the Cardinals, combined with stadium issues, caused game attendance to dwindle. And once again the Bidwills, the family that owned the Cardinals, decided to move the team. (They had moved the team from Chicago to St. Louis in 1960.) The cities they looked at included Baltimore, Phoenix, New York City, and Jacksonville. Nonetheless, Cardinals fans were unhappy at losing their team, and Bill Bidwill, fearing for his safety, stayed away from several of the 1987 home games. Their last home game was on December 13, 1987, in which the Cardinals won 27ÿ24 over the New York Giants in front of 29,623 fans on a late Sunday afternoon.\\r\\nNot long after the 1987 season, Bidwill agreed to move to the Phoenix area on a handshake deal with state and local officials, and the team became the Phoenix Cardinals. They planned to play at Arizona State University's Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe on a temporary basis while a new stadium was being built. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, the savings and loan crisis derailed financing for the stadium, forcing the Cardinals to play at Arizona State for 18 years.\\r\\nPrior to the Rams' 1979 Super Bowl season, owner Carroll Rosenbloom drowned in an accident. His widow, Georgia Frontiere, inherited 70% ownership of the team. Frontiere fired her step-son, Steve Rosenbloom, and assumed total control of the franchise. As had been planned prior to Carroll Rosenbloom's death, the Rams moved from their longtime home at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to Anaheim Stadium in nearby Orange County in 1980. The move was necessitated in part by the fact that the Coliseum was difficult to sell out because of its abnormally large seating capacity (100,000), subjecting the team to the league's local-market TV blackout rule, whenever home games did not sell out. Also, Southern California's population patterns were changing; there was rapid growth in L.A.'s affluent suburbs (e.g., greater Orange County) and a decline in the city of Los Angeles' citizenship and earning power. Anaheim Stadium was originally built in 1966 as the home of the California Angels Major League Baseball franchise. To accommodate the Rams' move, the ballpark was reconfigured with luxury suites and enclosed to accommodate crowds of about 65,000 for football.\\r\\nIn 1982 the Coliseum was occupied by the Los Angeles Raiders (now the Oakland Raiders). The combined effect of these two factors was to force the Rams' traditional fan base to be split between two teams. Making matters even worse, at this time the Rams were unsuccessful on the field, while the Raiders were thrivingeven winning Super Bowl XVIII in 1983. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers won championships in 1980 and 1982 en route to winning five titles in that decade, the Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 1981 and 1988, and the Los Angeles Kings made a deep run in the 1982-83 NHL playoffs.\\r\\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the Rams' loss in the 1989 NFC Championship Game marked the end of an era. The Rams would not have another winning season in Los Angeles for the remainder of the century, and beyond. The first half of the 1990s featured four straight 10-loss (or worse) seasons, no playoff appearances and waning fan interest. The return of Chuck Knox as head coach (after his successful stints as head coach of the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks) would not boost the Rams' fortunes. Knox's run-oriented offense brought about the end of offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese's tenure in 1993. General manager John Shaw was perceived by some to continually squander NFL Draft picks on sub-standard talent. The offensive scheme was not only unspectacular to watch, but dull by 1990s standardsfurther alienating fans. One bright spot for the offense during this time would be running back Jerome Bettis, a bruising running back from Notre Dame. Bettis flourished in Knox's offense, running for 1,429 yards as a rookie and 1,025 in his sophomore effort.\\r\\nGeorgia Frontiere attempted to relocate the Rams to Baltimore, but her fellow owners turned that proposal down. Frontiere then sought to relocate the team to St. Louis. This move was initially voted down as well. The other owners (led by Buffalo's Ralph Wilson, the Jets' Leon Hess, the Giants' Wellington Mara, Washington's Jack Kent Cooke, Arizona's Bill Bidwill and Minnesota's John Skoglund) believed that the Rams' financial problems were caused by the Frontieres' mismanagement. When Frontiere threatened to sue the league, commissioner Paul Tagliabue acquiesced to Frontiere's demands. As part of the relocation deal, the city of St. Louis agreed to build a taxpayer-financed stadium, the Trans World Dome, and guaranteed that the stadium's amenities would be maintained in the top 25% of all NFL stadiums. Frontiere waived the clause after a 10-year threshold period passed, as the city implemented a later plan to improve the stadium.[1]\\r\\nThe move left many in the Los Angeles area, and many of those indifferent to the whole situation, embittered toward the NFL. That sentiment was best expressed by actor and ex-Ram Fred Dryer, who at the time said \\"I hate these people [the organization and its owner] for what they did, taking the Rams logo with them when they moved to St. Louis. That logo belonged to Southern California.\\" Steve Rosenbloom, general manager of the team during his father's tenure as owner, opined that teams come and go, but for a team to leave Los Angelesthe second largest media market in Americafor St. Louis (approximately the 18th-largest) was simply irresponsible and foolish, in spite of the notoriously fickle support of Los Angeles fans. With the Raiders moving from L.A. back to Oakland only a few months later, the NFL would have no franchise in Los Angeles for two decades, although the Coliseum was used for professional football in 2001 by the Los Angeles Xtreme of the now-defunct XFL.\\r\\nWhile the Rams dealt with stadium concerns in Los Angeles, efforts were under way to regain an NFL franchise in St. Louis to play in a new domed stadium slated to open in 1995. First, Anheuser-Busch scion Jim Orthwein tried, and ultimately failed, to move the New England Patriots to St. Louis. Then, despite being heavily favored along with Charlotte to win an expansion team, St. Louis lost to a group from Jacksonville, Florida. So certain, in fact, did it appear that St. Louis would gain an expansion franchise, that the team had a name selected?ÿ the Stallions?ÿ and T-shirts with the team's logo were made very briefly available for sale at a number of St. Louis area sports shops.\\r\\nJust before moving to St. Louis, the Rams fired Knox and hired Rich Brooks, longtime successful football coach at the University of Oregon, to replace him. The team played its first several games in St. Louis at Busch Stadium (the home of the NFL's St. Louis Cardinals from 1966 until 1987) as work was finished on their new home, the Trans World Dome. Brooks jettisoned Knox's run-oriented scheme in favor of a powerful air attack. Bettis all but disappeared from the offense, rushing for only 637 yards. Despite this, the Rams started off well, getting off to a 5ÿ1 start. However, a 44ÿ10 thumping by the 49ers in the last game at Busch Stadium sent the team into a downward spiral, and they ultimately finished 7ÿ9still the closest they came to contention since 1989. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of the season was that veteran offensive lineman and future Hall of Famer Jackie Slater played his 20th and final season with the team in its new St. Louis location.\\r\\nThe next three years would largely be a repeat of the Rams' last five years in Los Angeles. The team drafted highly touted Nebraska running back Lawrence Phillips with the sixth overall pick in the 1996 NFL Draft, making Bettis expendable. Bettis would be traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in exchange for draft picks, a move now seen as one of the most lopsided trades in professional sports history, strongly favoring the Steelers.[2] After regressing to 6ÿ10 in 1996, Brooks was replaced by Dick Vermeil. Vermeil had enjoyed success as the head coach of UCLA (where he won a Rose Bowl) and the Philadelphia Eagles, whom he had led to Super Bowl XV. However, Vermeil left the Eagles after an unsuccessful 1982 season, claiming burnout, and proceeded to spend much of the next decade and a half as a college football commentator for ABC Sports.\\r\\nVermeil's first two seasons as Rams coach were as unsuccessful as many of the preceding seasons. Phillips was cut from the team mid-season in 1997, cementing his status as a draft bust.\\r\\nThe Rams' struggles continued in 1998, with the team nearing the end of a decade in which it compiled a dismal winning percentage that exceeded only that of the Cincinnati Bengals among NFL teams.\\r\\nFinally in 1999, there appeared to be reason for hope as the Rams obtained quarterback Trent Green and running back Marshall Faulk in two separate trades. But in the preseason Green would blow out his anterior cruciate ligament and miss the entire season. A tearful Vermeil vowed that the Rams would \\"play good football\\" behind Green's backup, a 28-year-old former Arena Football League Iowa Barnstormers and NFL Europe Amsterdam Admirals player named Kurt Warner. However, most observers believed Green's injury set up the Rams for another long season of failure. Indeed, ESPN Magazine had predicted that the Rams would finish with the worst record in the league (even below that of the expansion Cleveland Browns).\\r\\nWarner's unexpected success was perhaps the biggest story of the 1999 NFL season. He proved to be the catalyst that would spark an explosive offense nicknamed \\"The Greatest Show on Turf\\", capturing the NFL MVP award at season's end. Green went on to become one of the most productive quarterbacks in the league after being acquired by Kansas City in 2001.[citation needed] The 1999 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award would go to Faulk.\\r\\nThe 1999 St. Louis Rams were also noted for a colorful celebration conducted by their offensive players in the end zone after scoring a touchdown. The celebration, which involved a group of players standing in a circle and swaying their arms as a football spun like a top in the center of the circle, was known as the \\"Bob 'N Weave.\\" This type of \\"premeditated and prolonged\\" display was shortly thereafter subject to \\"excessive celebration\\" penalties installed by the league.\\r\\nAfter finishing the 1999 season 13-3 (the franchise's second-best regular season record), the Rams started out the playoffs by defeating the Minnesota Vikings 49ÿ37 to achieve their first NFC championship game since 1989. The opponent would be the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who proved successful in shutting down the Rams' vaunted offense. Still, the Rams managed to win the game 11-6, with the one touchdown coming on Warner's 30-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl, who made an amazing one-handed catch. Proehl, a 10-year NFL veteran who was in the playoffs for the first time in his NFL career, said after the game \\"There are a lot of people who say there are 500 Ricky Proehls out there. I beg to differ.\\"\\r\\nThe Rams' opponent in Super Bowl XXXIV would be the Tennessee Titans, who, like the Rams, had recently relocated from a major metropolis (Houston, Texas) to a mid-sized city (Nashville, Tennessee). In a game that many consider the best Super Bowl ever, Tennessee played the Rams tough throughout, achieving a 16-16 tie with 2:12 left on an Al Del Greco field goal. On the next drive, Warner, who had been a clutch performer all season long, came through once again, connecting with Isaac Bruce for a 73-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the drive to give the Rams a 23-16 lead with 1:53 to play.\\r\\nTennessee then mounted a desperate, last-minute drive, reaching the St. Louis 10-yard line with six seconds left and no timeouts. Titans quarterback Steve McNair threw to Kevin Dyson on a slant. Dyson caught the pass at the 3-yard line but was stopped in a play known as \\"The Tackle\\"; Rams linebacker Mike Jones brought Dyson down just 18 inches shy of the goal line, ending the game and giving the Rams and coach Dick Vermeil their first Super Bowl victory. Warner was named Super Bowl MVP. Following the Rams' Super Bowl victory, Vermeil retired from football (though he came back in 2001 as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs) and was replaced by offensive coordinator (and apprentice) Mike Martz.\\r\\nIn Mike Martz's first year as Rams head coach, the defending-champion Rams started the season by winning their first six games as they went 7ÿ1 in the first half of the season. However, their season started getting ugly. They went 3ÿ5 during the last half of the season, including a three-game skid. They still managed to get into the playoffs with a 10ÿ6 record and the NFC's #6 seed, but had to face the NFC West champion New Orleans Saints, the #3 seed, in the Wild Card round. Playing at the Louisiana Superdome, the Rams' 24th-ranked defense yielded New Orleans a 31-7 lead, but the Rams valiantly fought back, scoring three straight touchdowns. However, the comeback fell short as the Saints triumphed 31-28, the first playoff win in New Orleans franchise history.\\r\\nIn 2001, the \\"Max Q\\" Rams went 14-2 (including a spectacular 8-0 on the road), led not only by a sensational offense (their third straight year of scoring 500 or more points), but a good defense as well, coached by Lovie Smith and led by Adam Archuleta. After easily handling Green Bay in the divisional playoffs, the Rams fought off a pesky Philadelphia Eagles team 29-24 to reach their second Super Bowl in three seasons. Their opponents in Super Bowl XXXVI would be the New England Patriots who, much as the Rams had had two years previous, had enjoyed a Cinderella playoff run, highlighted by a dramatic and controversial 16-13 divisional playoff win against the Oakland Raiders.\\r\\nThe talent-laden Rams appeared to be primed to become the first pro football dynasty of the 21st century. However, despite being a 14-point favorite, the Rams were dominated by the Patriots for most of the game. The Patriots chipped the Rams wideouts and running backs, disrupting their precision passing patterns. They also beat up Kurt Warner, forcing him into uncharacteristic mistakes, including an 47-yard touchdown interception return by Ty Law.\\r\\nIn the fourth quarter, the Rams mounted a comeback attempt. Two plays after an apparent game-clinching 95-yard fumble return by the Patriots was reversed on a penalty, Kurt Warner scored on a two-yard keeper to bring the Rams to within seven points, 17-10. After holding the Patriots on the next drive, the Rams were in much the same situation as they had been against Tennessee. Warner came through once again, quickly leading the Rams on a dramatic drive culminating in a 26-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Proehl. The extra point by Jeff Wilkins tied the game at 17 with 90 seconds left.\\r\\nWith the Patriots holding no timeouts and the Rams having seized the momentum, overtime seemed assured. Fox Sports commentator John Madden opined that the Patriots should run out the clock to end regulation time. But quarterback Tom Brady led the Patriots down the field, completing all but one pass (an intentional spike to stop the clock) before Adam Vinatieri's last-second 48-yard field goal defeated the Rams 20-17.\\r\\nSuper Bowl XXXVI later became part of the wider 2007 National Football League videotaping controversy, also known as \\"Spygate\\". The Boston Herald reported, citing an unnamed source, that the Patriots had taped the Rams' walkthrough practice prior to the game.[3] After further investigation, the league determined that no tape of the Rams' Super Bowl walkthrough was made,[4] and the Herald later issued an apology in 2008 for the article.[5]\\r\\nIn 2002, the Rams had a very disappointing 7-9 final record (after starting out 0-5). The silver lining was the emergence of young quarterback Marc Bulger, from West Virginia University, who, after Kurt Warner was injured, won every game in which he both started and finished. Though not as intriguing a story as Warner's emergence in 1999 (the season in which Trent Green was injured and Warner became the star quarterback), Bulger's emergence was a highlight of the Rams' 2002 NFL season, demonstrating Martz's knack for developing lightly regarded or overlooked players into top-quality, productive quarterbacks. Also, the Rams gained two new divisional rivals in the NFC West thanks to a league-wide realignment that created eight new divisions of four teams each. One of these new rivals, the Arizona Cardinals, played in St. Louis from 1960 until the end of the 1987 season, and the other, the Seattle Seahawks, returned to the NFC for the first time since their inaugural 1976 season.\\r\\nIn 2003, Warner lost the starting job to Bulger after suffering six fumbles in the season opener against the New York Giants.[clarification needed] Warner was released by the Rams in June 2004 and quickly signed a free agent contract with Giants, effectively ending the \\"Greatest Show on Turf\\" era.\\r\\nThe 2003 season saw the Rams go 12-4, winning the NFC West again. However, the Rams lost a crushing divisional-round defeat to the Carolina Panthers (29-23 in double overtime), who went on to become NFC champions.\\r\\nDuring the 2004 NFL Draft, the Rams used their first pick (24th overall) to select running back Steven Jackson from Oregon State.\\r\\nThe Rams began their 10th year in St. Louis at home, winning their home opener over the Arizona Cardinals 17-10. They then lost the next two games: to the eventual NFC South champion Atlanta Falcons 34-17, and to the New Orleans Saints at home 28-25 in overtime. The Rams got to 2-2 on the season with a 24-14 road victory over the San Francisco 49ers. In Week 5, they defeated the Seattle Seahawks 33-27 on the road, as Bulger connected with Shaun McDonald for the 52-yard winning score in overtime. Next came a home win over Tampa Bay, 28-21 before a road loss to the hapless Miami Dolphins, 31-14. Following a Week 8 bye, the Rams lost to the defending champion Patriots at home 40-22. The Rams then downed the Seahawks 23-12 but then lost their next games on the road, losing to the Buffalo Bills 37-17 and to the eventual NFC North champion Green Bay Packers 45ÿ17. The team rebounded with a 16-6 home win over the 49ers, but their playoff hopes continued to shrink with two more road losses, falling to the Carolina Panthers 20-7 and to the Cardinals 31-7. At 6-8, the Rams rallied for home wins against the Philadelphia Eagles (20-7) and the New York Jets (32-29 in overtime), snatching the NFC's #5 seed despite finishing with an 8-8 record.\\r\\nFor the Wild Card round, the Rams faced the Seahawks for the third time. The visiting Rams took the lead on a 17-yard Bulger touchdown pass to Cam Cleeland with just 2:11 left in regulation time and then held off the Seahawks on 4th and goal to earn a 27-20 victory. The Rams made NFL history by becoming the first team to go .500 (8-8) in the regular season and then win a playoff game. However, St. Louis was thrashed in the divisional round by the Atlanta Falcons 47-17.\\r\\nDuring the 2005 NFL Draft, the Rams used their first pick on OT Alex Barron from Florida State. They lost on the road in Week 1 to the 49ers, 28-25, but rebounded with a 17-12 road win over Arizona and former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner. The Rams won their Week 3 home opener against the Titans 31-27 before dropping three straight games. In Week 5, Martz was diagnosed with an infection in his heart, and Joe Vitt was named interim head coach. In Vitt's first game at the helm, Bulger sprained an AC joint in a loss to Indianapolis. Replacement quarterback Jamie Martin then led the team to home victories against the Saints (28-17) and Jaguars (24-21). After a Week 9 bye, Bulger returned but the Rams fell in Seattle 31-16. The Rams next lost a rematch to the Cardinals, with Bulger suffering another shoulder injury. Against Houston, Martin was knocked out of the game with a concussion, giving rookie Ryan Fitzpatrick his first playing time in the NFL. The Rams won 33ÿ27 in overtime on a 56-yard touchdown strike from Fitzpatrick to receiver Kevin Curtis. However, they lost their next four games. Martin and the Rams managed to end their disastrous season on a positive note, beating Dallas on the road in ESPN's final Sunday night game. Martz was fired at season's end.\\r\\nDespite having a talent-laden roster, the Rams' front-office dysfunction had traveled from California to Missouri. With team president John Shaw remaining in Los Angeles after the relocation, president of football operations Jay Zygmunt clashed with head coach Martz, including an incident in which Zygmunt prevented the ill Martz from phoning in a play to his offensive coordinator. Poor draft choices and mediocre records began to pile up for the once-budding dynasty as the post-Martz era found the Rams in chaos. Hoping to regain control within the franchise, the Rams hired former Dolphins offensive coordinator Scott Linehan as head coach on January 19, 2006.[6] On January 24, Jim Haslett, the former head coach of the Saints, signed a three-year deal as defensive coordinator.[7][8]\\r\\nFollowing the 2007 season, Georgia Frontiere died on January 18, 2008 after having owned the team for 28 years.[9] Ownership of the team passed to her son Dale \\"Chip\\" Rosenbloom and daughter Lucia Rodriguez.[10] Rosenbloom was named the new Rams majority owner.[11] Linehan was fired on September 29, 2008, after the team started the 0-4, and Haslett took over as interim head coach for the rest of the season. In late December, Shaw and Zygmunt both resigned and Billy Devaney was promoted to general manager.[12]\\r\\nSteve Spagnuolo was named head coach in January 2009. Spagnuolo had masterminded the Giants' defensive scheme that shut down the previously undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. As the 2009 season began, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh put in an offer to buy the Rams, but his controversial televised comments about Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb in 2003 led the league to force Limbaugh to drop his plans. In spite of his success with the Giants, Spagnuolo's first season as Rams head coach was terribly disappointing as the team went 1-15, beginning with a shutout at the hands of the Seahawks. The team's lone victory came in Week 8 over the 2-14 Detroit Lions. However, Spagnuolo was not fired after his poor first season.\\r\\nOn May 31, 2009, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that majority owners Rosenbloom and Rodriguez officially offered their majority share of Rams for sale. They retained the services of Goldman Sachs, a prominent investment banking firm, to help facilitate the sale of the Rams by evaluating bids and soliciting potential buyers.[13] The sale price was unknown, but at the time Forbes estimated the team's value at $929 million.[14] On the final day to do so, then-minority owner Stan Kroenke invoked his right of first refusal to buy the 60% of the team that he did not already own. The original intended buyer, Shahid Khan, would later acquire the Jaguars after the 2011 season. Pursuant to NFL rules, owners are prohibited from owning other sports teams in the same market. At the time of purchase, Kroenke, a real estate and sports mogul married to a Walmart heir (d/b/a Kroenke Sports Enterprises), owned the Denver Nuggets, the Colorado Avalanche, the Colorado Rapids, the Pepsi Center (home to the Nuggets and Avalanche) and Altitude Sports and Entertainment.[15] These interests violated the NFL's cross-ownership rule. Nevertheless, on August 25, 2010, NFL owners unanimously approved Kroenke as the owner of the franchise contingent upon his eventual divestment of his Colorado sports interests. Kroenke complied with the rule when he transferred ownership of the Nuggets, the Avalanche, the Pepsi Center and the Altitude to his son Josh.\\r\\nFor having the NFL's worst record at 1-15 in 2009, the Rams earned the #1 overall pick in the 2010 NFL Draft and used it to acquire University of Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford.\\r\\nBradford was the main focus of the 2010 offseason. In order to make room for the new QB, Keith Null and several other unproductive players were cut from the roster. The Rams lost their season opener against the Cardinals with Bradford throwing three interceptions, including one on the last play of the game. They recorded their first win by beating Washington and ending a 14-game home-losing streak in Week 3. In Week 4, the Rams ended a 10-game losing streak against Seattle, 20-3. After being trounced 44-6 by Detroit, they returned home in Week 6 to beat San Diego 20-17. Bradford continued to show promise through the season despite struggling from his inexperience. Despite a 7-8 record, the Rams had a chance to win the NFC West when they traveled to 6-9 Seattle for a prime-time matchup. However, the Seahawks won the game and the division, 16-6. Bradford went on to win the 2010 Offensive Rookie of the Year award.\\r\\nThe 2011 season started disastrously, with the Rams opening 0-6, finally winning an improbable victory over the Saints in Week 8. The team finished 2-14, with their only other win being a Week 10 victory over Cleveland. Bradford missed half the season with an ankle injury, and the Rams' offense was rated the worst in the league.\\r\\nAt the conclusion of a poor 2011, Spagnulo and nearly all of the coaching staff were fired except offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was asked by the New England Patriots to return during the playoffs (he had been an assistant coach there prior to his disastrous stint as Denver Broncos head coach in 2009). The Rams then hired head coach Jeff Fisher, who had led the Tennessee Titans in their Super Bowl XXXIV loss to the Rams 12 years earlier. Fisher would then influence the hiring of new GM Les Snead and an all-new coaching staff including offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer and defensive coordinator Gregg Williams. Williams was eventually suspended for the entire 2012 season for his part in the Saints bounty scandal.\\r\\nDespite the 2011 fiasco, the Rams continued with their plans to rebuild the team around Bradford and convinced the Redskins to give up two first-round draft picks and one second-round draft pick in exchange for the Rams' #2 overall pick. This moved the Rams down to the #6 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, which they in turn traded to Dallas, but were left with an abundance of others for future use. Following the draft, they signed undrafted Oregon State punter Johnny Hekker, who would become a Pro Bowl-caliber player.\\r\\nThe Rams started 2012 with low hopes, but the draft trade with Washington confirmed Bradford would be their quarterback of the future. The team then surprised some by starting off 3-2, their first winning record since 2006. They then lost three straight, but rebounded with a solid 4-4-1 finish, including a 24-24 road tie with eventual NFC champion San Francisco, to finish 7-8-1, a five-game improvement over 2011 and an impressive 4-1-1 record in the very competitive NFC West.\\r\\nIn 2013, the Rams finished with a 7-9 record. In the 2014 season, their 20th in St. Louis, the team would again miss the playoffs with a 6-10 record. Bradford missed the entire 2014 season with an injury, allowing Shaun Hill and Austin Davis opportunities at quarterback.\\r\\nOn March 10, 2015, the Rams were involved in a rare trade of starting quarterbacks as they traded Bradford along with a fifth-round pick in 2015 to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for the Eagles' Nick Foles along with a fourth-round pick in 2015 and a second round pick in 2016. Foles had a 14-4 record as starter and an impressive TD-INT ratio of 46-17, while Bradford had an 18-30-1 record. On the day of the 2015 draft the Rams traded Zac Stacy, the Rams' 2013 rushing leader, for a 7th round pick to the Jets.\\r\\nThe Rams opened their 2015 season at home against Seattle. In Foles' Rams debut, he threw for 297 yards and a touchdown. Following the dramatic win, Foles struggled against his former divisional rival, the Redskins as the Rams lost 24-10. Foles' accuracy improved the following week but he threw no touchdowns and his first interception as a Ram against the Steelers, dropping the team to 1-2. Following the two losses Foles bounced back, handing the unbeaten Cardinals their first loss of the season. After that game, Foles' problems with turnovers from 2014 started to show, as he completed 11 passes out of 30 for 141 yards, 1 touchdown, and a career-high 4 interceptions against the Green Bay Packers. On November 16, Foles was benched in favor of Case Keenum, who would start the remainder of the season.\\r\\nLeading the team through their turbulence was rookie RB Todd Gurley. Gurley was drafted 10th overall in the 2015 NFL Draft.[16] Gurley, who tore his ACL his November 2014, saw his rehabilitation go ahead of schedule and during the team's preseason, while he did not play, he practiced without pads on. Soon after, Gurley was medically cleared for full contact by St. Louis team physicians. On Sept 27, 2015, he made his NFL debut against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was eased into action and finished the game with 6 rushes for 9 yards. The following week, the Rams visited undefeated Arizona for an NFC west divisional matchup. Again Gurley started slow with just 2 yards at halftime, but rushed for 144 yards in the second half as the Rams edged the Cardinals 24-22. The next three games against the Packers, Browns, and 49ers would see Gurley rush for at least 128 rushing yards per game. He scored his first NFL touchdown on Oct 25th, 2015 against the Cleveland Browns. With 566 yards in his first four NFL starts, Gurley became the most prolific rusher in his first four NFL games since the AFLÿNFL merger.[17] In Week 15, Gurley became the third rookie in Rams history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season after Jerome Bettis and Eric Dickerson in the Rams 31-23 victory over the Buccaneers. and in their 23-17 victory over the Seattle Seahawks and becoming the second Rams rookie to rush for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns since Eric Dickerson in 1983.\\r\\nThe Rams played their final home game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, on December 17, 2015. While the Edward Jones Dome was not at sell out capacity, a sizeable group of Rams fans attended the game, holding signs that read \\"Keep the Rams in St. Louis.\\" Enthusiastic chants of \\"Keep the Rams\\" and \\"Kroenke Sucks\\" were heard during and after the game. Despite offensive production from Tampa Bay, the Rams still managed a 31-23 victory with Case Keenum throwing for 234 yards and 2 touchdowns, Todd Gurley rushing 48 yards, Tavon Austin rushing 32 yards and a touchdown, Kenny Britt receiving for 71 yards and 1 touchdown, and Jared Cook receiving for 64 yards. The Rams offense dominated this game as well the defense also put pressure on the Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston.\\r\\nOn December 22, 2015, Todd Gurley along with fellow Rams players Aaron Donald and Johnny Hekker were selected to be part of the 2016 Pro Bowl. Gurley was one of three rookies to be selected to the Pro Bowl, along with Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters and Seahawks wide receiver and kick returner Tyler Lockett. The Rams concluded their season with two road games in the West, winning 23-17 against the Seahawks and losing 19-16 in overtime against the 49ers. Overall, the team finished their final season in St. Louis with a 7-9 record.\\r\\nThe Rams and the St. Louis CVC began negotiating a deal to get the Rams' home stadium, the Edward Jones Dome, into the top 25 percent of stadiums in the league (i.e., top eight of 32 NFL teams, in reference to luxury boxes, amenities and overall fan experience). Under the terms of the lease agreement, the St. Louis CVC was required to make modifications to the Edward Jones Dome in 2005. However, then-owner Georgia Frontiere waived this provision, in exchange for cash that served as a penalty for the city's noncompliance. The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, did make changes to the scoreboard and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remained dark. The minor renovations which totaled about $70 million did not bring the stadium within the specifications required under the lease agreement, thus keeping the Dome in a state of uncertainty. On February 1, 2013, a three-panel arbitrator selected to preside over the arbitration process found that the Edward Jones Dome was not in the top 25 percent of all NFL venues, as required under the terms of the lease agreement between the Rams and the CVC. The arbitrator further found that the estimated $700 million in proposed renovations by the Rams was not unreasonable, given the terms of the lease agreement. Finally, the City of St. Louis was ordered to pay the Rams' attorney fees which totaled a reported $2 million.[citation needed]\\r\\nPublicly, no interest was expressed by city, county and state officials in providing further funding to the Edward Jones Dome, in light of those entities (and taxpayers) continuing to owe approximately $300 million on the facility. A resolution was not reached by the end of the 2014 NFL season; therefore, with the City of St. Louis remaining in non-compliance with its obligations under the lease agreement, the Rams were free to nullify the lease and change to a year-to-year lease. Months later, the Rams scheduled a game to be played in London, violating the Edward Jones Dome's terms of lease.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn January 31, 2014, both the Los Angeles Times and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Rams owner Stan Kroenke purchased approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the Forum in Inglewood, California for a purchase price rumored to be between $90 million and $100 million. Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Mr. Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. As an NFL owner, any purchase of land in which a potential stadium could be built must be disclosed to the league. Kroenke subsequently announced plans to build an NFL stadium on the site, in connection with the owners of the adjacent 238-acre Hollywood Park site, Stockbridge Capital Group.[18] This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California. The land had been originally intended for a Walmart Supercenter, but Walmart could not get the necessary permits to build it. Kroenke is married to Ann Walton Kroenke, who is a member of the Walton family, and many of Kroenke's real estate deals have involved Walmart properties.\\r\\nOn January 5, 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that Stan Kroenke and Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering up to develop a new NFL stadium on the Inglewood property owned by Kroenke. The project includes a stadium of 80,000 seats, and a performance venue of 6,000 seats, while reconfiguring the previously approved Hollywood Park plan for up to 890,000 square feet of retail, 780,000 square feet of office space, 2,500 new residential units, a 300-room hotel and 25 acres of public parks, playgrounds, open space and pedestrian and bicycle access. The stadium was projected to be ready by 2018.[18] In lieu of this, St. Louis countered with a stadium plan for the north riverfront area of downtown, with the hope of keeping the Rams in the city.[citation needed]\\r\\nOn February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium plan and the initiative, and construction began on the new stadium on December 21, 2015 on the former Hollywood Park site.[19][20][21]\\r\\nOn January 4, 2016, the St. Louis Rams filed for relocation to move to the Los Angeles area for the 2016 NFL season. They were among three teams (the others being the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers) that had filed for relocation to Los Angeles. All three franchises had previously played in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Weeks later, the NFL owners gathered in Houston for a meeting on January 12 to decide which teams, if any, would win relocation rights to Los Angeles. A few days before the scheduled owners meeting, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones suggested that the Rams and Chargers share Stan Kroenke's Los Angeles Entertainment Center. This suggestion was taken as a possible option discussed in the Houston meetings. During the Los Angeles meeting, the Committee on Los Angeles Opportunities, which consists of six NFL owners, favored the Carson project over the Rams' Inglewood project. However, in the first round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got the greater amount of votes (21) while the Carson project received far fewer (11). This, however, did not meet the required threshold of 24 votes. In the second round of voting, the Inglewood proposal got 20 votes while the Carson proposal got 12. After hours of trying to reach a compromise, the Rams succeeded and announced their relocation to Los Angeles, effectively ending the team's 21-year tenure in St. Louis. The Chargers organisation was given the first option to join the Rams after a year (if they failed to reach a new stadium deal with the city of San Diego); the Chargers exercised this option on January 12, 2017, making Los Angeles once again a two-NFL franchise city. (If the Chargers had declined to exercise this option, then the Raiders would have had this option).[22][23]\\r\\nNumbers that have been retired by the Rams (Includes Players who Played in St. Louis Only):","input":"What city are the rams football team from?"},{"output":"Kazimierz Pr܇szyski","context":"The movie camera, film camera or cine-camera is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on an image sensor or on a film. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images; each image constitutes a \\"frame\\". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the frame rate (number of frames per second). While viewing at a particular frame rate, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures together to create the illusion of motion.[1]\\r\\nSince the 2010s, film-based movie cameras have been largely replaced by digital movie cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn interesting forerunner to the movie camera was the machine invented by Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory in 1845. A photosensitive surface was drawn slowly past the aperture diaphragm of the camera by a clockwork mechanism to enable continuous recording over a 12- or 24-hour period. Ronalds applied his cameras to trace the ongoing variations of scientific instruments and they were used in observatories around the world for over a century.[2][3]\\r\\nThe very first patented film camera was the one devised by Wordsworth Donisthorpe in 1876. Another film camera was designed in England by Frenchman Louis Le Prince in 1888. An earlier 16 lens camera in 1887 at his workshop in Leeds. The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. After much trial and error, he was finally able to develop a single lens camera in 1888, which he used to shoot the first sequences of moving film in the world, including the Roundhay Garden Scene and Leeds Bridge. According to Adolphe Le Prince, who assisted his father at Leeds, Roundhay Garden was shot at 12 frame/s and Leeds Bridge at 20 frame/s.[4] His camera still exists with the National Media Museum in Bradford. He shot the film on celluloid with 1? inch width.\\r\\nAnother early pioneer was the British inventor William Friese-Greene. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of celluloid. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera. This was capable of taking up to ten photographs per second using perforated celluloid film. A report on the camera was published in the British Photographic News on February 28, 1890.[5] He gave a public demonstration in 1890 of his device, but the low frame rate combined with the device's apparent unreliability made an unfavourable impression.\\r\\nWilliam Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a Scottish inventor and employee of Thomas Edison, designed the Kinetographic Camera in 1891. The camera was powered by an electric motor and was capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanismthe first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.[6]\\r\\nThe Lumire Domitor camera was created by Charles Moisson, the chief mechanic at the Lumire works in Lyon in 1894. The camera used paper film of 35 millimeter width, but in 1895 the Lumire brothers shifted to celluloid film, which they bought from New-Yorks Celluloid Manufacturing Co. This they covered with their own Etiquette-bleue emulsion, had it cut into strips and perforated.\\r\\nIn 1894 the Polish inventor Kazimierz Pr܇szyski constructed a projector and camera in one, an invention he called the Pleograph.[7][8][9][10][11]\\r\\nDue to the work of Le Prince, Friese-Greene, Edison and the Lumire brothers, the movie camera had become a practical reality by the mid 1890s. The first firms were soon established for the manufacture of movie camera, including Birt Acres, Eugene Augustin Lauste, Dickson, Path frres, Prestwich, Newman & Guardia, de Bedts, Gaumont-Dmny, Schneider, Schimpf, Akeley, Debrie, Bell & Howell, Leonard-Mitchell, Ertel, Ernemann, Eclair, Stachow, Universal, Institute, Wall, Lytax, and many others.\\r\\nThe Aeroscope was built and patented in England in the period 1909-1911 by Polish inventor Kazimierz Pr܇szyski.[12] Aeroscope was the first successful hand-held operated film camera. The cameraman did not have to turn the crank to advance the film, as in all cameras of that time, so he could operate the camera with both hands, holding the camera and controlling the focus. This made it possible to film with the Aeroscope in difficult circumstances including from the air and for military purposes.[13]\\r\\nThe first all-metal cine camera was the Bell & Howell Standard of 1911-12. One of the most complicated models was the Mitchell-Technicolor Beam Splitting Three-Strip Camera of 1932. With it, three colour separation originals are obtained behind a purple, a green, and a red light filter, the latter being part of one of the three different raw materials in use.\\r\\nIn 1923 Eastman Kodak introduced a 16mm film stock, principally as a lower cost alternative to 35mm and several camera makers launched models to take advantage of the new market of amateur movie-makers. Thought initially to be of inferior quality to 35mm, 16mm cameras continued to be manufactured until the 2000s by the likes of Bolex, Arri and Aaton.\\r\\nDigital movie cameras for digital cinematography are digital video cameras that capture digitally rather than the historically used movie camera, which shoots on film stock. Different digital movie cameras output a variety of different acquisition formats. Cameras designed for domestic use have also been used for some low-budget independent productions.\\r\\nSince 2010s, digital movie camera has become the dominant type of camera in the motion picture industry.\\r\\nMost of the optical and mechanical elements of a movie camera are also present in the movie projector. The requirements for film tensioning, take-up, intermittent motion, loops, and rack positioning are almost identical. The camera will not have an illumination source and will maintain its film stock in a light-tight enclosure. A camera will also have exposure control via an iris aperture located on the lens. The righthand side of the camera is often referred to by camera assistants as \\"the dumb side\\" because it usually lacks indicators or readouts and access to the film threading, as well as lens markings on many lens models. Later equipment often had done much to minimize these shortcomings, although access to the film movement block by both sides is precluded by basic motor and electronic design necessities. Advent of digital cameras in reduced the above mechanism to a minimum removing much of the shortcomings.\\r\\nThe standardized frame rate for commercial sound film is 24 frames per second. The standard commercial (i.e., movie-theater film) width is 35 millimeters, while many other film formats exist. The standard aspect ratios are 1.66, 1.85, and 2.39 (anamorphic). NTSC video (common in North America and Japan) plays at 29.97 frame/s; PAL (common in most other countries) plays at 25 frames. These two television and video systems also have different resolutions and color encodings. Many of the technical difficulties involving film and video concern translation between the different formats. Video aspect ratios are 4:3 (1.33) for full screen and 16:9 (1.78) for widescreen.\\r\\nMultiple cameras may be placed side-by-side to record a single angle of a scene and repeated throughout the runtime. The film is then later projected simultaneously, either on a single three-image screen (Cinerama) or upon multiple screens forming a complete circle, with gaps between screens through which the projectors illuminate an opposite screen. (See Circle-Vision 360) convex and concave mirrors are used in cameras as well as mirrors.\\r\\nOne of the problems in film is synchronizing a sound recording with the film. Most film cameras do not record sound internally; instead, the sound is captured separately by a precision audio device (see double-system recording). The exceptions to this are the single-system news film cameras, which had either an opticalor latermagnetic recording head inside the camera. For optical recording, the film only had a single perforation and the area where the other set of perforations would have been was exposed to a controlled bright light that would burn a waveform image that would later regulate the passage of light and playback the sound. For magnetic recording, that same area of the single perf 16?mm film that was prestriped with a magnetic stripe. A smaller balance stripe existed between the perforations and the edge to compensate the thickness of the recording stripe to keep the film wound evenly.\\r\\nDouble-system cameras are generally categorized as either \\"sync\\" or \\"non-sync.\\" Sync cameras use crystal-controlled motors that ensure that film is advanced through the camera at a precise speed. In addition, they're designed to be quiet enough to not hamper sound recording of the scene being shot. Non-sync or \\"MOS\\" cameras do not offer these features; any attempt to match location sound to these cameras' footage will eventually result in \\"sync drift\\", and the noise they emit typically renders location sound recording useless.\\r\\nTo synchronize double-system footage, the clapper board which typically starts a take is used as a reference point for the editor to match the picture to the sound (provided the scene and take are also called out so that the editor knows which picture take goes with any given sound take). It also permits scene and take numbers and other essential information to be seen on the film itself. Aaton cameras have a system called AatonCode that can \\"jam sync\\" with a timecode-based audio recorder and prints a digital timecode directly on the edge of the film itself. However, the most commonly used system at the moment is unique identifier numbers exposed on the edge of the film by the film stock manufacturer (KeyKode is the name for Kodak's system). These are then logged (usually by a computer editing system, but sometimes by hand) and recorded along with audio timecode during editing. In the case of no better alternative, a handclap can work if done clearly and properly, but often a quick tap on the microphone (provided it is in frame for this gesture) is preferred.\\r\\nOne of the most common uses of non-sync cameras are the spring-wound cameras used in hazardous special effects, known as \\"crash cams\\". Scenes shot with these have to be kept short, or resynchronized manually with the sound. MOS cameras are also often used for second unit work or anything involving slow or fast-motion filming.\\r\\nWith advent of digital cameras, synchronization became a redundant term, as both visual and audio is simultaneously captured electronically.\\r\\nMovie cameras were available before World War II often using the 9.5 mm film format. The use of movie cameras had an upsurge in popularity in the immediate post-war period giving rise to the creation of home movies. Compared to the pre-war models, these cameras were small, light, fairly sophisticated and affordable.\\r\\nAn extremely compact 35?mm movie camera Kinamo was designed by Emanuel Goldberg for amateur and semi-professional movies in 1921. A spring motor attachment was added in 1923 to allow flexible handheld filming. The Kinamo was used by Joris Ivens and other avant-garde and documentary filmmakers in the late 1920s and early 1930s.[14][15]\\r\\nWhile a basic model might have a single fixed aperture/focus lens, a better version might have three or four lenses of differing apertures and focal lengths on a rotating turret. A good quality camera might come with a variety of interchangeable, focusable lenses or possibly a single zoom lens. The viewfinder was normally a parallel sight within or on top of the camera body. In the 1950s and for much of the 1960s these cameras were powered by clockwork motors, again with variations of quality. A simple mechanism might only power the camera for some 30 seconds, while a geared drive camera might work for as long as 75 ÿ 90 seconds (at standard speeds).\\r\\nThe common film used for these cameras was termed Standard 8, which was a strip of 16 millimetre wide film which was only exposed down one half during shooting. The film had twice the number of perforations as film for 16?mm cameras and so the frames were half as high and half as wide as 16?mm frames. The film was removed and placed back in the camera to expose the frames on the other side once the first half had been exposed. Once the film was developed it was sliced down the middle and the ends attached, giving 50-foot (15?m) of Standard 8 film from a spool of 25-foot (7.6?m) of 16?mm film. 16?mm cameras, mechanically similar to the smaller format models, were also used in home movie making but were more usually the tools of semi professional film and news film makers.\\r\\nIn the 1960s a new film format, Super8, coincided with the advent of battery operated electric movie cameras. The new film, with a larger frame print on the same width of film stock, came in a cassette which simplified changeover and developing. Another advantage of the new system is that they had the capacity to record sound, albeit of indifferent quality. Camera bodies, and sometimes lenses, were increasingly made in plastic rather than the metals of the earlier types. As the costs of mass production came down, so did the price and these cameras became very popular.\\r\\nThis type of format and camera was more quickly superseded for amateurs by the advent of digital video cameras in 2000s. Since 2010s, amateurs increasingly started preferring smartphone cameras.[citation needed]","input":"When was the first hand held camera invented?"},{"output":"Mastiff","context":"The Perro de Presa Canario, A.K.A. the Canary Mastiff, is a large Molosser-type dog breed originally bred for working livestock. The name of the breed is Spanish, means \\"Canarian catch dog\\", and is often shortened to \\"Presa Canario\\" or simply \\"Presa\\". The breed is sometimes also called Dogo Canario, meaning \\"Canarian Molosser\\". It is the animal symbol of the island of Gran Canaria.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst introduced[when?] to the world outside of Spain's Canary Islands by the American anthropologist Dr. Carl Semencic in an article for Dog World Magazine and in his books on the subject of rare breeds of dogs,[citation needed] the Presa Canario or \\"Canary Dog\\" is a large-size dog with a thick and muscular body.[3] The head is broad, massive, square, and powerful brachycephalic shape. Proper head and good expression are part of the breed standard, and are manifest in the best breed specimens. The ears are normally cropped, both to create a more formidable expression and to prevent damage while working with cattle. If cropped, the ears stand erect. In countries where ear-cropping is banned, the ears are close fitting to the head; they hang down and should be pendant or \\"rose\\" shaped. The upper lip is pendulous, although not excessively. Seen from the front, the upper and lower lips come together to form an inverted V. The flews are slightly divergent. The inside of the lips is a dark colour.[4]\\r\\nMales have a standard desirable height range of 23 to 26 inches (58 to 66?cm)[5] at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 100 pounds (45?kg)[5] and a maximum weight of 65 kilograms (143?lb).[4] Females have a standard desirable height between 22 to 25 inches (56 to 64?cm)[5] at the withers, with a minimum weight at maturity of 85 pounds (39?kg)[5] and a maximum weight of 120 pounds (55?kg).[4]\\r\\nThe breed is also characterized by a sloping topline (with the rear being slightly higher than the shoulders). Another characteristic of the breed is the shape of the paws (cat foot) and the catlike movement of the animal. The body is mesomorphic, that is, slightly longer than the dog is tall, contributing to the feline movement.\\r\\nThe historian Agustn Millares Torres, in his \\"General History of the Canary Islands\\", said the derivation of large dogs that in these islands were [incomplete]. According to his research, these dogs took part in the myths, funeral customs and even gastronomy of the natives (Guanches) of the islands. Demons appeared to these people as big fleecy dogs, known as \\"Tibicenas\\" in Gran Canaria and \\"Irnene\\" on the island of La Palma. In the funerary cults, the dogs appear mummified beside their owners guides to the afterlife. The dogs were also consumed in small amounts, as has been proven in archaeological discoveries.[6]\\r\\nIn the aftermath of conquest, the presence of these dogs of molosser morphology on the islands is well documented, especially in the cedularios of the councils of Fuerteventura and Tenerife. The first quote after conquest dates from 1501, which allowed the puerqueros (pig farmers) have \\"one of the larges.\\" In many periods, these dogs were used to kill the wild dogs that attacked cattle. Success was credited by the presentation of the skins of the heads. In others periods, many of these dogs were ordered to be killed for the damage they did to cattle. At one point, residents were given the opportunity to kill loose and wild dogs without punishment. In other occasions the dogs were ordered to be bound. And still other times, due to the damage caused by these dogs, their possession was banned for anyone who was not a farmer or a hunter. All this occurred between the 16th and 18th centuries.[7]\\r\\nIn addition to the traditional role of cattledog, the Perros de Presa have been used for dog fighting. Until the 1950s it remained common practice in all the islands. There exists ample testimony from former fans. The owners agree if witnessed the fight in silence or could incite the animals. No spectator could touch or bother the dogs in combat. The most widespread method was to place the animals within a circle marked on the ground, face to face. The fight began when the collars were removed. These were not organized public events. Instead, they emerged sporadically at the challenge of the owners. However, practically the whole neighborhood participated in the show once it became aware of a fight. The fights were banned in the mid-1940s, but lasted for another decade. From this moment, due to tightening by the Francoist authority for the eradication of dogfighting, the Presa Canario is relegated to counted breeders that fortunately kept the breed preventing its total disappearance.[8]\\r\\nThe coat is short with no undercoating and slightly coarse to the touch. The coat comes in all shades of fawn and brindle.[9] The acceptance of the black coat is a point of contention among fanciers, as it is allowed by the AKC-FSS, UKC and UPPCC standards, but not by the FCI or FCI standards. White is allowed up to 20 percent[5] and is most commonly found on the chest and feet, and occasionally on a blaze on the muzzle. The breed standard requires black pigmentation and dogs should have a black mask that does not extend above the eyes. The breed is known[by whom?] for its minimal shedding.\\r\\nPresas require early socialization and obedience training.[10] In some situations, the Presa can be aggressive toward other dogs and suspicious of strangers.[11]\\r\\nAs a large breed, the Presa Canario can be susceptible to hip dysplasia. Other reported health problems include dilated cardiomyopathy- heart problems and mast-cell tumours - cancer patellar luxation and patellar evulsions, skin cysts, epilepsy, osteochondrodysplasias, demodectic mange and cryptorchidism and Canine leishmaniasis.[12] The latter condition is described empirically as highly likely to affect dogs in areas of Spain[13] and academically described as having increased over 22 years prior to 2006, with risk being highest for dogs that were older, large, lived outside, and lived at the meso-Mediterranean level.[14]\\r\\nThe average lifespan for the Presa Canario is between 8 and 12 years.[15]\\r\\nThe Presa Canario has a legislative basis in Spain in the form of recognition by a Real Decreto (Royal Decree) of the Ministro de Agricultura, Pesca y Alimentaci܇n (Minister of Agriculture Fishing and Nutrition), which was published in the Official Gazette of the Spanish Government ([BOE ÿ Boletin Oficial del Estado]). The original [Real Decreto 558/2001] can be read on the site of the Spanish Government Gazette. In the decree, the breed is referred to as \\"Presa Canario\\". A breed standard is attached in the Royal Decree and it includes having a black coat and specifies a maximum weight.\\r\\nAny other name or standard is not recognized by Spanish law.\\r\\nIn Spain there are two main organizations which are legally recognized by the Minister of Agriculture, Fishing and Nutrition (according to the requirements set by the [Real Decreto 558/2001]): the [RSCE] and the [FCE]. The term \\"legally recognized\\" means that these organizations have the power to inscribe the litters into the official Book of Origins of Spain (LOE ÿ Libro de Orgenes Espa?ol).\\r\\nThe FCE recognizes the breed according to Spanish law, and uses the Presa Canario name and standard, as set by the [Real Decreto 558/2001].\\r\\n[An official document] of the Spanish Government has been issued and sent to the RSCE to warn it and to invite it to modify its regulations.\\r\\nAnother recent legal source that identifies the breed is the [Real Decreto 1557/2005]. This decree also states the breed name as \\"Presa Canario\\" and gives the legislative power of official association recognition to the local governments.\\r\\nImportation and sale of the breed is prohibited in Australia[27] and New Zealand.[28]","input":"What breed of dog is a presa canario?"},{"output":"in 1887","context":"FrenchÿVietnamese relations started as early as the 17th century with the mission of the Jesuit father Alexandre de Rhodes. Various traders would visit Vietnam during the 18th century, until the major involvement of French forces under Pigneau de Bhaine from 1787 to 1789 helped establish the Nguy?n Dynasty. France was heavily involved in Vietnam in the 19th century under the pretext of protecting the work of Catholic missionaries in the country. France progressively carved for itself a huge colony, which would form French Indochina in 1887. France continued to rule Vietnam as a colony until France's defeat in the First Indochina War and the proclamation of Vietnam's independence in 1954.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first Frenchmen to visit Vietnam was the Jesuit father Alexandre de Rhodes,[1] who arrived there in 1620. While he was in Vietnam, he wrote the first Vietnamese Catechism and he went living\\r\\nAlexandre de Rhodes returned to Europe in 1650, to advocate the dispatch of bishops in order to better accompany the development of Roman Catholicism in Vietnam (at that time around 100,000 converts), and the dispatch of bishops in order to create a strong native clergy and avoid in Vietnam a catastrophic eradication of Christianity, as seen in the case of Christianity in Japan around 1620:[2]\\r\\n\\"We have all reason to fear that what happened to the Church of Japan could also happen to the Church of Annam, because these kings, in Tonkin as well as in Cochinchina, are very powerful and accustomed to war... It is necessary that the Holy See, by its own mouvement, give pastors to these Oriental regions where Christians multiply in a marvelous way, lest, without bishops, these men die without sacrament and manifestly risk damnation.\\"\\r\\nThe efforts of Alexander de Rhodes led to the creation of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, marking the involvement of Catholic France as a new missionary power in Asia. From 1660 a base was established in Ayutthaya, Siam, by Mgr Pallu and Mgr Lambert de la Motte, from where numerous attempts were made to send missionaries to Vietnam.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Jesuits continued their efforts in Vietnam. In 1658, Fathers Manoel Ferreira and Frenchman Joseph Tissanier arrived in Tonkin,[4] but they were expelled in 1664 under the rule of Tr?nh T?c, and fled to Ayutthaya.[5] In June 1666, the Ayutthaya base of the Paris Foreign Missions Society dispatched Father Fran?ois Deydier to Tonkin, who was able to reorganize Catholics there, although he remained in hiding.[6] Mgr Lambert de la Motte himself would also visit the mission in Tonkin in 1669 and reinforce the organization there, under cover of trading activities of the French East India Company.[6]\\r\\nIn 1680, the French East India Company opened a factory in Ph? Hi?n.[7] The famous Frenchman Pierre Poivre visited Vietnam from 1720.[7]\\r\\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the Tay S?n rebellion overthrew the Nguy?n family, but one of its members Nguy?n nh, future Emperor Gia Long, with the aid of the French Catholic priest Pigneau de Bhaine, titular bishop of Adran, obtained a treaty of alliance with the French king Louis XVI:[8] the Treaty of Versailles, signed on November 21, 1787.[9] In return Gia Long promised to cede Pulo-Condore to the French and to give a concession to the French in Tourane (modern Da Nang), as well as exclusive trading rights. That treaty marks the beginning of French influence in Indochina, but the Governor in Pondicherry, Count de Conway refused to follow through with the implementation of the treaty, leaving Pigneau de Bhaine to his own means.\\r\\nIn spite of these inconveniences, between 1789 and 1799, a French force mustered by Pigneau de Bhaine managed to support Gia Long in acquiring sway over the whole of Vietnam.[10] The French trained Vietnamese troops, established a navy, and built fortifications in the Vauban style,[8] such as the Citadel of Saigon or the Citadel of Duyn Khanh. Several of these French adventurers would remain in high positions in the government of Gia Long such as Philippe Vannier, Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, de Forsans and the doctor Despiau.\\r\\nThe death of Gia Long, and the accession of Emperor Minh M?ng in 1820 severely strained relations between France and Vietnam. In an effort to reestablish close contacts, Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau was nominated French Consul in Hu?. He offered a peace treaty, but remained unsuccessful, and left Vietnam definitively with Philippe Vannier and their families in December 1824. On 12 January 1825, an embassy led by Captains Hyacinthe de Bougainville and Courson de la Ville-Hlio arrived in ? N?ng, with the warships Thtis and Esprance.[11] Although they had numerous presents from the Emperor, and a 28 January 1824 letter from Louis XVIII, the ambassadors could not obtain an audience from Minh M?ng.[12]\\r\\nIn 1825, emperor Minh M?ng issued an edict prohibiting foreign missionaries in Vietnam, following the infiltration of Father Regreau from the Thtis when it was anchored in ? N?ng.[13] In his edict, Minh M?ng asserted that Christianity perverted the people:\\r\\n\\"The Westerner's perverse religion confuses the hearts of men. For a long time, many Western ships have come to trade with us and to introduce Catholic missionaries into our country. These missionaries make the people's hearts crooked, thus destroying our beautiful customs. Truly this is a great disaster for our land. Our purpose being to prevent our people from abandoning our orthodox way, we must accordingly completely eliminate these abuses.\\"\\r\\nAs the prohibition proved largely ineffective, and missionaries continued their activities in Vietnam, especially under the protection of the governor of Cochinchina L V?n Duy?t, a total ban on Roman Catholicism as well as French and Vietnamese priests was enacted following their support of the L V?n Kh?i revolt (1833ÿ1835), leading to persecutions of French missionaries and the execution of Father Joseph Marchand in 1835.[8][12] These events fed in France a desire to intervene and protect the Roman Catholic faith.\\r\\nFollowing the defeat of China by Great Britain in the Opium War, emperor Minh M?ng attempted to build an alliance with European powers by sending a delegation under the mandarin Ton That Tuong in 1840. They were received in Paris by Prime Minister Marshal Soult and the Commerce Minister, but they were shunned by King Louis-Philippe. This came after the Paris Foreign Missions Society and the Vatican had urged a rebuke for an \\"enemy of the religion\\". The embassy offered in vain a trade monopoly for France, in exchange for the promise of military support in case of an attack by another country.[14] An attempt to make a treaty with America also failed when Minh M?ng died in 1841.[12]\\r\\nMinh M?ng's successor, Thi?u Tr?, also upheld the anti-Catholic policy of his predecessor but tried to avoid direct confrontations. Captain Favin-Lvque, arriving in ? N?ng in 1840 on board the corvette Hro?ne, obtained from Thi?u Tr? the release of five imprisoned missionaries.[12]\\r\\nIn 1843, the French Foreign Minister, Fran?ois Guizot, sent a fleet to the East under Admiral Jean-Baptiste Ccille and Captain Charner, together with the diplomat Lagrene.[12] The move responded to the successes of the British in China in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.[15]\\r\\nIn 1845, Ccille was dispatched to Vietnam in order to obtain the release of Bishop Dominique Lefbvre, who had been condemned to death (the request for the intervention of the French Navy had been transmitted to Ccille by Captain John Percival of the USS Constitution).[12][16]\\r\\nIn 1847, Ccille sent two warships (Gloire and Victorieuse) under Captains Lapierre and Rigault de Genouilly to ? N?ng (Tourane) in Vietnam to obtain the liberation of two imprisoned French missionaries, Bishop Dominique Lefbvre (imprisoned for a second time as he had re-entered Vietnam secretly) and Duclos, and freedom of worship for Catholics in Vietnam.[17][18] As negotiations drew on without results, on April 15, 1847, a fight named the Bombardment of ? N?ng erupted between the French fleet and Vietnamese ships, four Vietnamese ships were sunk as a result. The French fleet then sailed away.[17]\\r\\nIn 1858, Charles Rigault de Genouilly attacked Vietnam under the orders of Napoleon III following the failed mission of diplomat Charles de Montigny. His stated mission was to stop the persecution of Catholic missionaries in the country and assure the unimpeded propagation of the faith.[19] Rigault de Genouilly, with 14 French gunships, 3,000 men and 300 Filipino troops provided by the Spanish,[20] attacked the port of ? N?ng in 1858, causing significant damages, and occupying the city. After a few months, Rigault had to leave the city due to supply issues and illnesses.[19]\\r\\nSailing south, De Genouilly then accomplished the Capture of Saigon, a poorly defended city, on 18 February 1859. De Genouilly was criticized for his actions and was replaced by Admiral Page in November 1859, with instructions to obtain a treaty protecting the Roman Catholic faith in Vietnam, but not to try to obtain territorial gains.[19] Due to the resumption of fighting in China during the Second Opium War, Admiral Page had to divert most of his force to China, to support Admiral Charner there. In April 1860, Page was recalled to France and replaced by captain dAries.[21] The Franco-Spanish force in Saigon, now only numbering about 1,000, was besieged by about 10,000 Vietnamese forces from March 1860 to February 1861.[21] Finally, following the French victory in China at the Battle of Palikao, reinforcements of 70 ships under Admiral Charner and 3,500 soldiers under General Vassoigne were dispatched to Saigon, so that the French were able to defeat the besieging Vietnamese at the battle of Chin Hoa (Ky Hoa) on 25 February 1861.[22] Admiral Bonnard forced the entrance of the Mekong river, and seized M? Tho.[23]\\r\\nOn 13 April 1862, the Vietnamese government was forced to negotiate and officially cede the territories of Bin Ha, Gia ??nh and ??nh T??ng to France in the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, confirmed by the Treaty of Hu? (1863).\\r\\nAn embassy was sent to France under Phan Thanh Gi?n in 1863, to try to recover the territories lost to France.[24] Although Napoleon III initially accepted Phan Thanh Gi?n's plea, the agreement was finally canceled in 1864, under pressure from Napoleon's cabinet led by the Minister of the Navy and the Colonies Chasseloup-Laubat.\\r\\nIn 1864, all the French territories in southern Vietnam were declared to be the new French colony of Cochinchina. In 1866, France started the exploration of the Mekong river, with the objective of reaching the riches of China, under Ernest Doudart de Lagre and Francis Garnier. They reached the Yunnan, discovering that the Mekong was not navigable as far as China. They found out instead that the Song-Ko? river in Tonkin would be a good alternative.[25]\\r\\nIn 1867 the provinces of Chau ??c, H Tin and V?nh Long were added to French-controlled territory by admiral La Grandire. Admiral Dupr became Governor of Cochinchina.[25] The Vietnamese Emperor formally recognized French dominion over Cochinchina in 1874, in the 1874 Treaty of Saigon,[26] negotiated by Paul-Louis-Flix Philastre.\\r\\nIn 1873, Francis Garnier was put in charge of an expedition to Tonkin, with the mission of protecting French interests there, following the troubles encountered by the French trader Jean Dupuis.[25] Garnier disembarked in Hanoi on 3 November 1873, but negotiations were not forthcoming. On November 20, Garnier made an assault of the Hanoi citadelle, and pacified the delta, with nine officers, 175 men and two gunboats.[25] The Black Flags resisted the French intrusion, entering into a guerrilla campaign that led to the killing of Garnier on 21 December 1873.[25]\\r\\nIn March 1882, Captain Henri Rivire again visited Hanoi with three gunboats and 700 men in order to obtain a trade agreement. Following some provocations, Rivire captured Hanoi in April 1882. Again the Black Flags counter-attacked, and Rivire was killed in May 1883 in the Battle of Paper Bridge, leading to a huge movement in favour of a massive armed intervention in France.[27] Credits were voted for, and a large force of 4,000 men and 29 warships (including 4 ironclads) was sent. Admiral Amde Courbet would be leading the force in Tonkin, while Admiral Meyer would operate in China.[27]\\r\\nFollowing a failed ultimatum, on 18ÿ19 August 1883, Courbet bombarded the forts of the capital of Hu?. The forts were occupied on the 20th. The gunboats Lynx and Vipre reached the capital. On August 25, the Vietnamese court accepted to sign the Treaty of Hu (1883),[27] A French protectorate over the remaining of Vietnam (Annam and Tonkin) was recognized through the treaty.[26][28][29]\\r\\nThe next objective of the French was to take full control of the Tonkin. In October 1883, Courbet was placed in command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. In December 1883, he led the S?n Tay Campaign against the Black Flags.[30] French casualties were heavy (83 dead and 320 wounded), but the Black Flags were very weakened as a result of the campaign.\\r\\nThe B?c Ninh Campaign (March 1884) was one of a series of clashes between French and Chinese forces in Tonkin (northern Vietnam) in the period. The campaign, which lasted from 6 to 24 March, resulted in the French capture of B?c Ninh and the complete defeat of China's Guangxi Army.\\r\\nChina, the traditional overlord of Vietnam, kept contesting French influence in the area and was supporting Annam as well as the Black Flags on its territory at the frontier with Tonkin.[30] Although a treaty had been signed between France and China (11 May 1884 the Tientsin Accord) promising Chinese evacuation from Tonkin, military confrontations continued as in the B?c L? ambush (June 1884). These tensions led to the Sino-French War (1884ÿ85), which ultimately forced China to totally disengage from Vietnam and confirmed the French possessions.\\r\\nFrench Indochina was officially formed in October 1887 from Annam, Tonkin, Cochinchina (which together form modern Vietnam) and the Kingdom of Cambodia following the Sino-French war (1884ÿ1885). Jean Antoine Ernest Constans became the first Governor-General of French Indochina on 16 November 1887. Laos was added after the Franco-Siamese War of 1893.\\r\\nThe federation lasted until 1954. In the four protectorates, the French formally left the local rulers in power, who were the Emperors of Vietnam, Kings of Cambodia, and Kings of Luang Prabang, but in fact gathered all powers in their hands, the local rulers acting only as heads.\\r\\nFrench stayed in Indochina during World War II, tolerated by the Japanese Army [31]\\r\\nVietnam obtained independence following the First Indochina War. In 1945, H? Ch Minh declared an independent Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which was recognized by the fellow Communist governments of China and the Soviet Union. Fighting lasted until March 1954, when the Vi?t Minh won the decisive victory against French forces at the grueling Battle of ?i?n Bin Ph?. This led to the partition of Vietnam into the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the north, under Vi?t Minh control, and the State of Vietnam in the south, which had the support of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. It was at the 1954 Geneva Conference that France relinquished any claim to territory in the Indochinese peninsula. Laos and Cambodia also became independent in 1954, but were both drawn into the Vietnam War.\\r\\nThe events of 1954 marked the end of French involvement in the region, and the beginnings of serious U.S. commitment. Tensions between North and South Vietnam led to the Vietnam War.\\r\\nFrance recognized North Vietnam and established diplomatic relations on April 12, 1973.[32]\\r\\nFran?ois Mitterrand became the first French President ever to visit Vietnam, at 1990, in order to increase cooperation between France and its former colony, Vietnam. Since then, France follows Vietnam seriously, due to the historical trace and the role of Vietnam in the Francophonie.","input":"When did vietnam first became a colony of france?"},{"output":"Double Gloucester","context":"\\r\\nCoordinates: 514948N 20929W? / ?51.82991N 2.15812W? / 51.82991; -2.15812\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake is an annual event held on the Spring Bank Holiday at Cooper's Hill, near Gloucester in England.[1]  It was traditionally held by and for the people who live in the local village of Brockworth, Gloucestershire, but now people from all over the world take part.

The nearest pubs to the event are The Cross Hands and The Victoria, both of which are in Brockworth, which competitors frequent for some pre-event Dutch courage or discussion of tactics and after the event for convalescence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ceremony originally took place each Whit Monday, before it later transferred to the Spring Bank Holiday. Two possible origins have been proposed for the ceremony. The first is said that it evolved from a requirement for maintaining grazing rights on the common[5].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second proposal is pagan origins for the custom of rolling objects down the hill. It is thought that bundles of burning brushwood were rolled down the hill to represent the birth of the New Year after winter. Connected with this belief is the traditional scattering of buns, biscuits and sweets at the top of the hill by the Master of Ceremonies. This is said to be a fertility rite to encourage the fruits of harvest[5].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first written evidence of cheese rolling is found from a message written to the Gloucester town crier in 1826, though even then it was apparent the event was an old tradition.[6] Each year, the event becomes more and more popular, with contestants coming from all across the world to compete, or even simply to watch.[1] In 1993, fifteen people were injured, four seriously, chasing cheeses down the one-in-three hill.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 24 March 2010, the organisers faced a backlash following an announcement of how the 2011 event would be run. The plans had been made to conduct the event under mounting pressure from the local council, who stipulated it should include security, perimeter fencing to allow crowd control, and spectator areas that would charge an entrance fee. The event proceeded without management.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"No-one's going to stop us doing it. They say it's not official, but we are all Brockworth people, and we're running the cheese today, so it is official. We strongly believe in it.\\"\\r\\nRichard Jefferies commented:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\"Since we announced an entry fee, we have been bombarded with so much hostility and criticism, much of it at a personal level, including accusations of profiteering, and some of the committee have even received threats.\\"\\r\\nThe 2011 event took place without management, due to safety concerns over the number of people visiting the event,[7] resulting in the 'Save the Cheese Roll' campaign.[8][9] Despite the cancellation and lack of paramedics, around 500 people showed up in 2011 to hold some spontaneous races; no major injuries were reported.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cheese currently used in the event is 7ÿ9 pounds (3.2ÿ4.1 kilograms) Double Gloucester, a hard cheese traditionally made in a circular shape.[10] Each is protected for the rolling by a wooden casing round the side, and is decorated with ribbons at the start of the race. Formerly, three cheeses were presented by parishioners, and the cheeses were usually rolled by them. A collection is usually made now to purchase them, as well as sweets, and also to provide prize money.[5] The current supplier is local cheesemaker Diana Smart and her son Rod,[4] who have supplied the cheese since 1988.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn May 2013, a police inspector warned the 86-year-old cheese maker Diana Smart that she could be held responsible for injuries.[4] Chief Superintendent Nigel Avron of Gloucestershire Police also made these comments: \\"If you are an organiser in some way or some capacity you could potentially be held liable for something that took place at that event\\".[4] In recent years, organisers of the event, have felt compelled to use a lightweight foam version for safety reasons. In the second race (2013) Australian  Caleb Stalder managed to catch the fake cheese and claim victory, despite being some way behind the leaders.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the steepness and uneven surface of Cooper's Hill, there are usually a number of injuries each year. A first aid service is provided by the local St John Ambulance (Gloucester, Cheltenham and Stroud Divisions) at the bottom of the hill. Members of the local rugby club and Young Farmers volunteer their services by acting as 'catchers' for any participants who lose their balance and also are on hand to carry down any casualties requiring first aid who do not reach the bottom. A number of ambulance vehicles attend the event, since there is invariably at least one and often several injuries requiring hospital treatment. As the event has evolved, an additional on-site professional medical cover is provided by another group of volunteers: 'Search And Rescue Aid In Disaster' (SARAID).\\r\\n\\r\\nCooper's Hill Cheese Rolling has been summarised by a previous participant as \\"twenty young men chasing a cheese off a cliff and tumbling 200 yards to the bottom, where they are scraped up by paramedics and packed off to hospital\\".[13] This quotation was reported in The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper of 13 November 2008, in an amusingly titled article 'Return to Edam'. The same article reports one Scottish competitor prodding another in the ribs at the top of the hill, quizzing him if his \\"travel insurance cover[s] this\\"?[13] The Australian author, Sam Vincent, \\"questions his sanity\\" as he is \\"crouched on the summit of a diabolical slope\\", alongside thirteen other competitors whilst they are \\"awaiting the call to start what is surely the world's most dangerous footrace\\".[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe notoriety of cheese rolling is widespread and its somewhat de facto tally of annual injuries has been the subject of much coverage in news and television programmes. Alongside reputable broadcasters such as the BBC Television reporting, the global sports magazine TV shows Gillette World Sport and Trans World Sport have both mused at the barmy activities and the ensuing injuries for many years.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second race in the 2004 event was won by New Zealand television personality and former international rugby player Marc Ellis.[14]\\r\\nIn 2018, soldier with 1st Battalion, The Rifles (1 Rifles), 30 year old Chris Anderson broke the all-time record of 22 wins in the men's races.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nAn annual cheese-rolling event has taken place in Chester since about 2002, to promote the town's food and drink festival. The rolling takes place on the flat down an obstacle course.[48] No injuries have been reported since 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BrockworthCheeseRoll/","input":"What type of cheese is used at coopers hill?"},{"output":"terracotta","context":"The Ashes urn is a small urn made of terracotta and standing 11?cm high, believed to contain the ashes of a burnt cricket bail. It was presented to Ivo Bligh, the captain of the England cricket team, as a personal gift after a friendly match hosted at Rupertswood mansion in Sunbury during the 1882ÿ83 tour in Australia. After his death the urn was presented to the Marylebone Cricket Club, which has it on display at Lord's cricket ground in London. The urn has come to be strongly associated with 'The Ashes', the prize for which England and Australia are said to compete in Test series between the two countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 29 August 1882 Australia defeated England in a cricket match played at Kennington Oval, London. There was a great deal of dismay felt by the English about this loss and a few days later a mock obituary notice written by Reginald Shirley Brooks appeared in the Sporting Times which read:\\r\\n\\"In affectionate remembrance of English Cricket which died at the Oval on 29 August 1882. Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances. RIP. NB. The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\\"[1] It was the first time the term 'the ashes' had been mentioned.\\r\\nIt had previously been arranged that a cricket team captained by Ivo Bligh would tour Australia in 1882-83 and this team became the English hope of victory. Before leaving England for Australia, Bligh pledged to bring back \\"The Ashes of English cricket\\".[2]\\r\\nThree main Test matches were played. The first was in Melbourne and was won by Australia. The second was also in Melbourne and won by the English. The third match was in Sydney and was again won by the English. After this it was generally acknowledged that the English were the victors.\\r\\nAfter the conclusion of the Test series, a match was played in Sydney in which a United Australian Eleven defeated The Hon. Ivo Bligh's Eleven by four wickets.[3] This seems to have given rise in Melbourne to some debate about whether it should have counted as a Fourth Test.[4] However, The Sydney Morning Herald made it very clear that this game was not part of the international \\"rubber\\" which had in fact been won by England.[5] There were also other matches played between the English and the individual State cricket teams over the tour.\\r\\nThe urn was made during the 1882-83 tour. It is a very small red terracotta artefact which some believe could be a perfume bottle. Two labels are pasted on it: the top label says \\"The Ashes\\"; the lower label is a verse cut out from Melbourne Punch magazine of 1 February 1883 which reads:\\r\\nThese names are some of the men in the English team. Many of them are shown in the pictures above.\\r\\nThere is also an associated red velvet bag with a Victors Olive Crown embroidered on it in yellow silk cotton with the emblem 1883 in the middle of it. This bag was made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, wife of the manager of the NSW team, in early 1883.[6]\\r\\nReports have established that the estate of Rupertswood in Sunbury, Victoria is the birthplace of the Ashes urn legend. According to a 1908 newspaper report in the Hobart Mercury, an unnamed writer from the \\"Westminster Gazette\\" recalled that a group of Melbourne ladies which included Janet, Lady Clarke, and Florence Morphy, presented \\"a tiny silver urn, containing what they termed 'the ashes of Australian (sic) cricket.'\\"[7] to The Hon. Ivo Bligh, captain of the English touring team after one of the three Tests in 1882-83.\\r\\nRupertswood was the home of Sir William Clarke and Janet, Lady Clarke. Sir William was president of the Melbourne Cricket Club. At Christmas 1882 and again at Easter 1883, the members of the English cricket team were his guests.[8]\\r\\nA divergent story about the presentation of the urn is that on Christmas Eve, prior to the start of the three-test series, and after a friendly match between the English cricketers and a combination of staff and guests held at Rupertswood, the urn was presented by Lady Clarke to Bligh in a joking fashion.[9] Also present on this occasion was the Clarkes' music teacher, Florence Morphy, who was later to marry Ivo Bligh.\\r\\nThere has been some disagreement with this version of events mainly because of three issues. Firstly the verse on the urn was not published in Punch until 1 February 1883 which is five weeks after the Christmas event. Secondly there are statements by both Lord Darnley and Lady Darnley that the presentation happened sometime after the Third Test.[10] The Third Test finished in Sydney on 30 January 1883. Thirdly the accompanying red velvet bag made by Mrs Anne Fletcher, was not made until early 1883.\\r\\nJoy Munns has taken these problems into account and has concluded that there were two quite separate presentations of the same urn. It was presented firstly at Rupertswood at Christmas and was merely the perpetuation of a joke. The second and most documented event was at Easter (which was around 25 March 1883) at Rupertswood after all the formal matches had finished. On this occasion Joy Munns says the verse was pasted on the urn, it was placed in the red velvet bag and given to Bligh.[11] Lady Clarke and Florence Morphy were both present on this occasion. This version of the presentation being in late March is supported by a statement made by Lord Darnley who said in 1921 that he was presented with the urn by \\"some ladies of Melbourne after the final defeat of his team\\".[12] England in fact won the series 2-1.[13] Bligh's 'final defeat' refers to a non-Test game in Melbourne on 12 March 1883 when they were defeated by the Victorian cricket team in the last formal match of the tour.[14]\\r\\nOver Easter many of the English team were guests at Rupertswood and did not embark on the return voyage to England until 29 March. Ivo Bligh stayed for another five weeks during which time it is believed he became engaged to Florence Morphy. He sailed for England on 5 May but returned to Australia in February 1884. Four days after his arrival, on 9 February,[15] he married Florence at St Mary's Church in Sunbury.[16] The wedding breakfast was a very lavish affair at Rupertswood.[17]\\r\\nAfter their honeymoon in Australia the couple went to England in August 1884 where they stayed at Cobham Hall. The English papers reported that Florence was warmly welcomed by the Bligh family on her arrival.[18] They remained in England for the next 18 months and then returned to Melbourne in January 1886. It was reported at this time that they intended to stay in Australia for about one year because of Ivo Blighs health.[19]\\r\\nIn Melbourne they lived in a house called Hazelwell in Powlett St East Melbourne and in November 1886 Florence had her first child.[20] In March 1887 the couple returned to England[21] and for some time lived at Cobham Hall.[22] In 1890 Bligh had a position in the wine merchant firm of Morgan Brothers.[23]\\r\\nIn 1900 after the death of his brother Bligh became the Earl of Darnley and inherited Cobham Hall. The Ashes urn remained at the Hall until Blighs death in 1927.\\r\\nLord Darnley had an interview in 1921 with Montague Grover, a well-known Australian journalist, at his home in Cobham Hall. Grover says that the urn was kept in Darnleys den where all his other treasured cricket memorabilia were placed. He had numerous photos of the other team players on the wall as well as a leather-bound copy of the original account of the 1882-83 cricket tour of Australia.[24]\\r\\nAfter Blighs death Florence presented the urn to the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1929. It was placed in the Long Room at the Lords Pavilion until 1953, when it was transferred to the Cricket Museum next to the Pavilion. A photo of the urn in the Long Room in 1929 is shown at the left.\\r\\nAfter the urn was first displayed at Lord's it produced a gradual change in the public perception of 'The Ashes'. In 1933 it was displayed in the National Sporting Trophies Exhibition in London with some of the worlds great sporting memorabilia. To the public the urn was becoming the image and symbol of 'The Ashes'.[25]\\r\\nIt was not until after about 1950 that the cricket books and paraphernalia almost exclusively used representation of the urn to depict 'The Ashes'. From about 1989 images of the Australian Test cricketers with replicas of the urn appeared in the media.\\r\\nSince 1929 the urn has returned to Australia only twice ÿ once when it was brought to Sydney for the Bicentenary Test Match in 1988 and secondly in 2006 for the tour of the Ashes Exhibition to each state capital of Australia.[26]\\r\\nhttp://www.heritageaustralia.com.au/downloads/pdfs/Heritage%200306_Clarkes%20Rupertswood.pdf","input":"What is the ashes trophy made out of?"},{"output":"tigers","context":"The informal term \\"big cat\\" is typically used to refer to any of the four largest (living) members of the entire Panthera genus. Among the five total species within the Panthera genus, these four are the only cats that are able to roar.[1] In descending order of their maximum potential size, these four species are: tigers, lions, jaguars, and leopards, with the tiger (Panthera tigris) being the largest.[1] A more liberal and expansive definition is sometimes used which may include the snow leopard, puma, clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard and/or cheetah, although these added species do not roar.[1]\\r\\nDespite enormous differences in size, various species of cat are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and efficient apex predators.[2] Their range includes the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus.[3] When air passes through the larynx on the way from the lungs, the cartilage walls of the larynx vibrate, producing sound. The lion's larynx is longest, giving it the most robust roar. All five extant members of the Panthera genus contain this elongated hyoid but due to differences in the larynx the snow leopard cannot roar.\\r\\nThe principal threats to big cats vary by geographic location, but primarily are habitat destruction and poaching. In Africa many big cats are hunted by pastoralists or government 'problem animal control' officers. Certain protected areas exist that shelter large and exceptionally visible populations of lions, hyenas, leopards, and cheetahs, such as Botswana's Chobe, Kenya's Masai Mara, and Tanzania's Serengeti. Rather, it is outside these conservation areas where hunting poses the dominant threat to large carnivores.[4]\\r\\nIn the United States, 19 states have banned ownership of big cats and other dangerous exotic animals as pets, and the Captive Wildlife Safety Act bans the interstate sale and transportation of these animals.[5] The initial Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA) was signed into law on December 19, 2003.[6] To address problems associated with the increasing trade in certain big cat species, the CSWA regulations were strengthened by a law passed on September 17, 2007.[7] The big cat species addressed in these regulations are the lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, cheetah, jaguar, cougar, and any hybrid combination any of these species (liger, tigon, etc) that results from breeding of these big cats. Private ownership of these big cats is not prohibited by this law but the law does make it illegal to transport, sell, or purchase them in interstate or foreign commerce. Although these regulations seem to provide a strong legal framework for controlling the commerce involving big cats, international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have encouraged the U.S. to further strengthen these laws. The WWF is concerned that weaknesses in the existing U.S. regulations could be unintentionally helping to fuel the black market for tiger parts.[8]\\r\\nAn animal sanctuary provides a refuge for animals to live out their natural lives in a protected environment. Usually these animal sanctuaries are the organizations which provide a home to big cats whose private owners are no longer able or willing to care for their big cats. However, use of the word sanctuary in an organization's name is by itself no guarantee that it is a true animal sanctuary in the sense of a refuge. To be accepted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as a bona fide animal sanctuary and to be eligible for an exemption from the prohibition of interstate movement of big cats under the Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA), organizations must meet the following criteria:[9]\\r\\nA 2010 study published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution has given insight into the exact evolutionary relationships of the big cats.[10] The study reveals that the snow leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and jaguar are more closely related to each other. The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats approximately 3.9 Ma. The tiger then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene epoch, approximately 3.2 Ma. The ancestor of the lion, leopard, and jaguar split from other big cats from 4.3ÿ3.8 Ma. Between 3.6ÿ2.5 Ma the jaguar diverged from the ancestor of lions and leopards. Lions and leopards split from one another approximately 2 Ma.[11] The earliest big cat fossil, Panthera blytheae, dating to 4.1?5.95 MA, was discovered in southwest Tibet.[12]\\r\\nSnow leopard\\r\\nTiger\\r\\nJaguar\\r\\nLion\\r\\nLeopard\\r\\nLion\\r\\nCheetah\\r\\nPuma / Cougar / Panther / Mountain lion\\r\\nLeopard\\r\\nSnow leopard\\r\\nLiger\\r\\nTigon\\r\\nTiger","input":"What is the largest type of big cats in the world?"},{"output":"1 July 2013","context":"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2013 enlargement of the European Union saw Croatia join the European Union as its 28th member state on 1 July 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country applied for EU membership in 2003, and the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004. Candidate country status was granted to Croatia by the European Council in mid-2004. The entry negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, began in October that year together with the screening process.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accession process of Croatia was complicated by the insistence of Slovenia, an EU member state, that the two countries' border issues be dealt with prior to Croatia's accession to the EU.  Croatian public opinion was generally supportive of the EU accession process, despite occasional spikes in euroscepticism.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia finished accession negotiations on 30 June 2011,[2] and on 9 December 2011, signed the Treaty of Accession. A referendum on EU accession was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012, with 66% of participants voting in favour of joining the Union.[3][4][5][6]  The ratification process was concluded on 21 June 2013, and entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU took place on 1 July 2013.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent referendums\\r\\n\\r\\nAccession requirements included: judicial reform to strengthen the independence, accountability, impartiality, professionalism and efficiency of the judiciary; a crackdown on corruption and organised crime (this resulted in the conviction of former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader for taking bribes); strengthen the protection of minorities; settle outstanding refugee return issues; improve the protection of human rights.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia had to extradite several of its citizens to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), a United Nations body, an issue that was often contentious in domestic politics. Croatia's relations with the ICTY had continually been cited by the EU officials as something that required further improvement. Ratification of the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia had been stalled because of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Council, after its summit of 20 December 2004, set the following 17 March as the date to start entry negotiations, provided that Croatia continued to co-operate fully with the ICTY. On 16 March 2005, the day before talks were to begin, the EU postponed the commencement of negotiations, because the ICTY prosecution assessed the Croatian efforts to capture the fugitive general Ante Gotovina (indicted by the ICTY for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but at large since 2001) as neither timely nor sufficient.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 7 December 2005, the Spanish police finally arrested Ante Gotovina with the help of the Croatian government on the Spanish island of Tenerife, located in the Canary Islands. He was brought to The Hague to be tried for war crimes. With the arrest of Ante Gotovina this issue was resolved, and entry negotiations began anew, after the certification of ICTY chief prosecutor Carla Del Ponte that Croatia now fully cooperated with the ICTY.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn April 2011, Croatian generals Gotovina and Marka? were given extended prison sentences at the ICTY, which was widely perceived as unjust in the Croatian public. This caused a marked increase in opposition to the accession because, in the past, some countries like the Netherlands,[9] conditioned their support for the Croatia's accession process with the continued Croatian co-operation with the ICTY.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 16 November 2012, the ICTY Appeals Chamber acquitted generals Gotovina and Marka? and ordered their immediate release.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia has had long-standing border issues with Slovenia, especially over the Piran Bay boundary. Between December 2008 and SeptemberÿOctober 2009, Slovenia blocked Croatia's EU accession over these border issues. On 6 June 2010, Slovenia voted to accept the ruling of United Nation arbitrators on the dispute, removing this obstacle.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia has border disputes with Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, but these countries are not European Union members and cannot directly block the accession process. In December 2008, Croatia and Montenegro agreed that the outstanding sea border issue between the two countries should be settled before an international court whose decision would be accepted in advance by the parliaments of the two countries.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nFree acquisition of real estate by foreigners is a sensitive issue in Croatia. This matter particularly concerns Italians, especially in Istria. While it has some ties with Italy, the events surrounding World War II, when Istria changed hands between the Kingdom of Italy and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, remain pertinent. Numerous Italian politicians expressed their discontent concerning the inability of Italians to purchase land in Croatia, considering it discriminatory treatment and stating that the issue should be resolved as soon as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia subsequently denied any discrimination, and said that Croatian legislation provided for the same treatment of all EU citizens concerning land ownership. In mid-2006, Croatia and Italy came to an agreement allowing Italian citizens to purchase land in Croatia and Croatian citizens to purchase land in Italy. Other EU members had to resolve similar issues before their accession to the EU. Examples of this include Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, and especially Malta.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia was required to stop subsidising its shipbuilding industry, resulting in privatisations, closures and reduced production capacity.[13][14]\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia applied for EU membership in 2003, and the European Commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004. Candidate country status was granted to Croatia by the European Council (the EU's heads of state and/or government) in mid-2004, but the date for the beginning of entry negotiations, while originally set for March 2005, was put off. In early March 2005, Croatia was formally warned by the EU that its failure to arrest the war crimes suspect Ante Gotovina would jeopardise the country's chances of starting the accession talks, in spite of Croatia insisting it was doing everything it could to find and arrest the fugitive[15] and claiming that Gotovina was no longer in Croatia.[16] In fact, the talks started in October 2005, shortly before Gotovina's arrest in Spain, which occurred in early December that year and was hailed by the EU as an important turning point for the whole region, as it turned \\"the page from the nationalist past to a European future\\".[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the start of negotiations with Croatia, the acquis was divided into 35 chapters, 4 more than the usual 31; the new chapters, previously part of the agricultural policy, are areas expected to be troublesome, as they were with the other applicants. Following the opening of accession negotiations on 3 October 2005, the process of screening 35 acquis chapters with Croatia was completed on 18 October 2006.[18] Negotiations had been restrained for ten months because of a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia.[19] In September 2009 it was announced that Slovenia would remove restraints on Croatia's negotiations with the EU without prejudice to the international mediation on the border dispute.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\n[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nOriginally Croatia had been aiming for a 2007 accession date, which would have broken Slovakia's record of 2.5 years of negotiations to complete the process. However, negotiations turned out to be tougher than expected. On 5 November 2008, the European Commission's annual progress report on Croatia's candidacy was published. Olli Rehn stated that the country should aim to complete accession negotiations by the end of 2009, with membership following by 2011 at the latest.[56] In 2009 it was also reported that Iceland may be fast-tracked into the European Union,[57] and Rehn said that \\"the EU prefers two countries joining at the same time rather than individually. If Iceland applies shortly and the negotiations are rapid, Croatia and Iceland could join the EU in parallel\\". The last non-acquis hurdle to membership, the maritime border dispute with Slovenia, was overcome in November 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia ultimately finished its accession negotiations on 30 June 2011,[58] and signed the Treaty of Accession 2011 in Brussels on 9 December 2011; followed by approval of it by a national referendum on 22 January 2012 and completing their ratification process on 4 April 2012. Entry into force and accession of Croatia to the EU took place on 1 July 2013, as all 27 EU members and Croatia have ratified the treaty before this date.[59][60]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accession took place at a time of economic difficulty with Croatia in a fifth year of recession with 21% unemployment, and amid the European sovereign-debt crisis.[61]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Croatia joined the EU, it exited the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia became a member on 1 July 2013, but some areas of cooperation in the European Union will apply to Croatia at a later date. These are:\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore accession to the European Union, Croatia was categorised as an Annex II country, which meant that Croatian citizens could stay in the Schengen Area without a visa for up to 90 days in a 180-day period. Croatian citizens were also able to stay without a visa in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania for up to 90 days in each country, as well as in the United Kingdom for up to 6 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general rule was that non-EU citizens had to use a passport to enter EU member states. However, there was an exception to the Schengen Agreement rules for Croatian citizens. Based on the pre-Schengen bilateral agreements between Croatia and neighbouring EU countries (Italy, Hungary and Slovenia), Croatian citizens were allowed to cross the border with only a Croatian national identity card (a passport was not obligatory).[62] Many people living near the border crossed it several times a day (some work across the border, or own land on the other side of the border), especially on the border with Slovenia, which was unmarked for centuries as Croatia and Slovenia were both part of the Habsburg Empire (1527ÿ1918) and Yugoslavia (1918ÿ1991). Prior to Croatia's accession to the EU on 1 July 2013, an interim solution, which received permission from the European Commission, was found: every Croatian citizen was allowed to cross the Schengen border into Hungary, Italy or Slovenia with an ID card and a special border card that was issued by Croatian police at border exit control. The police authorities of Hungary, Italy or Slovenia would then stamp the special border card both on entry and exit. Croatian citizens, however, were not allowed to enter any other Schengen Agreement countries without a valid passport, although they were allowed to travel between Hungary, Italy and Slovenia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese arrangements were discontinued on 1 July 2013 when Croatia became an EU member state. Since then, Croatian citizens have been able to enter any EU member state using only an ID card.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 July 2013, Croatian nationals became European Union citizens and acquired the right to move and reside freely in other EU member states, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. On the same day, 14 EU member states (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden) allowed Croatian nationals to work without restrictions in their country. However, 13 other EU member states imposed transitional restrictions on Croatian nationals wishing to access their labour markets.[63] Annex V of the Treaty concerning the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the European Union allows member states to apply national measures regulating Croatian nationals access to their labour markets for a period of up to five years, and in case of serious disturbance to their labour markets or the threat thereof, and after notifying the Commission, for a further two years (i.e. up to a maximum of seven years in total).\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatian nationals who on 1 July 2013 had already resided in an EU member state for a continuous period of at least 5 years acquired the right of permanent residence (meaning that they could work without any restrictions in their host EU member state), as long as during their continuous residence of 5 years they were a worker, self-employed person, self-sufficient person, student or family member accompanying or joining an EU/EEA/Swiss citizen.[64]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 1 July 2013, non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who were family members of a Croatian national and accompanying or joining him/her also acquired the right to move and reside freely in other EU member states.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the run up to accession to the European Union, Croatia aligned its visa policy with that of the European Union. As a result of the new visa regime, some third-country nationals (such as Russian and Turkish nationals) who were previously temporarily exempt from having to obtain a visa to visit Croatia were now subject to a visa requirement. However, to mitigate the effect of the re-imposition of a visa regime on tourist numbers, the Croatian government has introduced a 'facilitated entry of aliens' procedure, exempting travellers who have a Schengen visa or residence permit from having to obtain an additional Croatian visa to visit Croatia until 31 December 2013.[72] In addition, the Croatian government has extended the working hours and capacity of its foreign missions in countries such as Russia and Ukraine to ensure that applications for Croatian visas are processed more efficiently.[73]\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon Croatia's accession to the European Union on 1 July 2013, several countries and territories outside the European Union aligned the visa requirements imposed on Croatian citizens with those imposed on other EU citizens. For example, on 1 July 2013, Hong Kong SAR extended the visa-free period of stay for Croatian citizens from 14 days to 90 days in line with the visa-free period of stay granted to other EU citizens,[74] whilst New Zealand introduced a 90-day visa exemption for Croatian citizens.[75] It is likely that these countries and territories amended their visa policy for Croatian citizens because of the European Union's visa reciprocity mechanism. However, other countries such as Barbados,[76] Brunei,[77]  and the United States[78] have not amended their visa policies to harmonise their treatment of Croatian citizens and other EU citizens.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring June 2011 Croatia began with implementation of the projects and reforms required to join the Schengen Area by 2015.[79] By joining the Schengen Area, border checks will be eliminated at the land border with Hungary and Slovenia, as well as at airports and ports for flights and ships to/from Schengen member states, thus facilitating the freer movement of persons between Croatia and the rest of the Schengen Area.\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatia's accession to the EU obliges them to apply for membership in the European Economic Area (EEA).[80]  The Croatian government submitted their application on 13 September 2012,[81] and membership negotiations started 15 March 2013 with the aim to enlarge both the EU and the EEA on the same date, 1 July 2013.[82]  However, this was not achieved.[83][84]  On 11 April 2014, the EU and its member states (including Croatia), Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein signed an agreement concerning the accession of Croatia to the EEA. It is yet to be ratified, but is provisionally applied with regards to Croatia. As of June 2017, the agreement has been ratified by 17 out of 32 parties.\\r\\n[85]\\r\\n\\r\\nCroatian public opinion was divided on EU accession. Opinion polling for the EU referendum showed the population was mostly in favour of joining. Public support ranged from a high of 80% to lows of 26ÿ38%.[86] Political analyst Vi?eslav Raos cited the economic problems within the EU among the factors: \\"[Croatians] know that the European Union is not a remedy to all economic and social problems. So the EU itself is in a sort of crisis, and that reflects on Croatia's accession.\\"[86] The government announced an information campaign to reverse the drop in support.[86]\\r\\n\\r\\nA referendum was held in Croatia on 22 January 2012 on joining the European Union, and the result was 66% approval to join, though the turnout was low at 43.51%.[3][4][5][6][87]","input":"When did croatia become part of the eu?"},{"output":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt","context":"The United States maintained its Constitutional Republic government structure throughout World War II.

Pilot errors, including poor in-flight decisions and inadequate pre-flight planning, were officially reported as leading to the crash.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout three months prior to the crash, Wichita State contracted Golden Eagle Aviation to supply a Douglas DC-6B, to fly the team to away games for the 1970 season.[6] The four-engined DC-6 was a large, powerful aircraft that could accommodate the entire team. Golden Eagle Aviation did not own the DC-6, but had an arrangement with the Jack Richards Aircraft Company to use it.[6] After the agreements were made, the DC-6 was damaged and was unavailable for use.[6] A pair of Martin 4-0-4s (which had not flown since 1967) were re-certified for flight. On October 2, 1970, these were ferried from the Jack Richards Aircraft Company facilities in Oklahoma City to Wichita, instead of the DC-6.[7]\\r\\nUpon arrival in Wichita, the two aircraft were loaded with luggage and the passengers were boarded. They took off and headed west to a refueling stopover in Denver at Stapleton Airport; from there they would continue to Logan Airport in northern Utah.[8]\\r\\nThe two aircraft were dubbed \\"Gold\\" and \\"Black\\" after the school colors.[6] \\"Gold\\", the aircraft that later crashed, carried the starting players, head coach, and athletic director, as well as their wives, other administrators, boosters, and family. The designated \\"Black\\" plane transported the reserve players, assistant coaches, and other support personnel.[9]\\r\\nThe President of Golden Eagle Aviation, Ronald G. Skipper (1936ÿ2003),[10] was the pilot flying \\"Gold.\\"[4] Although occupying the left seat, he was acting in the capacity of a First Officer because he did not have a type rating on the Martin 4-0-4.[7] During the flight to Denver he visited with passengers in the cabin, advising them that after refueling they would take a scenic route, near Loveland Ski Area and Mount Sniktau, the proposed alpine skiing venues for the 1976 Winter Olympics, recently awarded to Denver in May. The other crew flying the \\"Black\\" aircraft adhered to the original flight plan and took a more northerly route, heading north from Denver to southern Wyoming then west, using a designated airway. Less scenic, this route allowed more time to gain altitude for the climb over the Rocky Mountains.[4][7]\\r\\nWhile the aircraft were refueled and serviced in Denver, First Officer Skipper purchased aeronautical sectional charts for the contemplated scenic route.[8] The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation report stated the First Officer testified that he intended to use the charts to help point out landmarks and objects of interest to the passengers. The report concluded the crew did not allow enough time for the charts to be studied properly to avoid high terrain before takeoff commenced.[7] After takeoff in clear weather, the two aircraft took divergent paths away from Denver.[7]\\r\\nShortly before the crash, several witnesses described seeing an aircraft flying unusually low towards the Continental Divide. Some witnesses located on higher mountainside locations, such as Loveland Pass at 11,990 feet (3,655?m), reported seeing it flying below them.[7] Crash survivor Rick Stephens was a senior guard and stated in 2013, \\"...as we flew along over I-70, that there were old mines and old vehicles above us. I noticed we were quite a bit below the top of the mountains. I got up to go to the cockpit, which wasn't unusual to do, and I could tell we were in trouble, looking out the window and seeing nothing but green in front of us.\\"[11]\\r\\nThe overloaded aircraft,[12][13] nearing Loveland Pass as it flew up Clear Creek Valley, became trapped in a box canyon and was unable to climb above the mountain ridges surrounding it on three sides, nor complete a reversal turn away from the sharply rising terrain.[4] At 1:14?p.m. MDT, the \\"Gold\\" aircraft struck trees on the east slope of Mount Trelease, 1,600 feet (490?m) below its summit, and crashed. The NTSB report stated a belief that many on board survived the initial impact, based on the testimony of survivors and rescuers.[4][7] The load of fuel on board did not explode immediately, allowing survivors to escape the wreckage, but the passenger cabin was eventually consumed by an explosion before those still alive and trapped inside could escape.\\r\\nOf the total of 40 on board, the death count at the scene was 29, which included 27 passengers, captain, and flight attendant. One of the deceased passengers was an off-duty flight attendant who was assisting. Two of the initial 11 survivors later died of their injuries to bring the total dead to 31,[7] 14 of whom were Wichita State football players.[11] First to arrive at the crash scene were construction workers from the nearby Eisenhower Tunnel project and motorists on U.S. 6 (I-70).[14] The first officer (company president) survived; he was flying the plane from the left seat.\\r\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board report states that weather played no role in the accident,[7] and lists the probable cause to be that the pilot made improper decisions in-flight or in planning:\\r\\n\\"The intentional operation of the aircraft over a mountain valley route at an altitude from which the aircraft could neither climb over the obstructing terrain ahead, nor execute a successful course reversal. Significant factors were the overloaded condition of the aircraft, the virtual absence of flight planning for the chosen route of flight from Denver to Logan, a lack of understanding on the part of the crew of the performance capabilities and limitations of the aircraft, and the lack of operational management to monitor and appropriately control the actions of the flightcrew.\\"[7][8]\\r\\nThe USU president, vice president, provost, athletic director, and athletic information officer were all unavailable in the immediate aftermath of the crash, leaving the game to be canceled by John S. Flannery, a USU Information Services employee. Utah State's football team held a memorial service at the stadium where the game was to have been played and placed a wreath on the 50-yard line.[5] Wichita State University officials and family members of the survivors were flown to Denver on an aircraft made available by Robert Docking, the Governor of Kansas.[5] Classes were canceled for Monday, October 5, and a memorial service was held that evening at the university stadium.[5] The remaining members of the Wichita State team, with the NCAA and Missouri Valley Conference allowing freshman players to fill out the squad, decided to continue the 1970 season; it was later designated the \\"Second Season.\\"[5]\\r\\nWichita State and Utah State had played in five of the previous six seasons, but never met again in football.[15] Wichita State discontinued varsity football after the 1986 season.[16]\\r\\nThe accident was the first of two college football charter aircraft to crash in 1970; six weeks later, Southern Airways Flight 932, carrying the Marshall University team, crashed in Huntington, West Virginia as the team returned from a game in North Carolina.\\r\\nWichita State University built a memorial for those who died from the crash called Memorial '70.

The Narragansett language died out for many years but was partially preserved in Roger Williams's A Key into the Languages of America (1643).[2]\\r\\nIn 1636, Roger Williams settled on land granted to him by the Narragansett tribe at the tip of Narragansett Bay after being banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views. He called the site \\"Providence Plantations\\" and declared it a place of religious freedom.\\r\\nIn 1638, Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, John Clarke, Philip Sherman, and other religious dissidents settled on Rhode Island after conferring with Williams,[3] forming the settlement of Portsmouth which was governed by the Portsmouth Compact. The southern part of the island became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders.\\r\\nDissident Samuel Gorton purchased Indian lands at Shawomet in 1642, precipitating a dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, governed by an elected council and president. Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648, which he named Warwick after his patron.[4] The union of these four towns was strengthened by the Royal Charter of 1663. Critics at the time sometimes referred to the Colony as \\"Rogue's Island\\",[5] and Cotton Mather called it \\"the sewer of New England\\" because of the Colony's willingness to accept people who had been banished from Massachusetts Bay.[6]\\r\\nIn 1686, King James II ordered Rhode Island to submit to the Dominion of New England and its appointed governor Edmund Andros. This suspended the Colony's charter, but Rhode Island still managed to retain possession of it until Andros was deposed and the Dominion was dissolved.[7] William of Orange became King after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and Rhode Island's independent government resumed under the 1663 charter, which was used as the state constitution until 1842.[8]\\r\\nIn 1693, William III and Mary II issued a patent extending Rhode Island's territory to three miles \\"east and northeast\\" of Narragansett Bay, conflicting with the claims of Plymouth Colony.[9] This resulted in several later transfers of territory between Rhode Island and Massachusetts.\\r\\nThe early relationship between New Englanders and Indians was mostly peaceable. The largest tribes that lived near Rhode Island were the Wampanoags, Pequots, Narragansetts, and Nipmucks. Squanto was a member of the Wampanoag tribe who stayed with the Pilgrims in Plymouth Colony and taught them many valuable skills needed to survive in the area.\\r\\nRoger Williams won the respect of his Colonial neighbors for his skill in keeping the powerful Narragansetts on friendly terms with the Colonists. In 1637, the Narragansetts formed an alliance with Rhode Island during the Pequot War. However, this peace did not last long, as the most traumatic event in 17th century Rhode Island was King Philip's War (1675ÿ76). Metacomet, the chief of the Wampanoag Indians, was known as King Philip by the settlers of Portsmouth who had purchased their land from his father Massasoit. He led attacks around Narragansett Bay, despite Rhode Island's continued neutrality, and later these spread throughout New England. A force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in southern Rhode Island on December 19, 1675.[10] The Narragansetts also invaded and burned down several of the Rhode Island settlements, including Providence, although they allowed the population to leave first. In one of the final actions of the war, troops from Connecticut led by Captain Benjamin Church hunted down and killed King Philip at Mount Hope.\\r\\nRhode Island was the first British colony in America to formally declare its independence, doing so on May 4, 1776, a full two months before the national Declaration of Independence.[11] Previously, Rhode Islanders attacked the British warship HMS Gaspee in 1772 as one of the first overt acts of rebellion in America. British naval forces under Captain James Wallace controlled Narragansett Bay for much of the Revolution, periodically raiding the islands and the mainland. The British raided Prudence Island for livestock and engaged in a skirmish with American forces, losing approximately a dozen soldiers. Newport remained a hotbed for Tory or Loyalist sympathizers who assisted the British forces. The state appointed General William West of Scituate to root out Tories in the winter of 1775ÿ76. British forces eventually occupied Newport from 1777 to 1778, causing the colonial forces to flee to Bristol.\\r\\nThe Battle of Rhode Island was fought during the summer of 1778 and was an unsuccessful attempt to expel the British from Narragansett Bay, although few colonial casualties occurred. The Marquis de Lafayette called the action the \\"best fought\\" of the war. The following year, the British wanted to concentrate their forces in New York and consequently abandoned Newport.\\r\\nIn 1780, the French under Rochambeau landed in Newport and, for the rest of the war, Newport was the base of the French forces in the United States. The French soldiers behaved themselves so well that, in gratitude, the Rhode Island General Assembly repealed an old law banning Catholics from living in Rhode Island. The first Catholic mass in Rhode Island was said in Newport during this time.\\r\\nRhode Island was the last of the original 13 states to ratify the United States Constitution (May 29, 1790), only doing so after being threatened with having its exports taxed as a foreign nation. Rural resistance to the Constitution was strong in Rhode Island, and the anti-federalist Country Party controlled the General Assembly from 1786 to 1790. In 1788, anti-federalist politician and revolutionary general William West led an armed force of 1,000 men to Providence to oppose a July 4 celebration of the state ratifying the Constitution.[12] Civil war was narrowly averted by a compromise limiting the Fourth of July celebration.\\r\\nRhode Island was heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-Revolution era, prior to industrialization. In 1652, Rhode Island passed the first abolition law in the thirteen colonies, banning African slavery,[13] but the law was not enforced by the end of the 17th century. By 1774, the slave population of RI was 6.3%, nearly twice as high as any other New England colony. In the late 18th century, several Rhode Island merchant families began actively engaging in the triangle slave trade, most notably the Browns, for whom Brown University is named. In the years after the Revolution, Rhode Island merchants controlled between 60 and 90 percent of the American trade in African slaves.[14] In the 18th century, Rhode Island's economy depended largely upon the triangle trade, where Rhode Islanders distilled rum from molasses, sent the rum to Africa to trade for slaves, and then traded the slaves in the West Indies for more molasses.\\r\\nStephen Hopkins introduced a bill while serving in the Rhode Island Assembly in 1774 that prohibited the importation of slaves into the colony. This became one of the first anti-slavery laws in the United States. In February 1784, the Rhode Island Legislature passed a compromise measure for gradual emancipation of slaves within Rhode Island. All children of slaves born after March 1 were to be \\"apprentices,\\" the girls to become free at 18, the boys at 21. By 1840, the census reported only five African Americans enslaved in Rhode Island.[14]\\r\\nDespite the antislavery laws of 1774, 1784, and 1787, an international slave trade continued. In 1789, an Abolition Society was organized to secure enforcement of existing laws against the trade. Leading merchants continued to engage in the trade even after it became illegal, especially John Brown and George DeWolf. After 1770, slaving was never more than a minor aspect of Rhode Island's overall maritime trade.[15]\\r\\nRhode Island manufactured numerous textiles throughout the early 19th century using southern cotton cultivated with slave laboras did all other American textile manufacturers of the time.[16] By the mid-19th century, many Rhode Islanders were active in the abolitionist movement, particularly Quakers in Newport and Providence such as Moses Brown.[17]\\r\\nIn 1790, English immigrant Samuel Slater founded the first textile mill in the United States in Pawtucket, Rhode Island (Slater Mill) and became known as the father of the American industrial revolution. During the 19th century, Rhode Island became one of the most industrialized states in the United States with large numbers of textile factories. The state also had significant machine tool, silverware, and costume jewelry industries.[18]\\r\\nThe Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into cities and attracted large numbers of immigrants from Ireland, and a permanently landlessand therefore votelessclass developed. By 1829, 60% of the state's white men were ineligible to vote. All efforts at reform failed in the face of rural control of the political system. In 1842, Thomas Dorr drafted a liberal constitution which he tried to ratify by popular referendum. However, conservative Governor Samuel Ward King opposed the constitution, leading to the Dorr Rebellion. The Rebellion gained little support and failed, and Dorr went to prison. The conservative elements relented, however, and allowed most American-born men to vote, but the conservative rural towns remained in control of the legislature.[19]\\r\\nDuring the American Civil War, Rhode Island furnished 25,236 fighting men to the Union armies, of which 1,685 died. These comprised 12 infantry regiments, three cavalry regiments, and an assortment of artillery and miscellaneous outfits. Rhode Island used its industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials needed to win the war, along with the other northern states. Rhode Island's continued growth and modernization led to the creation of an urban mass transit system and improved health and sanitation programs. In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation throughout the state.[20] Governor William Sprague IV fought at the First Battle of Bull Run while a sitting governor, and Rhode Island general Ambrose Burnside emerged as one of the major heroes of the war.\\r\\nThe fifty or so years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin called \\"Rhode Island's halcyon era.\\"[21] Rhode Island was a center of the Gilded Age and provided a home (or summer home) to the many of the country's most prominent robber barons.[21] This was a time of incredible growth in textile mills and manufacturing, and saw a huge influx of immigrants to fill those jobs.[21] The state saw increased population growth and urbanization, even as the state denied the growing urban masses access to political power.[21] In politics, the state was dominated by Republicans allied with their mouthpiece newspaper, The Providence Journal.[21] The Journal's editor Henry B. Anthony and his later protege Nelson Aldrich, along with war hero Ambrose Burnside, all Republicans, dominated politics during this time. Aldrich, as US Senator, became known as the \\"General Manager of the United States,\\" for his ability to set high tariffs to protect Rhode Island  and American  goods from foreign competition.[21]\\r\\nIn Newport, New York's wealthiest industrialists created a summer haven to socialize and build ostentatious grand mansions.[21] In Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket, thousands of French-Canadian, Italian, Irish, and Portuguese immigrants arrived to fill jobs in the textile and manufacturing mills.[21] In response, the Know Nothing party, allied with the Republicans and the Providence Journal, sought to exclude these newcomers from the political process.[21] The constitution of 1843 denied the vote to the landless poor, and ensured that urban centers were disproportionately underrepresented in the state legislature.[21]\\r\\nAround the start of the 20th century, Rhode Island had a booming economy, which fed the demand for immigration. During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 troops, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza.[22]\\r\\nIn the 1920s and 30s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, largely among the native-born white population, in reaction to the large waves of immigrants moving to the state. The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate, Rhode Island, which was a school for African American children.[23]\\r\\nIn 1935, Governor Theodore Francis Green and Democratic majorities in the state House and Senate replaced a Republican dominance that had existed since the middle of the 19th century in what is termed the \\"Bloodless Revolution.\\" The Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated state politics ever since.[24][25] Since then, the Speaker of the House has always been a Democrat and one of the most powerful figures in government.\\r\\nThe Democratic Party presents itself as a coalition of labor unions, working class immigrants, intellectuals, college students, and the rising ethnic middle class. The Republican Party has been dominant in rural and suburban parts of the state, and has nominated occasional reform candidates who criticize the state's high taxes and excesses of Democratic domination. Cranston Mayors Edward D. DiPrete and Stephen Laffey, Governor Donald Carcieri of East Greenwich, and former Mayor Vincent A. \\"Buddy\\" Cianci of Providence ran as Republican reform candidates.\\r\\nThe state income tax was first enacted in 1971 as a temporary measure. Prior to 1971, there was no income tax in the state, but the temporary income tax soon became permanent. The tax burden in Rhode Island remains among the five highest in the United States, including sales, gasoline, property, cigarette, corporate, and capital gains taxes.[26][27]\\r\\nRhode Islanders have overwhelmingly supported and re-elected Democrats to positions of authority, where issues are promoted involving education, health care, and liberal causes. As of 2014[update] Rhode Island has heavily Democrat-controlled legislatures; both U.S. Senators and Congressmen, and all statewide offices are held by Democrats. The state has been carried by Democrat presidential candidates in every election since 1988.[28]","input":"What was the original purpose of the rhode island colony?"},{"output":"the pudendal cleft","context":"The labia minora, Latin for smaller lips, singular: labium minus \\"smaller lip\\", also known as the inner labia, inner lips, vaginal lips or nymphae,[1] are two flaps of skin on either side of the human vaginal opening in the vulva, situated between the labia majora (the Latin for larger lips; also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color, and shape from individual to individual.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe labia minora extend from the clitoris obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the vulval vestibule, ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. The posterior ends (bottom) of the labia minora are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the frenulum of labia minora or fourchette.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the front, each lip forks dividing into two portions surrounding the clitoris. The upper part of each lip passes above the clitoris to meet the upper part of the other lipwhich will often be a little larger or smallerforming a fold which overhangs the glans clitoridis (clitoral tip or head); this fold is named the clitoral hood. The lower part passes beneath the glans clitoridis and becomes united to its under surface, forming, with the inner lip of the opposite side, the frenulum clitoridis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe clitoral hood, analogously to the foreskin of the penis in men and also termed, like the latter, by the Latin word prepuce, serves to cover most of the time the shaft and sometimes the glans (which is very sensitive to the touch) to protect the clitoris from mechanical irritation and from dryness. Yet the hood is movable and can slide during clitoral erection or be pulled upwards a little for greater exposure of the clitoris to sexual stimulation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe frenulum (Latin for little bridle) is an elastic band of tissue attached by its one end to the clitoral shaft and glans and by its other end to the prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend to let the hood be moved upwards to expose the glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and secondly, it contracts to pull the hood back to protect it.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the opposed surfaces of the labia minora are numerous sebaceous glands not associated with hair follicles. They are lined by stratified squamous epithelium on those surfaces.[2][page?needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLike the whole area of the vulval vestibule, the mucus secreted by those glands protects the labia from dryness and mechanical irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing thinner than the outer labia, the inner labia can be also more narrow than the former, or wider than labia majora, thus protruding in the pudendal cleft and making the term minora (Latin for smaller) essentially inapplicable in these cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reception of wider and/or longer labia varies considerably between different people, with some men and women stressing the beauty of bigger labia while other women who have such ones complain of some discomfort either from mechanical irritation by their tighter clothes or from their own or their peers' negative attitude to the image of less compact female genitalia than is stereotypical for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey can also be smooth or frilled, the latter being more typical of longer or wider inner labia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2003 to 2004, researchers from the Department of Gynaecology, Elizabeth Garret Anderson Hospital in London, measured the labia and other genital structures of 50 women from the age of 18 to 50, with a mean age of 35.6. The results were:[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the frequent portrayal of the pudendal cleft without protrusion in art and pornography, there has been a rise in the popularity of labiaplasty, surgery to alter the labia - usually, to make them smaller.[4][5][6] On the other hand, there is an opposite movement of labia stretching. Its proponents stress the beauty of long labia and their positive role in sexual stimulation of both partners.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabiaplasty is also sometimes sought by women who have asymmetrical labia minora to adjust the shape of the structures towards identical size.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nLabia stretching has traditionally been practiced in some African nations.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe inner lips serve to protect from mechanical irritation, dryness and infections the highly sensitive area of the vulval vestibule with vaginal and urethral openings in it between them. During vaginal sexual intercourse they may contribute to stimulation of the whole vestibule area, the clitoris and the vagina of the woman and the penis of her partner. Stimulation of the clitoris may occur through tension of the clitoral hood and its frenulum by inner labia pulling at them. During sexual arousal they are lubricated by the mucus secreted in the vagina and around it to make penetration painless and protect them from irritation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the female external urethral opening (meatus) is also situated between labia minora, they may play a role in guiding the stream of the urine during female urination.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing very sensitive by their structure to any irritation, and situated in the excretion area where traces of urine, vaginal discharge, smegma and even feces may be present, the inner lips may be susceptible to inflammatory infections of the vulva such as vulvitis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe likelihood of inflammation may be reduced through appropriate regular hygienic cleansing of the whole vulval vestibule, using water and medically tested cleansing agents designed for female intimate areas. To avoid contamination of the vulva with fecal bacteria, it is recommended that the vulva is washed only from front to back, from mons pubis to the perineum and anus. Apart from water and special liquid cleansing agents (lotions), there are commercially available wet wipes for female intimate hygiene. Some women wipe the vulval vestibule dry with toilet tissue after urination to avoid irritation and infections from residual drops of the urine in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, incorrect choice of cleansing agents, or their incorrect application, may itself cause labial irritation and require medical attention. Over-vigorous rubbing of the labia of little girls while washing, combined with the lack of estrogen in their bodies, may lead to the mostly pediatric condition known as labial fusion. If fused labia prevent urination, urine may accumulate and cause pain and inflammation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn adult females, irritation of the area may be caused by wearing too-tight underwear (especially where wider inner labia protrude in the pudendal cleft); while G-strings, which rub against the labia during body movements, may cause irritation or lead to infection from bacteria transferred from either the external environment or the anus.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrgans of the female reproductive system.\\r\\n\\r\\nOuter anatomy of clitoris.\\r\\n\\r\\nLabia minora.

Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds[1] of domestic rabbit. Sylvilagus includes thirteen wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail. The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet. With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit (or bunny) is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily lifeas food, clothing, and companion, and as a source of artistic inspiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nMale rabbits are called bucks; females are called does.  An older term for an adult rabbit is coney, while rabbit once referred only to the young animals.[2] Another term for a young rabbit is bunny, though this term is often applied informally (especially by children) to rabbits generally, especially domestic ones. More recently, the term kit or kitten has been used to refer to a young rabbit. A young hare is called a leveret; this term is sometimes informally applied to a young rabbit as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nA group of rabbits is known as a colony or nest (or, occasionally, a warren, though this more commonly refers to where the rabbits live).[3] A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a litter,[4] and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a herd.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\nRabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Below are some of the genera and species of the rabbit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOrder Lagomorpha\\r\\n\\r\\n????Family Leporidae\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHares are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision, while rabbits are altricial, born hairless and blind, and requiring closer care. Hares (and cottontail rabbits) live a relatively solitary life in a simple nest above the ground, while most rabbits live in social groups underground in burrows or warrens. Hares are generally larger than rabbits, with ears that are more elongated, and with hind legs that are larger and longer. Hares have not been domesticated, while descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets.\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits have long been domesticated.  Beginning in the Middle Ages, the European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient Rome. Selective breeding has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, many of which (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets. Some strains of rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs livestock, rabbits are bred for their meat and fur.  The earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so became larger than wild rabbits, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant. Rabbit fur, prized for its softness, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, as well as lengths. The Angora rabbit breed, for example, was developed for its long, silky fur, which is often hand-spun into yarn. Other domestic rabbit breeds have been developed primarily for the commercial fur trade, including the Rex, which has a short plush coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause the rabbit's epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. Rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other. This way they can be distinguished from rodents, with which they are often confused.[6] Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. However, recent DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor has supported the view that they do share a common lineage, and thus rabbits and rodents are now often referred to together as members of the superorder Glires.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince speed and agility are a rabbit's main defenses against predators (including the swift fox), rabbits have large hind leg bones and well developed musculature. Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade form. Rabbits use their strong nails for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense.[citation needed] Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. Each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).[8]\\r\\nMost wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies. The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage. The tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below. Cottontails have white on the top of their tails.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the position of the eyes in its skull, the rabbit has a field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees, with just a small blind spot at the bridge of the nose.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe anatomy of rabbits hind limbs are structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contribute to their specialized form of locomotion. The Bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral ossification during development.[11] Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the ox coxae. The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia. The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot. The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs. This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion. Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds. Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster.[12] Rabbits stay just on their toes when moving this is called Digitigrade locomotion. The hind feet have four long toes that allow for this and are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping.[13] Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion. Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts; foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature, that are much longer than the forelimbs providing more force. Rabbits run on their toes to gain the optimal stride during locomotion. The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed to both the structural anatomy of the fusion tibia and fibula, and muscular features.[15] Bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles. Action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures. Rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction.[16] In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue. For example, hares have a greater resistant to fatigue than cottontails. The muscles of rabbit's hind limbs can be classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors. The quadricep muscles are in charge of force production when jumping. Complimenting these muscles are the hamstrings which aid in short bursts of action. These muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and doriflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the order lagomorphs, the ears are utilized to detect and avoid predators. In the family leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide. For example, in black tailed jack rabbits, their long ears cover a greater surface area relative to their body size that allow them to detect predators from far away. Contrasted to cotton tailed rabbits, their ears are smaller and shorter, requiring predators to be closer to detect them before fleeing. Evolution has favored rabbits to have shorter ears so the larger surface area does not cause them to lose heat in more temperate regions. The opposite can be seen in rabbits that live in hotter climates, mainly because they possess longer ears that have a larger surface area that help with dispersion of heat as well as the theory that sound does not travel well in more arid air, opposed to cooler air. Therefore, longer ears are meant to aid the organism in detecting prey sooner rather than later in warmer temperatures.[18] The rabbit is characterized by its shorter ears while hares are characterized by their longer ears.[19] Rabbits ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation and detect predators due to how the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.[20]\\r\\nOuter ear\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Auricle (anatomy), also known as the pinna is a rabbit's outer ear.[21] The rabbit's body surface is mainly taken up by the pinnae. It is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above 30C with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this. Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbit's vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares.[22] The rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nMiddle ear\\r\\n\\r\\nThe middle ear is filled with three bones called ossicles and is separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit's skull.The three ossicles are called hammer, anvil, and stirrup and act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear. In general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy. [23]\\r\\n\\r\\nInner ear\\r\\nInner ear fluid called endolymph receives the sound energy. After receiving the energy, later within the inner ear there are two parts: the cochlea that  utilizes sound waves from the ossicles and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit's position in regards to movement. Within the cochlea there is a basilar membrane that contains sensory hair structures utilized to send nerve signals to the brain so it can recognize different sound frequencies. Within the vestibular apparatus the rabbit possesses three semicircular canals to help detect angular motion.[23]\\r\\nThermoregulation is the process that an organism utilizes to maintain an optimal body temperature even if there are severe external conditions.[24] This process is carried out by the pinnae which takes up most of the rabbit's body surface and contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts.[25] In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around 21.[26] If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must return to homeostasis. Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by the use of their large, highly vascularized ears that are able to change the amount of blood flow that passes through the ears.   \\r\\n\\r\\nConstriction and dilation of blood vessels in the ears are used to control the core body temperature of a rabbit. If the core temperature exceeds its optimal temperature greatly, blood flow is constricted to limit the amount of blood going through the vessels. With this constriction, there is only a limited amount of blood that is passing through the ears where ambient heat would be able to heat the blood that is flowing through the ears and therefore, increasing the body temperature. Constriction is also used when the ambient temperature is much lower than that of the rabbit's core body temperature. When the ears are constricted it again limits blood flow through the ears to conserve the optimal body temperature of the rabbit. If the ambient temperature is either 15 degrees above or below the optimal body temperature, the blood vessels will dilate. With the blood vessels being enlarged, the blood is able to pass through the large surface area which causes it to either heat or cool down.   \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the summer, the rabbit has the capability to stretch its pinnae which allows for greater surface area and increase heat dissipation. In the winter, the rabbit does the opposite and folds its ears in order to decrease its surface area to the ambient air which would decrease their body temperature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe jackrabbit has the largest ears within the Oryctolagus cuniculus group. Their ears contribute to 17% of their total body surface area.  Their large pinna were evolved to maintain homeostasis while in the extreme temperatures of the desert.\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits are herbivores that feed by grazing on grass, forbs, and leafy weeds. In consequence, their diet contains large amounts of cellulose, which is hard to digest. Rabbits solve this problem via a form of hindgut fermentation. They pass two distinct types of feces: hard droppings and soft black viscous pellets, the latter of which are known as caecotrophs and are immediately eaten (a behaviour known as coprophagy). Rabbits reingest their own droppings (rather than chewing the cud as do cows and numerous other herbivores) to digest their food further and extract sufficient nutrients.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding.[citation needed] In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested.[citation needed] If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals.[citation needed] While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nHard pellets are made up of hay-like fragments of plant cuticle and stalk, being the final waste product after redigestion of soft pellets. These are only released outside the burrow and are not reingested. Soft pellets are usually produced several hours after grazing, after the hard pellets have all been excreted.[citation needed] They are made up of micro-organisms and undigested plant cell walls.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits are hindgut digesters. This means that most of their digestion takes place in their large intestine and cecum. In rabbits, the cecum is about 10 times bigger than the stomach and it along with the large intestine makes up roughly 40% of the rabbit's digestive tract.[28] The unique musculature of the cecum allows the intestinal tract of the rabbit to separate fibrous material from more digestible material; the fibrous material is passed as feces, while the more nutritious material is encased in a mucous lining as a cecotrope. Cecotropes, sometimes called \\"night feces\\", are high in minerals, vitamins and proteins that are necessary to the rabbit's health. Rabbits eat these to meet their nutritional requirements; the mucous coating allows the nutrients to pass through the acidic stomach for digestion in the intestines. This process allows rabbits to extract the necessary nutrients from their food.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chewed plant material collects in the large cecum, a secondary chamber between the large and small intestine containing large quantities of symbiotic bacteria that help with the digestion of cellulose and also produce certain B vitamins. The pellets are about 56% bacteria by dry weight, largely accounting for the pellets being 24.4% protein on average. The soft feces form here and contain up to five times the vitamins of hard feces. After being excreted, they are eaten whole by the rabbit and redigested in a special part of the stomach. The pellets remain intact for up to six hours in the stomach; the bacteria within continue to digest the plant carbohydrates. This double-digestion process enables rabbits to use nutrients that they may have missed during the first passage through the gut, as well as the nutrients formed by the microbial activity and thus ensures that maximum nutrition is derived from the food they eat.[9] This process serves the same purpose in the rabbit as rumination does in cattle and sheep.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits are incapable of vomiting.[31] Because rabbits can't vomit, if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fiber[32]), intestinal blockage can occur.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but their natural inclination is toward nocturnal activity.[34] In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day.[35] As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Escherichia coli, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses RHD (\\"rabbit hemorrhagic hisease\\", a form of calicivirus)[37] or myxomatosis. Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as Taenia serialis), external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, and Toxoplasma gondii.[38][39] Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis.[40] Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.[41]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits are prey animals and are therefore constantly aware of their surroundings. For instance, in Mediterranean Europe, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes.[42] If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning.[43] They survive predation by burrowing, hopping away in a zig-zag motion, and, if captured, delivering powerful kicks with their hind legs. Their strong teeth allow them to eat and to bite in order to escape a struggle.[44] The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18.[45] The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is less than one year.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbit habitats include meadows, woods, forests, grasslands, deserts and wetlands.[47] Rabbits live in groups, and the best known species, the European rabbit, lives in underground burrows, or rabbit holes. A group of burrows is called a warren.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than half the world's rabbit population resides in North America.[47] They are also native to southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and in parts of Africa and South America. They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present. Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great American Interchange. Much of the continent has just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, while most of South America's southern cone is without rabbits.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European rabbit has been introduced to many places around the world.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture. Gassing, barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis (myxo or mixi, colloquially) and calicivirus. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virus. The virus was developed in Spain, and is beneficial to rabbit farmers. If it were to make its way into wild populations in areas such as Australia, it could create a population boom, as those diseases are the most serious threats to rabbit survival. Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that land owners are legally obliged to control them.[48][49]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some areas, wild rabbits and hares are hunted for their meat, a lean source of high quality protein.[50] In the wild, such hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs, as well as with snares or other traps, and rifles. A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term rabbit punch is derived.\\r\\n\\r\\nWild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption. Domesticated descendants of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200 million tons of rabbit meat produced annually.[51] In 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with 8.89 kilograms (19.6?lb), Italy with 5.71 kilograms (12.6?lb), and Cyprus with 4.37 kilograms (9.6?lb), falling to 0.03 kilograms (0.066?lb) in Japan. The figure for the United States was 0.14 kilograms (0.31?lb) per capita. The largest producers of rabbit meat in 1994 were China, Russia, Italy, France, and Spain.[52] Rabbit meat was once a common commodity in Sydney, Australia, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United Kingdom, fresh rabbit is sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat. At farmers markets there, including the famous Borough Market in London, rabbit carcasses are sometimes displayed hanging, unbutchered (in the traditional style), next to braces of pheasant or other small game. Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with \\"raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving\\".[53] In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to spicy duck neck.[51] Rabbit meat is comparatively unpopular elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn extremely rare infection associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as rabbit fever), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit.[54] Hunters are at higher risk for tularemia because of the potential for inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process. An even more rare condition is protein poisoning, which was first noted as a consequence of eating rabbit meat to exclusion (hence the colloquial term, \\"rabbit starvation\\"). Protein poisoning, which is associated with extreme conditions of the total absence of dietary fat and protein, was noted by Vilhjalmur Stefansson in the late 19th century and in the journals of Charles Darwin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to their meat, rabbits are used for their wool, fur, and pelts, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk.[55] Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the well-known Angora rabbit) to efficiently fill these needs.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nRabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny. The species' role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence, and in folklore and modern children's stories, rabbits often appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth of all kinds (for example, the Velveteen Rabbit, or Thumper in Bambi).\\r\\n\\r\\n With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny. The rabbit (as a swift prey animal) is also known for its speed, agility, and endurance, symbolized (for example) by the marketing icon the \\"Energizer Bunny\\" (known in Europe and Australia as the \\"Duracell Bunny\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br'er Rabbit (from African-American folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for example.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (the White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in Watership Down (including the film and television adaptations), in Rabbit Hill (by Robert Lawson), and in the Peter Rabbit stories (by Beatrix Potter).  In the 1920s, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, was a popular cartoon character.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rabbit's foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck. This belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in Europe c. 600?BC.[58]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the Isle of Portland in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky and even speaking the creature's name can cause upset among older island residents. This is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry where (to save space) extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set side in what became tall, unstable walls. The local rabbits' tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls and their collapse resulted in injuries or even death. Thus, invoking the name of the culprit became an unlucky act to be avoided. In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a long ears or underground mutton, so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself. While it was true 50 years ago that a pub on the island could be emptied by calling out the word \\"rabbit\\", this has become more fable than fact in modern times.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other parts of Britain and in North America, invoking the rabbit's name may instead bring good luck. \\"Rabbit rabbit rabbit\\" is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word \\"rabbit\\" (or \\"rabbits\\" or \\"white rabbits\\" or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so will ensure good fortune for the duration of that month.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"rabbit test\\" is a term, first used in 1949, for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans. It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant. This led to the phrase \\"the rabbit died\\" becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test.","input":"What are a group of baby rabbits called?"},{"output":"Georgy Malenkov","context":"Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was the head of government[1] and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was the head of state.[2] The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World[1] whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World.[2] In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin, the head of the Soviet state was a collegiate body of the vanguard party (see What Is To Be Done?).\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing Joseph Stalin's consolidation of power in the 1920s,[3] the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with leader of the Soviet Union[4] because the post controlled both the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.[3] The post of the General Secretary was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary. In 1966, Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU),[5] the office of the General Secretary was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990.[6][incomplete short citation] The post of General Secretary lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the General Secretary as the highest Soviet political office.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\nContemporaneously to establishment of the office of the President, representatives of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to remove Article 6 from the Soviet Constitution which stated that the Soviet Union was a one-party state controlled by the Communist Party which in turn played the leading role in society. This vote weakened the party and its hegemony over the Soviet Union and its people.[8] Upon death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent President, the Vice President of the Soviet Union would assume the office, though the Soviet Union collapsed before this was actually tested.[9] After the failed August coup, the Vice President was replaced by an elected member of the State Council of the Soviet Union.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nVladimir Lenin was voted the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union (Sovnarkom) on 30 December 1922 by the Congress of Soviets.[11] At the age of 53, his health declined from effects of two bullet wounds, later aggravated by three strokes which culminated with his death in 1924.[12] Irrespective of his health status in his final days, Lenin was already losing much of his power to Joseph Stalin.[13] Alexei Rykov succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the Sovnarkom and although he was de jure the most powerful person in the country, the Politburo of the Communist Party began to overshadow the Sovnarkom in the mid-1920s. By the end of the decade, Rykov merely rubber stamped the decisions predetermined by Stalin and the Politburo.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nStalin's early policies pushed for rapid industrialisation, nationalisation of private industry[15] and the collectivisation of private plots created under Lenin's New Economic Policy.[16] As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political murder, repression and persecution.[17] Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941,[18] but by December the Soviet Army managed to stop the attack just shy of Moscow. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet Union launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany which finally succeeded in 1945.[19] Stalin died in March 1953[20] and his death triggered a power struggle in which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nKhrushchev denounced Stalin on two occasions, first in 1956 and then in 1962. His policy of de-Stalinisation earned him many enemies within the party, especially from old Stalinist appointees. Many saw this approach as destructive and destabilising. A group known as Anti-Party Group tried to oust Khrushchev from office in 1957, but it failed.[22] As Khrushchev grew older, his erratic behavior became worse, usually making decisions without discussing or confirming them with the Politburo.[23] Leonid Brezhnev, a close companion of Khrushchev, was elected First Secretary the same day of Khrushchev's removal from power. Alexei Kosygin became the new Premier and Anastas Mikoyan kept his office as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. On the orders of the Politburo, Mikoyan was forced to retire in 1965 and Nikolai Podgorny took over the office of Chairman of the Presidium.[24] The Soviet Union in the post-Khrushchev 1960s was governed by a collective leadership.[25] Henry A. Kissinger, the American National Security Advisor, mistakenly believed that Kosygin was the leader of the Soviet Union and that he was at the helm of Soviet foreign policy because he represented the Soviet Union at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference.[26] The \\"Era of Stagnation\\", a derogatory term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev, was a period marked by low socio-economic efficiency in the country and a gerontocracy ruling the country.[27] Yuri Andropov (aged 68 at the time) succeeded Brezhnev in his post as General Secretary in 1982. In 1983, Andropov was hospitalised and rarely met up at work to chair the politburo meetings due to his declining health. Nikolai Tikhonov usually chaired the meetings in his place.[28] Following Andropov's death fifteen months after his appointment, an even older leader, 72 year old Konstantin Chernenko, was elected to the General Secretariat. His rule lasted for little more than a year until his death thirteen months later on 10 March 1985.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the age of 54, Mikhail Gorbachev was elected to the General Secretariat by the Politburo on 11 March 1985.[30] In May 1985, Gorbachev publicly admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequate living standards, being the first Soviet leader to do so while also beginning a series of fundamental reforms. From 1986 to around 1988, he dismantled central planning, allowed state enterprises to set their own outputs, enabled private investment in businesses not previously permitted to be privately owned and allowed foreign investment, among other measures. He also opened up the management of and decision-making within the Soviet Union and allowed greater public discussion and criticism, along with a warming of relationships with the West. These twin policies were known as perestroika (literally meaning \\"reconstruction\\", but it varies) and glasnost (\\"openness\\" and \\"transparency\\"), respectively.[31] The dismantling of the principal defining features of Soviet Communism in 1988 and 1989 in the Soviet Union led to the unintended consequence of the Soviet Union breaking up after the failed August coup of 1991 led by Gennady Yanayev.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following list includes only those persons who held the top leadership position of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) from its founding in 1922 until the party's demise as the official \\"leading power\\" of the Union in 1991 and in the few months aftwerward, lead the government. ? denotes leaders who died in office.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn four occasionsthe 2ÿ3 year period between Vladimir Lenin's incapacitation and Joseph Stalin's dictatorship; the three months immediately following Stalin's death; the interval between Nikita Khrushchev's fall and Leonid Brezhnev's consolidation of power; and the ailing Konstantin Chernenko's tenure as General Secretarya form of collective leadership known as the troika (\\"triumvirate\\")[60] governed the Soviet Union, with no single individual holding leadership alone.[24][40][61]","input":"Who was the 3rd leader of the soviet union?"},{"output":"within certain atmospheric phenomena (such as tornadoes)","context":"Wind speed, or wind flow velocity, is a fundamental atmospheric quantity.\\r\\nWind speed is caused by air moving from high pressure to low pressure, usually due to changes in temperature. Note that wind direction is usually almost parallel to isobars (and not perpendicular as one might expect), due to the rotation of the earth.\\r\\nWind speed affects weather forecasting, aircraft and maritime operations, construction projects, growth and metabolism rate of many plant species, and countless other implications.[1]\\r\\nWind speed is now commonly measured with an anemometer but can also be classified using the older Beaufort scale which is based on people's observation of specifically defined wind effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWind speed is affected by a number of factors and situations, operating on varying scales (from micro to macro scales). These include the pressure gradient, Rossby waves and jet streams, and local weather conditions. There are also links to be found between wind speed and wind direction, notably with the pressure gradient and terrain conditions.\\r\\nPressure gradient is a term to describe the difference in air pressure between two points in the atmosphere or on the surface of the Earth. It is vital to wind speed, because the greater the difference in pressure, the faster the wind flows (from the high to low pressure) to balance out the variation. The pressure gradient, when combined with the Coriolis effect and friction, also influences wind direction.\\r\\nRossby waves are strong winds in the upper troposphere. These operate on a global scale and move from West to East (hence being known as Westerlies). The Rossby waves are themselves a different wind speed from what we experience in the lower troposphere.\\r\\nLocal weather conditions play a key role in influencing wind speed, as the formation of hurricanes, monsoons and cyclones as freak weather conditions can drastically affect the flow velocity of the wind.\\r\\nThe fastest wind speed not related to tornadoes ever recorded was during the passage of Tropical Cyclone Olivia on 10 April 1996: an automatic weather station on Barrow Island, Australia, registered a maximum wind gust of 408?km/h (220?kn; 253?mph; 113?m/s).[2] The wind gust was evaluated by the WMO Evaluation Panel who found that the anemometer was mechanically sound and the gust was within statistical probability and ratified the measurement in 2010. The anemometer was mounted 10 m above ground level (and thus 64 m above sea level). During the cyclone, several extreme gusts of greater than 300?km/h (160?kn; 83?m/s) were recorded, with a maximum 5-minute mean speed of 176?km/h (95?kn; 110?mph; 49?m/s), the extreme gust factor was in the order of 2.27ÿ2.75 times the mean wind speed. The pattern and scales of the gusts suggest that a mesovortex was embedded in the already strong eyewall of the cyclone.[3]\\r\\nThe now second highest surface wind speed ever officially recorded is 372?km/h (231?mph; 103?m/s) at the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Observatory: 6,288?ft (1917?m) above sea level in the US on 12 April 1934, using a heated anemometer. The anemometer, specifically designed for use on Mount Washington was later tested by the US National Weather Bureau and confirmed to be accurate.[4]\\r\\nWind speeds within certain atmospheric phenomena (such as tornadoes) may greatly exceed these values but have never been accurately measured. Directly measuring these tornadic winds is rarely done as the violent wind would destroy the instruments. A method of estimating speed is to use Doppler on Wheels to sense the wind speeds remotely,[5] and, using this method, the figure of 486?km/h (302?mph; 135?m/s) during the 1999 Bridge CreekÿMoore tornado in Oklahoma on 3 May 1999 is often quoted as the highest-recorded surface wind speed,[6] although another figure of 512 kilometres per hour (318?mph) has also been quoted for the same tornado.[7] Yet another number used by the Center for Severe Weather Research for that measurement is 486?I?32?km/h (302?I?20?mph).[8] However, speeds measured by Doppler radar are not considered official records.[7]\\r\\nAn anemometer is one of the tools used to measure wind speed[9]. A device consisting of a vertical pillar and 4 concave cups, the anemometer captures the horizontal movement of air particles (wind speed).\\r\\nAnother tool used to measure wind velocity includes a GPS combined with pilot tube. A fluid flow velocity tool, the pilot tube is primarily used to determine the air velocity of an aircraft.\\r\\nWind speed is a common factor in the design of structures and buildings around the world. It is often the governing factor in the required lateral strength of a structure's design.\\r\\nIn the United States, the wind speed used in design is often referred to as a \\"3-second gust\\" which is the highest sustained gust over a 3-second period having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50 (ASCE 7-05)[10]. This design wind speed is accepted by most building codes in the United States and often governs the lateral design of buildings and structures.\\r\\nIn Canada, reference wind pressures are used in design and are based on the \\"mean hourly\\" wind speed having a probability of being exceeded per year of 1 in 50. The reference wind pressure (q) is calculated in Pascals using the following equation (ref: NBC 2005 Structural Commentaries - Part 4 of Div. B, Comm. I): q=(1/2)pV2 where p is the air density in kg/m3 and V is wind speed in m/s.\\r\\nHistorically, wind speeds have been reported with a variety of averaging times (such as fastest mile, 3-second gust, 1-minute and mean hourly) which designers may have to take into account. To convert wind speeds from one averaging time to another, the Durst Curve (Ref: ASCE 7-05 commentary Figure C6-4, ASCE 7-10 C26.5-1) was developed which defines the relation between probable maximum wind speed averaged over t seconds, Vt, and mean wind speed over one hour V3600.","input":"When do the highest surface wind speeds occur?"},{"output":"2 hours, 52 minutes, 59 seconds","context":"","input":"How fast could the concorde go from new york to london?"},{"output":"Virginia","context":"Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is designed to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor vehicle owner typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor vehicle owner pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors.\\r\\nInsurance companies provide a motor vehicle owner with an insurance card for the particular coverage term which is to be kept in the vehicle in the event of a traffic collision as proof of insurance. Recently, states have started passing laws that electronic versions of proof of insurance can now be accepted by the authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nConsumers may be protected by different levels of coverage depending on which insurance policy they purchase. Coverage is sometimes seen as 20/40/15 or 100/300/100. The first two numbers seen are for medical coverage. In the 100/300 example, the policy will pay $100,000 per person up to $300,000 total for all people. The last number covers property damage. This property damage can cover the other person's vehicle or anything that you hit and damage as a result of the accident. In some states you must purchase Personal Injury Protection which covers medical bills, time lost at work, and many other things. You can also purchase insurance if the other driver does not have insurance or is under insured. Most if not all states require drivers to carry mandatory liability insurance coverage to ensure that their drivers can cover the cost of damage to other people or property in the event of an accident. Some states, such as Wisconsin, have more flexible \\"proof of financial responsibility\\" requirements.[1]\\r\\nIn the United States in 2015, the largest vehicle insurance providers, in terms of market share, were State Farm Insurance, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Allstate, Berkshire Hathaway (which operates as Geico), and The Travelers Companies.[2] Insurance is secured either by working with an independent insurance agent or with an insurance broker who is authorized to sell insurance policies. Some can represent from several agencies, like Guy Carpenter & Company or a growing number of online brokers who provide policy purchases through sites like Quote.com and Walmart.[3]\\r\\nLiability coverage, sometimes known as Casualty insurance, is offered for bodily injury (BI) or property damage (PD) for which the insured driver is deemed responsible. The amount of coverage provided (a fixed dollar amount) will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Whatever the minimum, the insured can usually increase the coverage (prior to a loss) for an additional charge.\\r\\nAn example of property damage is where an insured driver (or 1st party) drives into a telephone pole and damages the pole; liability coverage pays for the damage to the pole. In this example, the drivers insured may also become liable for other expenses related to damaging the telephone pole, such as loss of service claims (by the telephone company), depending on the jurisdiction. An example of bodily injury is where an insured driver causes bodily harm to a third party and the insured driver is deemed responsible for the injuries. However, in some jurisdictions, the third party would first exhaust coverage for accident benefits through their own insurer (assuming they have one) and/or would have to meet a legal definition of severe impairment to have the right to claim (or sue) under the insured driver's (or first party's) policy. If the third party sues the insured driver, liability coverage also covers court costs and damages that the insured driver may be deemed responsible for.\\r\\nIn some states, such as New Jersey, it is illegal to operate (or knowingly allow another to operate) a motor vehicle that does not have liability insurance coverage. If an accident occurs in a state that requires liability coverage, both parties are usually required to bring and/or submit copies of insurance cards to court as proof of liability coverage.\\r\\nIn some jurisdictions: Liability coverage is available either as a combined single limit policy, or as a split limit policy:\\r\\nA combined single limit combines property damage liability coverage and bodily injury coverage under one single combined limit. For example, an insured driver with a combined single liability limit strikes another vehicle and injures the driver and the passenger. Payments for the damages to the other driver's car, as well as payments for injury claims for the driver and passenger, would be paid out under this same coverage.\\r\\nA split limit liability coverage policy splits the coverages into property damage coverage and bodily injury coverage. In the example given above, payments for the other driver's vehicle would be paid out under property damage coverage, and payments for the injuries would be paid out under bodily injury coverage.\\r\\nBodily injury liability coverage is also usually split into a maximum payment per person and a maximum payment per accident.\\r\\nThe limits are often expressed separated by slashes in the following form: \\"bodily injury per person\\"/\\"bodily injury per accident\\"/\\"property damage\\". For example, California requires this minimum coverage:[4]\\r\\nThis would be expressed as \\"$15,000/$30,000/$5,000\\".\\r\\nAnother example, in the state of Oklahoma, drivers must carry at least state minimum liability limits of $25,000/$50,000/$25,000.[5] If an insured driver hits a car full of people and is found by the insurance company to be liable, the insurance company will pay $25,000 of one person's medical bills but will not exceed $50,000 for other people injured in the accident. The insurance company will not pay more than $25,000 for property damage in repairs to the vehicle that the insured one hit.\\r\\nIn the state of Indiana, the minimum liability limits are $25,000/$50,000/$10,000,[6] so there is a greater property damage exposure for only carrying the minimum limits.\\r\\nGenerally, liability coverage purchased through a private insurer extends to rental cars. Comprehensive policies (\\"full coverage\\") usually also apply to the rental vehicle, although this should be verified beforehand. Full coverage premiums are based on, among other factors, the value of the insured's vehicle. This coverage, however, cannot apply to rental cars because the insurance company does not want to assume responsibility for a claim greater than the value of the insured's vehicle, assuming that a rental car may be worth more than the insured's vehicle.\\r\\nMost rental car companies offer insurance to cover damage to the rental vehicle. These policies may be unnecessary for many customers as credit card companies, such as Visa and MasterCard, now provide supplemental collision damage coverage to rental cars if the rental transaction is processed using one of their cards. These benefits are restrictive in terms of the types of vehicles covered.[7]\\r\\nMaine requires car insurance to rent a car.\\r\\nFull coverage is the term commonly used to refer to the combination of comprehensive and collision coverages (liability is generally also implied.) The term full coverage is actually a misnomer because, even within traditional full coverage insurance, there are many different types of coverage, and many optional amounts of each. \\"Full coverage\\" is a layman's misnomer that often results in drivers and vehicle owners being woefully underinsured. Most responsible insurance agents or brokers do not use this term when working with their clients.\\r\\nOne common misconception in the United States is that vehicles that are financed on credit through a bank or credit union are required to have \\"full\\" coverage in order for the financial institution to cover their losses in case of an accident. Insurance requirements vary between financial institutions and each state. Minimum deductibles and liability limits (required by some leasing companies) would be outlined in the loan contract. Failure to carry the required coverages may lead to the lienholder purchasing insurance and adding the cost to the monthly payments or repossession of the vehicle. Vehicles purchased with cash or paid off by the owner are generally required to only carry liability. In some cases, vehicles financed through a \\"buy-here-pay-here\\" car dealershipin which the consumer (generally those with poor credit) finances a car and pays the dealer directly without a bankmay require comprehensive and collision depending on the amount owed for the vehicle.\\r\\nCollision coverage provides coverage for vehicles involved in collisions. Collision coverage is subject to a deductible. This coverage is designed to provide payments to repair the damaged vehicle, or payment of the cash value of the vehicle if it is not repairable or totaled. Collision coverage is optional, however if you plan on financing a car or taking a car loan, the lender will usually insist you carry collision for the finance term or until the car is paid off. Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW) is the term used by rental car companies for collision coverage.\\r\\nComprehensive, also known as other than collision coverage, provides coverage, subject to a deductible, for cars damaged by incidents that are not considered collisions. For example, fire, theft (or attempted theft), vandalism, weather, or impacts with animals are types of comprehensive losses.\\r\\nAdditionally, the majority of insurance companies list \\"Acts of God\\" as an aspect of comprehensive coverage. By definition, it includes any events or occurrences that are beyond human control. For example, a tornado, flood, hurricane, or hail storm would fall under this category.\\r\\nUninsured/Underinsured coverage, also known as UM/UIM, provides coverage if an at-fault party either does not have insurance, or does not have enough insurance. In effect, the insurance company pays the insured medical bills, then would subrogate from the at fault party. This coverage is often overlooked and very important. In Colorado, for example, it was estimated in 2009 that 15% of drivers were uninsured.[8] Usually the limits match the liability limits.[citation needed] Some insurance companies do offer UM/UIM in an umbrella policy.\\r\\nSome states maintain unsatisfied judgment funds to provide compensation to those who cannot collect damages from uninsured driver.[9] Typically, the payout is not more than the minimum liability limits and the negligent driver remains responsible for reimbursing the state's fund.\\r\\nIn the United States, the definition of an uninsured/underinsured motorist, and corresponding coverages, are set by state laws. In some states it is mandatory. In the case of underinsured coverage, two different triggers apply: a damages trigger which is based on whether the limits are insufficient to cover the injured party's damages, and a limits trigger which applies when the limits are less than the injured party's limits.[10] According to a 2009 survey by trade association Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, 29 states have a limits trigger while 20 states have a damages trigger.[11] Another variation is whether a particular state requires stacking of policy limits of different vehicles or policies.[11]\\r\\nLoss of use coverage, also known as rental coverage, provides reimbursement for rental expenses associated with having an insured vehicle repaired due to a covered loss.\\r\\nLoan/lease payoff coverage, also known as GAP coverage or GAP insurance,[12][13] was established in the early 1980s to provide protection to consumers based upon buying and market trends.\\r\\nDue to the sharp decline in value immediately following purchase, there is generally a period in which the amount owed on the car loan exceeds the value of the vehicle, which is called \\"upside-down\\" or negative equity. Thus, if the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair at this point, the owner will still owe potentially thousands of dollars on the loan. The escalating price of cars, longer-term auto loans, and the increasing popularity of leasing gave birth to GAP protection. GAP waivers provide protection for consumers when a \\"gap\\" exists between the actual value of their vehicle and the amount of money owed to the bank or leasing company. In many instances, this insurance will also pay the deductible on the primary insurance policy. These policies are often offered at auto dealerships as a comparatively low cost add-on to the car loan that provides coverage for the duration of the loan. GAP Insurance does not always pay off the full loan value however. These cases include but are not limited to:\\r\\nTherefore, it is important for a policy holder to understand that they may still owe on the loan even though the GAP policy was purchased. Failure to understand this can result in the lender continuing their legal remedies to collect the balance and the potential of damaged credit.\\r\\nConsumers should be aware that a few states, including New York, require lenders of leased cars to include GAP insurance within the cost of the lease itself. This means that the monthly price quoted by the dealer must include GAP insurance, whether it is delineated or not. Nevertheless, unscrupulous dealers sometimes prey on unsuspecting individuals by offering them GAP insurance at an additional price, on top of the monthly payment, without mentioning the State's requirements.\\r\\nIn addition, some vendors and insurance companies offer what is called \\"Total Loss Coverage.\\" This is similar to ordinary GAP insurance but differs in that instead of paying off the negative equity on a vehicle that is a total loss, the policy provides a certain amount, usually up to $5000, toward the purchase or lease of a new vehicle. Thus, to some extent the distinction makes no difference, i.e., in either case the owner receives a certain sum of money. However, in choosing which type of policy to purchase, the owner should consider whether, in case of a total loss, it is more advantageous for him or her to have the policy pay off the negative equity or provide a down payment on a new vehicle.\\r\\nFor example, assuming a total loss of a vehicle valued at $15,000, but on which the owner owes $20,000, is the \\"gap\\" of $5000. If the owner has traditional GAP coverage, the \\"gap\\" will be wiped out and he or she may purchase or lease another vehicle or choose not to. If the owner has \\"Total Loss Coverage,\\" he or she will have to personally cover the \\"gap\\" of $5000, and then receive $5000 toward the purchase or lease of a new vehicle, thereby either reducing monthly payments, in the case of financing or leasing, or the total purchase price in the case of outright purchasing. So the decision on which type of policy to purchase will, in most instances, be informed by whether the owner can pay off the negative equity in case of a total loss and/or whether he or she will definitively purchase a replacement vehicle.\\r\\nVehicle towing coverage is also known as roadside assistance coverage. Traditionally, automobile insurance companies have agreed to only pay for the cost of a tow that is related to an accident that is covered under the automobile policy of insurance. This had left a gap in coverage for tows that are related to mechanical breakdowns, flat tires and gas outages. To fill that void, insurance companies started to offer the car towing coverage, which pays for non-accident related tows.\\r\\nPersonal items in a vehicle that are damaged due to an accident typically are not covered under the auto insurance policy. Any type of property that is not attached to the vehicle should be claimed under a home insurance or renters' insurance policy. However, some insurance companies will cover unattached GPS devices intended for automobile use.[citation needed]\\r\\nInsurers use actuarial science to determine the rates, which involves statistical analysis of the various characteristics of drivers.\\r\\nIn the United States, automotive insurance covering liability for injuries and property damage is compulsory in most states, but different states enforce the insurance requirement differently. In Virginia, where insurance is not compulsory, residents must pay the state a $500 annual fee per vehicle if they choose not to buy liability insurance.[14] Penalties for not purchasing insurance vary by state, but often include a substantial fine, license and/or registration suspension or revocation, and possible jail time. Usually, the minimum required by law is third party insurance to protect third parties against the financial consequences of loss, damage or injury caused by a vehicle.\\r\\nCalifornia and New Jersey have enacted \\"Personal Responsibility Acts\\" which put further pressure on all drivers to carry liability insurance by preventing uninsured drivers from recovering non economic damages (e.g. compensation for \\"pain and suffering\\") if they are injured in any way while operating a motor vehicle.\\r\\nNorth Carolina is the only state to require that a driver hold liability insurance before a license can be issued. North Carolina does allow for a \\"fleet license\\" to be issued if the license holder has no insurance, however the fleet license only allows for the driver to operate vehicles owned and insured by their employer. The license holder must produce a state form (DL-123) to prove they have insurance, requiring the signature of an insurance agent, in addition to a ten dollar fee, in order to convert the fleet license to a full license.\\r\\nSome states require that proof of insurance be carried in the car at all times, while others do not. For example, North Carolina does not specify that proof of insurance must be carried in the vehicle; it does, however, require that a driver have that information to trade with another driver in the event of an accident. Some states allow for an electronic insurance card to be produced on a smartphone\\r\\nArizona Department of Transportation Research Project Manager John Semmens has recommended that car insurers issue license plates and be held responsible for the full cost of injuries and property damage caused by their licensees under the Disneyland model. Plates would expire at the end of the insurance coverage period, and licensees would need to return their plates to their insurance office to receive a refund on their premiums. Vehicles driving without insurance would thus be easy to spot because they would not have license plates, or the plates would be past the marked expiration date.[15]\\r\\nWith the invention of the automobile in the late 19th century came the inevitable side effect of automobile collisions.[16] As automotive collisions increased in frequency, it became clear that, unlike other torts, which relied on personal responsibility, there was a possibility that automobiles would need to be governed by laws because \\"[t]here was no way of assuring that even though fault was assessed the victim of an automobile collision would be able to collect from the tortfeasor.\\"[16]\\r\\nThis led Massachusetts and Connecticut to create the first financial responsibility and compulsory insurance laws. Connecticut's 1925 financial responsibility law required any vehicle owner involved in a collision with damages over $100 to prove \\"financial responsibility to satisfy any claim for damages, by reason of personal injury, to, or death of, any person, of at least $10,000.\\"[17] This early financial responsibility requirement only required vehicle owners to prove financial responsibility after their first collision.[16] Massachusetts also introduced a law to address the problem of collisions, but theirs was a compulsory insurance, not financial responsibility law. It required automotive liability insurance as a prerequisite to vehicle registration.[18]\\r\\nUntil 1956, when the New York legislature passed their compulsory insurance law, Massachusetts was the only state in the U.S. that required drivers to get insurance before registration. North Carolina followed suit in 1957 and then in the 1960s and 1970s numerous other states passed similar compulsory insurance laws. Since the genesis of automotive insurance schemes in 1925 nearly every state has adopted a compulsory insurance scheme.[16]\\r\\nAdvocates of compulsory auto insurance rely on the assumption that, at least some of the time, the person at fault in a car accident won't be able to pay for the damage to the other person's car. Because insurance has been mandatory in most states for so long, the data to prove this theory is somewhat sparse. Nevertheless, proponents of compulsory auto insurance argue that:\\r\\nOpponents of compulsory insurance believe that it is not the best way to allocate risk among drivers. New Hampshire and Virginia do not require motor vehicle insurance. In New Hampshire vehicle owners must satisfy a personal responsibility requirement; instead of paying monthly premiums, and prove that they are capable of paying in case of an accident. In Virginia vehicle owners may pay an uninsured motorist fee. In Mississippi vehicle owners may post bonds or cash. Many insurance companies oppose compulsory auto insurance, for example: the NAII (National Association of Independent Insurers). State Farm opposes compulsory auto insurance because it forces poor to choose between groceries and insurance. A study done by Dr Robert Maril showed that, in a poor area of Arizona, 44% said they had trouble buying food or paying rent due to auto insurance. A survey done by the Montana DPHHS showed 12 of the 96 surveyed said auto insurance was a reason for needing food stamps.[19][20]\\r\\nThe tables below contain minimum liability requirements for vehicle owners for states within the United States. They are divided into two categories: compulsory and non compulsory. See the table on the right for an explanation of the values.\\r\\nInsurers may be unwilling to insure drivers (especially at an affordable price) with particularly bad histories, which had led states to create \\"residual market\\" programs through which insurers are required to make insurance available. There are various ways that this is accomplished, with the most common being an assigned risk plan[25] and other programs including joint underwriting associations, reinsurance facilities, and in the case of Maryland a state-owned fund subsidized by insurers.","input":"What us states do not require auto insurance?"},{"output":"Color TV Game","context":"The Japanese multinational consumer electronics company Nintendo has developed seven home video game consoles and multiple portable consoles for use with external media, as well as dedicated consoles and other hardware for their consoles.

The NES restarted the video game industry after the video game crash of 1983, and was an international success. In 1989, Nintendo released the Game Boy, which became the first handheld console to sell in large numbers. In the early 1990s, Nintendo's market lead began to decrease; although the 1990 Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) was a strong seller, the Mega Drive/Genesis was a very strong contender. Nintendo and Sega would both lose a significant portion of the console market towards the end of the 1990s, as Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation became the most popular console, beating the Nintendo 64, though Nintendo managed to sell more than Sega Saturn.\\r\\nThe Dreamcast, released in 1999, PlayStation 2, released in 2000, and Microsoft's Xbox, released in 2001, would eventually relegate Nintendo to third place in the international market, despite the release of the GameCube. However, they retained their lead in the handheld console market, with the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance models. Towards the middle of the 2000s, Nintendo introduced the first successful handheld device with a touch screen (DS) and the first successful console designed for motion controlled inputs (the Wii); they became some of the best-selling consoles of all time. In 2010, Nintendo became the first major company to release a handheld game console with stereoscopic 3D capabilities, with the 3DS, which had very strong sales from the beginning. The Wii U, released in 2012, was much less successful, and sales were significantly lower than predicted. The company's most recent console, Nintendo Switch, was released in March 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Color TV-Game is a series of five dedicated home consoles released only in Japan. Each of the consoles contained a small number of games and a built-in controller. In total, approximately 4 million units were sold.[3] The Color TV-Game series consists of:\\r\\nReleased July 15, 1983, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit video game console released by Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa and was Nintendo's first home video game console released outside Japan. In Japan, it is known as the \\"Family Computer\\" (or \\"Famicom\\", as it is commonly abbreviated). Selling 61.91 million units worldwide, the NES helped revitalize the video game industry following the video game crash of 1983 and set the standard for subsequent consoles in everything from game design to business practices. The NES was the first console for which the manufacturer openly courted third-party developers. Many of Nintendo's most iconic franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda and Metroid were started on the NES. Nintendo continued to repair Famicom consoles in Japan until October 31, 2007, attributing the decision to discontinue support to an increasing shortage of the necessary parts.[4][5][6]\\r\\nNintendo released a software-emulation-based version of the Nintendo Entertainment System on November 10, 2016. Called the NES Classic Edition, it is a dedicated console that comes with a single controller and 30 preloaded games.[7]\\r\\nReleased November 21, 1990, The Super Nintendo Entertainment System, officially abbreviated the Super NES or SNES and colloquially shortened to Super Nintendo, is a 16-bit video game console released by Nintendo in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Oceania and Africa. In Japan it is known as the Super Famicom. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.\\r\\nThe Super NES was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System. Whereas the earlier console had struggled in the PAL region and large parts of Asia, the Super NES was a global success, albeit one that could not match its predecessor's popularity in Northeast Asia and North Americadue in part to increased competition from Sega's Genesis console (released in Europe as the Mega Drive). Despite its relatively late start, the Super NES became the best selling console of the 16-bit era, selling 49.10 million systems worldwide.[1] The Super NES library is known for upgrading some of Nintendo's most famous franchises, and making the games even more critically acclaimed, such as Super Metroid, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy IV and VI, Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario World, as well starting some popular franchises such as Star Fox and Mega Man X.\\r\\nReleased June 23, 1996, The Nintendo 64, commonly called the N64, and codenamed Ultra 64, was Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. It was released with three launch games in Japan (Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 and Saikyo Habu Shogi) and two in North America (Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64). PAL regions also had three launch titles (Super Mario 64, Shadows of the Empire and Pilotwings 64) with Turok: Dinosaur Hunter delayed until three days after launch. Other key games included Donkey Kong 64, Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo-Kazooie, two games in The Legend of Zelda series, GoldenEye 007, Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros. and Star Fox 64. The Nintendo 64 sold 32.93 million systems.[1]\\r\\nThe Nintendo GameCube (commonly shortened to GameCube, NGC or GCN) is Nintendo's sixth generation game console, the same generation as Sega's Dreamcast, Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox. Until the console's unveiling at SpaceWorld 2000, the design project was known as Dolphinthis can still be seen in the console and its accessories' model numbers. The GameCube is the most compact sixth generation console. The GameCube is Nintendo's first game console to use optical discs rather than game cartridges. An agreement with the optical drive manufacturer Matsushita led to a DVD-playing GameCube system named the Panasonic Q, which was only released in Japan. Much of Nintendo's core line-up centered on sequels to their established hit franchises such as Super Mario Sunshine, Super Smash Bros. Melee, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Metroid Prime, Pokmon Colosseum and Star Fox Adventures, while new franchises like Animal Crossing and Pikmin were born, although the former franchise had seen a Japan-exclusive release on the N64. The GameCube has sold 21.74 million units.[1]\\r\\nThe Wii was released on November 19, 2006 as Nintendo's seventh-generation home console. Nintendo designed the console to appeal towards a wider audience than those of its main competitors, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, including \\"casual\\" players and audiences that were new to video games.[8][9]\\r\\nThese aims were emphasized by the console's distinguishing feature, the Wii Remotea handheld motion controller that can detect motion and rotation in three dimensions, using a mixture of internal sensors and infrared positioning. The controller includes an expansion port that can be used to connect other accessories, such as the Nunchukan attachment with an analog stick and additional buttons, a \\"Classic Controller\\" gamepad providing a traditional control scheme, and Wii MotionPlusan accessory designed to enhance the motion detection capabilities of the original Wii Remote models.[8][9]\\r\\nThe Wii's internal hardware is an updated derivative of that of the GameCube; in comparison to its seventh-generation competitors, the Wii had lower overall graphics capabilities, and does not output in high-definition.[10][8] The Wii also featured internet-enabled features; the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service allowed supported games to offer online multiplayer and other features, while the WiiConnect24 feature allowed messages and updates to be downloaded while the console was in standby. Through Wii Shop Channel, additional games and apps can be downloaded or purchased for the console, including Virtual Consolea selection of classic video games emulated from older consoles. Early models of the Wii also had backwards compatibility with GameCube games and controllers, but this was dropped from later hardware revisions.\\r\\nThe Wii was a major success for Nintendo; in April 2007, the Wall Street Journal declared that Nintendo had \\"become the company to beat in the games business\\", citing the success of the Wii and the portable Nintendo DS line.[11] As of December 31, 2013, the Wii had sold 100.90 million units worldwide.[1] Wii Sportsa collection of sports minigames that were designed to leverage the Wii Remote, was bundled with the console outside of Japan, and had a major cultural impact as the console's \\"killer app\\" among the mainstream audience.[12][13]\\r\\nThe Wii U was released on November 18, 2012 as a direct successor to the Wii, and the first entry in the eighth generation of home video game consoles. The Wii U's distinguishing hardware feature is the GamePad, a tablet-like controller which contains a touchscreen that wirelessly streams a video output from the console. The GamePad's display can be used to provide alternative or complimentary perspectives within a game, or as the main display in lieu of a television.[14][15] In particular, Nintendo promoted the concept of \\"asymmetric\\" multiplayer, where a player with the GamePad would have a different objective and perspective than that of other players.[16] Alongside the GamePad, the Wii U supports Wii controllers and games. A conventional gamepad known as the Wii U Pro Controller was also released.[17][18][15]\\r\\nThe Wii U features more-extensive online functionality than the Wii, using the Nintendo Network platform; as with the Wii, it supports online multiplayer and downloading and purchasing new games and apps, but also allows video chat, and features an internal social network known as Miiverse, which allows users to write and draw posts in game-specific communities.[19][20][21][22] Nintendo also attempted to provide second screen experiences for television programming for the Wii U through a feature known as Nintendo TVii,[23][24] but it was discontinued outside of Japan in August 2015.[25] Unlike the Wii, the Wii U's hardware is capable of high-definition graphics.[15]\\r\\nThe Wii U received an initially tepid response, credited to a weak launch lineup, diminishing third-party commitment to the platform, as well as the subsequent release of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One the following year.[26][27] However, some critics argued that the Wii U still had advantages over PS4 and Xbox One, including its lower cost and notable early exclusives such as Super Mario 3D World.[28][29] Sales steadily increased following the release of several notable first-party exclusives, including new entries in the Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros. franchises,[30][31][32] and the new franchise Splatoon.[33]\\r\\nIn January 2017, a Nintendo spokesperson stated that production of the console had ended, with just 13.94 million units sold.[34][35]\\r\\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid device that can be used as a home console inserted to the Nintendo Switch Dock attached to a television, stood up on a table with the kickstand, or as a tablet-like portable console. It features two detachable wireless controllers called Joy-Cons, that can be used individually or attached to a grip to provide a more traditional game pad form. Both Joy-Cons are built with motion sensors and HD Rumble, Nintendo's haptic vibration feedback system for improved gameplay experiences. However, only the right Joy-Con has an NFC reader on its analog joystick for Amiibo and an IR sensor on the back. The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a traditional style controller much like the one of the Gamecube. The console's reveal trailer[36] premiered on October 20, 2016 and showcased the hybrid functionality of the system as well as footage from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and from potential new titles in the Super Mario, Mario Kart, and Splatoon franchises. These unknown games were later announced to be Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Splatoon 2 respectively.\\r\\nThe Game & Watch series were handheld electronic games made by Nintendo and created by its game designer Gunpei Yokoi from 1980 to 1991. Most featured a single game that could be played on an LCD screen, in addition to a clock and an alarm. Most titles had a \\"GAME A\\" and a \\"GAME B\\" button. Game B is usually a faster, more difficult version of Game A. Different models were manufactured, with some consoles having two screens (the Multiscreen Series) and a clam-shell design. The Nintendo DS later reused this design. The Game & Watch made handhelds vastly popular. Many toy companies followed in the footsteps of Game & Watch, such as Tiger Electronics and their Star Wars themed games. Nintendo's Game & Watch units were eventually superseded by the original Game Boy. Each Game & Watch was only able to play one game, due to the use of a segmented LCD display being pre-printed with an overlay. The speed and responsiveness of the games was also limited by the time it took the LCD to change state. The Game & Watch sold over 80 million units worldwide.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Game Boy was the first handheld game console sold by Nintendo that featured interchangeable cartridges for each game, unlike the Game & Watch that had a different system for each game. Released in 1989 in Japan, it is one of the world's best-selling game console lines, with over 100 million units sold worldwide.[1] The classic Game Boy was sold in a number of different revisions and variations, including the streamlined Game Boy Pocket and the Game Boy Light in Japan. In 1998, Nintendo released the Game Boy Color, a new Game Boy platform with color graphics. Combined,[37] the Game Boy and Game Boy Color sold 118.69 million units worldwide.[1]\\r\\nNintendo's Virtual Boy (also known as the VR-32 during development) was the first portable game console capable of displaying true 3D graphics. Most video games are forced to use monocular cues to achieve the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional screen, but the Virtual Boy was able to create a more accurate illusion of depth through an effect known as parallax. The Nintendo 3DS also uses this technology. In a manner similar to using a head-mounted display, the user looks into an eyepiece made of neoprene on the front of the machine, and then an eyeglass-style projector allows viewing of the monochromatic (in this case, red) image. It was released on July 21, 1995 in Japan and August 14, 1995 in North America and at a price of around US$180. It met with a lukewarm reception that was unaffected by continued price drops. Exactly 14 titles were released for Virtual Boy in North America, but only a few were met with positive reception. The system is rarely mentioned by Nintendo, however it is seen through microgames in WarioWare games. Nintendo discontinued the Virtual Boy within a few months of release.\\r\\nIn 1998, Nintendo introduced the Game Boy Color as the successor to the original Game Boy.[38] It features a color screen and an 8-bit processor and a custom Zilog Z80 central processing unit.[39] It was made to compete with the WonderSwan Color and the Neo Geo Pocket. Its best selling game was Pokmon Gold and Silver series.[40][41]\\r\\nIn 2001, Nintendo introduced the Game Boy Advance, the first major technological upgrade to the Game Boy line. Nintendo later released two revised models of the Game Boy Advance, the Game Boy Advance SP and the Game Boy Micro. The Game Boy Advance SP features a smaller clamshell design, and introduced a built-in screen light and rechargeable battery which became standard features for future Nintendo handhelds. The Game Boy Micro is an even smaller variant with interchangeable designer faceplates. The three Game Boy Advance models have sold 81.51 million units worldwide.[1]\\r\\nThe Nintendo DS (abbreviated NDS, DS, or the full name Nintendo Dual Screen, and iQue DS in China) is a handheld game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo, released in 2004. It is visibly distinguishable by its horizontal clamshell design, and the presence of two displays, the lower of which acts as a touchscreen. The system also has a built-in microphone and supports wireless IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standards, allowing players to interact with each other within short range (10ÿ30 meters, depending on conditions) or over the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service via a standard Wi-Fi access point. According to Nintendo, the letters \\"DS\\" in the name stand for \\"Developers' System\\" and \\"Double Screen\\", the former of which refers to the features of the handheld designed to encourage innovative gameplay ideas among developers.[42] The system was known as \\"Project Nitro\\" during development.\\r\\nOn March 2, 2006, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS Lite, a redesigned model of the Nintendo DS, in Japan. It was later released in North America, Australia and Europe.\\r\\nAs of December 31, 2013, Nintendo DS consoles have sold 153.98 million units, including 93.86 million Nintendo DS Lites.[1]\\r\\nA second redesign of the Nintendo DS, the Nintendo DSi, was released on November 1, 2008, in Japan, on April 2, 2009 in Australia, April 3, 2009 in Europe, and April 5, 2009 in North America. It contains two cameras and downloadable software capabilities, plus a built-in flash memory and web browser. An SD card slot replaces the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot. A similar model, known as the Nintendo DSi XL, was released in 2010. It features the same configurations as its predecessor, but is slightly larger and features a large stylus designed for home use. As of December 31, 2013, Nintendo DSi consoles have sold 41.33 million units.[1]\\r\\nAlthough the name and look of the device are similar to that of the DS series, the Nintendo 3DS (or shortly 3DS) is the successor to the DS and a brand new console. It contains three cameras, two on the outside (for 3D photographs) and one internal one above the top screen. The bottom screen is a touch screen comparable to the DS bottom screens, and the top screen is Wide Screen and an autostereoscopic 3D LCD. Autostereoscopy is a process that sends different images to the left and right eyes to enable the viewer to view the screen in 3D \\"without the need for special glasses\\". The 3DS is said to enhance Nintendo's online experience. In 2012, the 3DS XL was released, similar to the change between the DSi and DSi XL. It has 90% larger screens and design changes such as a matte finish and the stylus in a more accessible area. The 2DS was released on October 12, 2013. It is a variant designed to be affordable without the clamshell design or 3D capabilities of the 3DS. Another redesign, the New Nintendo 3DS, was released in Japan in October 2014, Australia for November 2014, and everywhere else in February 2015. It includes a C-Stick, ZR and ZL shoulder buttons, and a faster CPU, allowing for more software specifically for the New Nintendo 3DS (such as Xenoblade Chronicles 3D). Like the original 3DS, the New Nintendo 3DS also has an XL form. As of December 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold 42.74 million units, including 15.21 million Nintendo 3DS XLs and 2.11 million Nintendo 2DS units.[1].\\r\\nThe latest handheld console from Nintendo is the New Nintendo 2DS XL, which was released in July 2017 across five different countries.\\r\\nThe Nintendo Switch is a hybrid home and portable console.

The expedition, led by Chris Fischer, founder and CEO of Fischer Productions, along with Captain Brett McBride and Dr. Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute, took measurements, gathered DNA samples, and fastened real-time satellite tags to the great white sharks. This allowed Dr. Domeier to study migratory patterns, especially those associated with mating and birthing, over a five-year period.[37]\\r\\nIn March 2010, Walker went to Constituci܇n, Chile, to offer his help and support to the people injured in the 8.8 magnitude earthquake that struck on February 27.

He graduated from Bergenfield High School in 1951.[1] Thompson worked for the A&P supermarket [2]:19 before he was drafted by the United States Army on June 14, 1956.[2]:28 He was at first a very truculent, rebellious soldier, but then decided that he liked the military. After basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, he decided to make the military his career.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter completing Officer Candidate School,[2]:32 Thompson served stateside and also spent a year in Korea.[2]:37 He was stationed at Fort Bragg when he was recruited into the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret.[2]:41 After completing Ranger School and Jump School, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, from August 1958 to June 1960. His next assignment was as a Platoon Leader in the 2nd Brigade of the 34th Infantry Regiment, stationed in South Korea from June 1960 to July 1961. Thompson then served as a reenlistment officer with Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from September 1961 to September 1962, and then as a staff officer with 1st Special Forces at Fort Bragg, from September 1962 to December 1963.[3]\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain Thompson went to Vietnam in December 1963.[2]:52 Prior to his deployment, he hadn't heard of the country. He was to serve only a six-month tour of duty but was captured on March 26, 1964. He was released on March 16, 1973, 10 days short of 9 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 26, 1964, Thompson was a passenger on an observation plane (an L-19/O-1 Bird Dog) flown by Captain Richard L. Whitesides when it was downed by enemy small arms fire at 163912N 1064621E? / ?16.65333N 106.77250E? / 16.65333; 106.77250, about 20 kilometers from Thompson's Special Forces Camp near Quang Tri, South Vietnam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson survived the crash with burns, a bullet wound across the cheek, and a broken back. He was quickly captured by the Viet Cong. Whitesides was never found; he was awarded the Air Force Cross for a previous mission but was killed before it could be presented to him. He was the first American to be killed in action at Khe Sanh, South Vietnam.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nAerial search and ground patrols failed to find any trace of the aircraft.[2]:94\\r\\n\\r\\nOn March 27, 1964, an Army officer visited Thompson's home and told his pregnant wife Alyce that he was missing. The trauma sent her into labor and their son was born that evening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson spent the next nine years (3,278 days) as a prisoner of war, first at the hands of the Viet Cong in the South Vietnam jungles, until he was moved in 1967 to the Hanoi prison system.[5] During his captivity, he was tortured, starved, and isolated from other American POWs.[6] At one point, Thompson did not speak to another American for over five years. He was released with the other POWs in mid-March 1973 in Operation Homecoming.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe years following Thompson's release were not happy ones. His troubled life was chronicled in an oral biography called Glory Denied by Tom Philpott. Although Thompson was promoted to lieutenant colonel upon release and then to full colonel, he had missed the most important years of his military career while in prison. He had no formal military education beyond OCS and lacked even a college degree or experience as a company commander.[2]:295\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had difficulty adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson's marriage had been troubled even before his captivity, and his wife Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man at the time he was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband's mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children.[7] Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed any kind of a relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely remembered him. He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThompson said that one of the things that helped him cope with his brutal imprisonment was thinking of the fine family that awaited his return. He developed a very serious drinking problem and was in several military hospitals for treatment.[2]:349\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1977, Thompson attempted suicide with an overdose of pills and alcohol.[2]:430 His superiors told author Philpott that had it not been for Thompson's status as a hero, he would have been dismissed from service because of his alcoholism. In 1981, while still on active duty, Thompson suffered a massive heart attack and a severe stroke. He was in a coma for months and was left seriously disabled. He was paralyzed on one side and could speak only in brief phrases for the rest of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stroke that left Thompson's left side paralyzed[2]:431 and his age contributed to his forced retirement from active duty in the Army.  A ceremony was held for him in The Pentagon on January 28, 1982.  Thompson received the Distinguished Service Medal in appreciation for his 25 years of service to his country as an Army officer.[8] Because of his recent stroke, he had a hard time speaking, so Michael Chamowitz, his close friend and lawyer, read his retirement speech.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am honored to receive this award (the Distinguished Service Medal) today but at the same time I am saddened to be leaving active military service. The Army has been my life and I am proud of each of my twenty-five years of service.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf those 25 years, I spent nine as prisoner of war. Those days were grim, and survival was a struggle. I was able to withstand that long agony because I never lost my determination to liveno matter how painful that becamebecause I love my country and never lost faith in her, and because I had dreams of what my life would be like upon my return to America. Those dreams were always, unquestionably, of a life that was Army. I found that the dream of continued service gave me a goal that helped me survive my years as a POW.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter my return from Vietnam, the opportunity to serve became the motivating force in my life. Military service has given me my greatest challenges and my greatest rewards. I have worked hard for sound leadership development in the Army and for realistic training. The greatest problem faced by POWs was fear of the unknown. This fear can be reduced, not only for the potential POW but across the awesome environment of the battlefield, by training which is honest enough to address the real issue of combat and which is tough enough to approximate battlefield conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I do not now retire freelythere was much I still wanted to dobut circumstances present me no alternative. I leave active military service because I must. But for the rest of my life, the Army will be no less a part of me, and of what I am, than what it has always been.\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Floyd James Thompson\\r\\n\\r\\nJanuary 29, 1982[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1981, Thompson moved to Key West, where he remained active in the community, according to the Monroe County Office of Veterans Affairs. In 1988, Thompson and a number of other former prisoners of war were awarded medals by President Ronald Reagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1990, Thompson's son Jim was convicted of murder and imprisoned for sixteen years.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 8, 2002, the staff of JIATF (Joint Interagency Task Force) East and some of his close friends threw Thompson a birthday party. He was described as being in high spirits and full of excitement. During the celebration, he quoted General Douglas MacArthur: \\"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEight days later, Thompson was found dead in his Key West By the Sea Condominium on July 16, 2002, at the age of 69. His body was cremated, and his ashes scattered at sea off the coast of Florida. There is a memorial marker for him at Andersonville National Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an update to Glory Denied, Tom Philpott reported that Alyce Thompson died of cancer in 2009. He also mentioned that Thompson's daughter Ruth had suffered three disabling heart attacks and had lost a son to suicide. Philpott reported that Ruth had told him the strength of character that she inherited from both her parents had helped her though the difficult times. Glory Denied was later turned into an opera [11] written by Tom Cipullo.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn November 2014, Thompson's pilot Richard L. Whitesides' remains were recovered in the area where he was lost on March 26, 1964 and have been identified. They were returned to his family for burial with full military honors at West Point Cemetery.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn October 1974, Thompson started to receive medals and awards in recognition for his service in Vietnam. South Vietnam gave him the country's highest award to Allied enlisted military personnel for valor, the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal.[13]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn recognition of his escape from Viet Cong POW camp for two days in October 1971, Thompson received the Silver Star.[2] For his nine years in captivity, Thompson received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal, and Legion of Merit. The Bronze Star recognized his continuous resistance to the enemy. The Legion of Merit recognized his suffering for his nine years in captivity.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nA ceremony was held on June 24, 1988, in the White House honoring POWs from World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Two representatives were picked from each war to receive the Prisoner of War Medal. Thompson and Everett Alvarez were chosen to represent POWs from Vietnam.[14]\\r\\n\\r\\nHis military decorations and awards include:","input":"Who was the longest prisoner held captive in vietnam?"},{"output":"Beauceron","context":"The Beauceron is a guard dog and herding dog breed falling into the working dog category whose origins lie in the plains of Northern France. The Beauceron is also known as Berger de Beauce (sheepdog from Beauce) or  Bas Rouge (red-stockings).\\r\\n\\r\\nA French herding breed known for centuries in western Europe, the Beauceron is noted as one of the breeds used to create the Doberman Pinscher. The regional name is somewhat misleading: the breed was found throughout northern France, rather than just in the Beauce region. Although quite different in appearance, the Beauceron and the long-haired sheep dog, the Briard, stem from similar ancestral stock, sharing the trait of double dewclaws on the hind legs. Both were used to herd sheep and cattle. Like the Beauceron, the Briard is found throughout northern France, and despite implications from its name, also did not come exclusively from the Brie region.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1809, Abb Rozier wrote an article on these French herding dogs, in which he described the differences in type and used the terms Berger de Brie and Berger de Beauce.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1893, the veterinarian Paul Megnin differentiated between the long-haired Berger de la Brie and the short-haired Berger de Beauce. He defined the standard of the breed, with the assistance of M. Emmanuel Ball. In 1922, the Club des Amis du Beauceron was formed under the guidance of Dr. Megnin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008, the Beauceron made its debut in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.\\r\\n\\r\\nA versatile breed, the Bas Rouge is used to both guard and herd sheep and cattle. It was once very useful against wolves, now long gone from northern France. The breed served in both world wars as messenger dog, supply transport dog, land mine detection dog, search dog, police dog and rescue dog.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis breed stands 61 to 70?cm (24 to 27.5?inches) in height and weighs 30 to 45?kg (66 to 100 pounds). The Beauceron has a hard outer coat and a woolly undercoat that grows thick in cold weather, especially if the dog sleeps outdoors. Its standard colouring is black and tan (the latter colour referred to in French as rouge ecureuil, squirrel-red) or grey, black and tan called harlequin. Other colours, such as the once prevalent tawny, grey or grey/black, are now banned by the breed standard. The merle coats should have more black than gray with no white. In the black and tan dogs the tan markings appear in two dots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, fading off to the cheeks, but do not reach the underside of the ears. Also on the throat, under the tail and on the legs and the chest. Tan markings on the chest should appear as two spots but a chest plate is acceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough most breeds may or may not have dewclaws (many owners of other breeds remove dewclaws, especially if the dog is used for field and hunting), an important feature of the Beauceron is the double dewclaw. In order to be shown, a beauceron must have double dewclaws that form well-separated \\"thumbs\\" with nails on each rear leg; anything less will result in disqualification from dog shows.[1][2][3]\\r\\n\\r\\nEar cropping is no longer allowed in Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Beauceron is known in France as a guard dog, a helper around the farm (herding sheep or cattle), and/or a ring sport dog (primarily protection training). This athletic, healthy and long-lived breed has been bred to be intelligent, calm, gentle, and fearless.[4] Adults are typically suspicious of strangers and are excellent natural guard dogs. On the other hand, they typically take their cue from their handlers when it comes to greeting strangers, and are neither sharp nor shy. They do best when raised within the family but they can sleep outside, the better to act as guards (their weatherproof coats make them ideal kennel users even in the coldest winters). They are eager learners and can be trained to a high level. However, their physical and mental development is slow, relative to other similar breeds (e.g. German and other large shepherds): they are not mentally or physically mature until the age of about three years, so their training should not be rushed. Several five- or ten-minute play-training exercises per day in the early years can achieve better results than long or rigorous training sessions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaucerons can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Beaucerons exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.[5]","input":"What breed of dog is bosco in marmaduke?"},{"output":"Richard Shannon Hoon","context":"Richard Shannon Hoon (September 26, 1967 ÿ October 21, 1995) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. He was the lead singer of the band Blind Melon until his death in 1995.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHoon was born in Lafayette, Indiana and raised in nearby Dayton, Indiana with his half-sister, Anna, and half-brother, Tim. He reportedly began using his middle name, Shannon, to avoid confusion with his father, who was also named Richard. In high school, he played football, wrestled, and was a pole vaulter. Shannon's musical influences included the Grateful Dead, The Beatles, John Lennon, and Bob Dylan. After graduating from McCutcheon High School in 1985, Hoon joined a local glam metal band named Styff Kytten, which also featured guitarist Michael Kelsey. He took on the role of frontman and lead singer of the band. It was around this time that he wrote his first song and called it \\"Change.\\" He was also a member of the Lafayette band Mank Rage, along with David Lank and Darren Mickler, during this time.\\r\\nIn 1985, Hoon, 18, left Indiana for Los Angeles.[3] In Los Angeles, he met musicians Brad Smith and Rogers Stevens at a party. Smith and Stevens saw Hoon perform his song \\"Change\\" acoustically and invited Hoon to play with them. Christopher Thorn and Glen Graham were then brought into the fold, and by 1990 the five musicians decided to form Blind Melon. The band was possibly named for a term Smith's father used to describe the neighborhood stoners; or for Blind Melon Chitlin, a character from a Cheech & Chong album.[contradictory] In 1990, the new bandmates produced a four-song demo tape and subsequently signed a $500,000 recording contract with Capitol Records.\\r\\nIn Los Angeles, Hoon befriended his sister Anna's high school friend, Axl Rose. Rose invited Hoon to join him in the studio, where his band Guns N' Roses were recording their albums Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II (both released in 1991). Hoon sang backing vocals on several of the tracks, including \\"The Garden\\" and \\"Don't Cry.\\" Rose also invited Hoon to appear in the video for \\"Don't Cry.\\"\\r\\nIn 1992, Blind Melon released their self-titled debut album produced by Pearl Jam producer Rick Parashar. Blind Melon began touring to promote the album, supporting and opening for acts like Ozzy Osbourne, Guns N' Roses, and Soundgarden over the course of 1992ÿ1993. In the summer of 1992, the video for the album track \\"No Rain\\" was released as a single. The video for \\"No Rain\\" focused on a theme of the \\"normal\\" crowd versus the lonely outcast. It featured a young girl, played by Heather DeLoach, in a bee costume, tap dancing to unappreciative audiences, who finally finds an entire crowd of people similarly dressed who welcome her. The video is often referred to as the 'Bee Girl'. Blind Melon went multi-platinum.\\r\\nHoon and Blind Melon spent the next two years touring. In 1993, Hoon was arrested for indecent exposure after he disrobed onstage and urinated on a fan at a show in Vancouver.[4]\\r\\nIn 1994, Blind Melon appeared at Woodstock '94 where Hoon, allegedly high on LSD, went onstage wearing his girlfriend's white dress.[5]\\r\\nAfter taking a hiatus from touring, Blind Melon returned to the studio to record the album Soup in New Orleans. Soup was released in 1995.\\r\\nOn July 11, 1995, Hoon and his girlfriend, Lisa Crouse, had a daughter named Nico Blue.[6] Before the birth of his daughter, Hoon entered rehab again. In August, Blind Melon planned to tour to support their album Soup, so Hoon allowed a drug counselor to accompany him on the road.[7] The counselor, unable to keep Hoon from relapsing, was dismissed days before Hoon's death.\\r\\nAfter a disappointing performance in Houston on October 20, Hoon launched himself into an all-night drug binge.[7] The next day, Saturday, October 21, 1995, Blind Melon was scheduled to play a show in New Orleans at Tipitina's. The band's sound engineer, Lyle Eaves, went to the tour bus to awaken Hoon for a sound check, but Hoon was unresponsive. An ambulance arrived, and Hoon was pronounced dead at the scene, at the age of 28.[8] The cause of death was attributed to a cocaine overdose.\\r\\nHoon was buried at Dayton Cemetery in Dayton, Indiana.

The Netherlands had proclaimed neutrality when war broke out in September 1939, just as it had in World War I, but Adolf Hitler ordered it to be invaded anyway.[1] On 14 May 1940, one day after the bombing of Rotterdam, the Dutch forces surrendered. The Dutch government and the royal family saved themselves by going to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the defeat, the Netherlands was placed under German occupation, which endured in some areas until the German surrender in May 1945. Active resistance was carried out by a minority, which grew in the course of the occupation.  The occupiers deported the majority of the country's Jews to Nazi concentration camps.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the high variation in the survival rate of Jewish inhabitants amongst local regions in the Netherlands, scholars have questioned the validity of a single explanation at the national level. Nonetheless, and also due to the well-organized population registers comparing to other countries, about 70% of the country's Jewish population were killed during the conflict, a much higher percentage than comparable countries, like Belgium and France.[3] However, uniquely within all German occupied areas, the city of Amsterdam organized an industrial action to protest the persecution of its Jewish citizens. \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the south of the country was liberated in the second half of 1944. The rest, especially the west and north of the country still under occupation, suffered from a famine at the end of 1944, known as the \\"Hunger Winter\\". On 5 May 1945, the whole country was finally liberated by the total surrender of all German forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nDutch governments between 1929 and 1943 were dominated by Christian and center-right political parties.[4] From 1933, the Netherlands were hit by the Great Depression, which had begun in 1929.[4] The incumbent government of Hendrikus Colijn pursued a programme of extensive cuts to maintain the value of the Guilder, resulting in workers' riots in Amsterdam and a naval mutiny between 1933 and 1934.[4] Eventually, in 1936, the government was forced to abandon the gold standard and devalue the currency.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nNumerous fascist movements emerged in the Netherlands during the Great Depression era, inspired by Italian Fascism or German Nazism. Nevertheless, they never attracted enough members to be an effective mass-movement, though the pro-Nazi movement, supported by the Nazi Party which took power in Germany in 1933, attempted to in 1935. Nazi-style racial ideology had limited appeal in the Netherlands, as did its calls to violence.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interwar period also saw a significant increase in civil infrastructure projects and land reclamation, including the Zuiderzee Works, which led to the final draining of seawater from the Wieringermeerpolder, and the completion of the Afsluitdijk dike.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nGerman guarantee of neutrality, 6 October 1939[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War I, the Dutch government under Pieter Cort van der Linden had managed to preserve the Dutch neutrality throughout the conflict.[7] In the inter-war period, the Netherlands had continued to pursue its \\"Independence Policy\\", even after the rise to power of the Nazi Party in Germany in 1933.[8] The conservative prime minister Colijn, who held power from 1933 until 1939, believed the Netherlands would never be able to withstand an attack by a major power, and military spending accordingly remained a low priority.[9] Even though military spending was doubled between 1938 and 1939, amid the rising international tensions, it still constituted only 4% of national spending in 1939, in contrast to nearly 25% in Nazi-ruled Germany.[9] The Dutch government believed it would be able to rely on its neutrality, or at least the informal support of foreign powers, to defend its interests in case of war.[9] The government did, however, begin to work on plans for the defence of the country.[10] This included the \\"New Dutch Waterline\\", an area to the east of Amsterdam which would be flooded, and, from 1939, fortified positions, including the Grebbe and Peel-Raam Lines, protecting the key cities of Dordrecht, Utrecht, Haarlem and Amsterdam and creating a Vesting Holland (or \\"Fortress Holland\\").[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn late 1939, with war already declared between the British Empire, France and Nazi Germany, the German government issued a guarantee of neutrality to the Netherlands.[6] Nevertheless, the Dutch military was gradually mobilized from August 1939, reaching its full strength by April 1940.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite its policy of neutrality, the Netherlands was invaded on the morning of 10 May 1940, without a formal declaration of war, by German forces moving simultaneously into Belgium and Luxembourg.[11] The attackers meant to draw Allied forces away from the Ardennes and to lure British and French forces deeper into Belgium but also to pre-empt a possible British invasion in North Holland. The Luftwaffe also needed the Dutch airfields on the Dutch coast to launch air raids against the United Kingdom.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch military, with insufficient and outdated weapons and equipment, was caught largely unprepared.[10] Much of its weaponry had not changed since the First World War.[12] In particular, the army did not have comparable armoured forces, with only a limited number of armoured cars and tankettes.[13] The air force had only 140 aircraft, mostly outdated biplanes.[14] Sixty-five of the Dutch aircraft were destroyed on the first day of the campaign.[15]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe invading forces advanced rapidly but faced significant resistance. A Wehrmacht parachute assault on the first day, aimed at capturing the Dutch government in The Hague and the key airfields at Ockenburg and Ypenburg, was defeated by Dutch ground forces with heavy casualties.[16] The Dutch actually succeeded in destroying significant numbers of transport aircraft that the Germans would need for their planned invasion of Britain. Nevertheless, the German forces succeeded in crossing the Maas river in the Netherlands on the first day, which allowed the Wehrmacht to outflank the nearby Belgian Fort Eben-Emael and force the Belgian army to withdraw from the German border.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the eastern Netherlands, the Germans succeeded in pushing the Dutch back from the Grebbe Line, but their advance was slowed by the Dutch fortifications on the narrow Afsluitdijk Causeway linking the north-eastern and north-western parts of the Netherlands.[18] Nevertheless, the German forces advanced rapidly, and by the fourth day were in control of most of the east of the country, though not the major cities in the west.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the Dutch, it became increasingly clear that British and French troops would not be able to reach the Netherlands in sufficient numbers to halt the invasion, particularly given the speed of the German advance into Belgium.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nFighting in Rotterdam had taken place since the first day of the campaign, when German infantrymen in seaplanes landed on the Maas river and captured several bridges intact. Nevertheless, the Germans were uneasy about risking a tank attack on the city and feared heavy casualties. Instead, the German commander presented an ultimatum to the Dutch commander in the city. He demanded the surrender of the Dutch garrison and threatened to destroy the city by aerial bombing if they did not accept.[19] The ultimatum was returned on a technicality, since it had not been signed by the German commander.[19] While the corrected ultimatum was being resubmitted, Luftwaffe bombers (unaware that negotiations were ongoing) struck the city.[19] During the so-called \\"Rotterdam Blitz\\", between 800 and 900 Dutch civilians were killed, and 25,000 homes were destroyed.[19] The bombers' target was the civilian areas of Rotterdam, rather than the town's defenses.[19] Under pressure from local officials, the garrison commander then surrendered the city and his 10,000 men on the evening of the 14th, with the permission of Henri Winkelman, the Dutch commander-in-chief, opening up the German advance into \\"Fortress Holland\\".[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch high command was shocked by the Rotterdam Blitz. Knowing the army was running low on supplies and ammunition, and after receiving news that the city of Utrecht had been given an ultimatum similar to that of Rotterdam,[15] Winkelman held a meeting with other Dutch generals. It was decided that further resistance was futile. In the afternoon of 14 May, Winkelman issued a proclamation to his army, ordering them to surrender:\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 15 May, the Netherlands officially signed the surrender with Germany, although Dutch forces in the province of Zeeland, which had come under French control, continued fighting alongside French forces until 17 May, when the bombardment of the town of Middelburg forced them to surrender also. The Dutch Empire, in particular the Dutch East Indies, supported the Allied side and were unaffected by the surrender. Many ships of the Royal Dutch Navy in Dutch waters fled to the United Kingdom.[21]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the four-day campaign, about 2,300 Dutch soldiers were killed and 7,000 wounded, while over 3,000 Dutch civilians also died. The invading army lost 2,200 men killed and 7,000 wounded. In addition, 1,300 German soldiers captured by the Dutch during the campaign, many around The Hague, had been shipped to Britain and remained POWs for the rest of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueen Wilhelmina and the Dutch government succeeded in escaping from the Netherlands before the surrender and formed a government-in-exile.\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the refusal of the Dutch government to return, the Netherlands was controlled by a German civilian governor, unlike France or Denmark which had their own governments, and Belgium, which was under German military control. The civil government, the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, was headed by the Austrian Nazi Arthur Seyss-Inquart. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe German occupiers implemented a policy of Gleichschaltung (\\"enforced conformity\\"), and systematically eliminated non-Nazi organizations. In 1940, the German regime more or less immediately outlawed all Socialist and Communist parties; in 1941, it forbade all parties, except for the Dutch National Socialist party NSB.\\r\\n\\r\\nGleichschaltung was an enormous shock to the Dutch, who had traditionally had separate institutions for all main religious groups, particularly Catholic and Protestant, because of decades of pillarisation. The process was opposed by the Catholic Church in the Netherlands, and, in 1941, all Roman Catholics were urged by Dutch bishops to leave associations that had been Nazified.\\r\\n\\r\\nA long-term aim of the Nazis was to incorporate the Netherlands into the Greater Germanic Reich.[22] Hitler thought very highly of the Dutch people, who were considered to be fellow members of the Aryan \\"master race\\".[23]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Luftwaffe was especially interested in the Netherlands, as the country was designated to become the main area for the air force bases from which to attack the United Kingdom. The Germans started construction of 10 so-called Fliegerhorst?(nl), major military airports, on the day after the formal Dutch surrender, 15 May 1940. Each of these was intended to have at least 2 or 3 hard surface runways, a dedicated railway connection, major built-up and heated repair and overhaul facilities, extensive indoor and outdoor storage spaces, and most had housing and facilities for 2000 to 3000 men. Each Fliegerhorst also had an auxiliary and often a decoy airfield, complete with mock-up planes made from plywood. The construction work was performed by Dutch contractors and Dutch workers on a totally voluntary basis.[citation needed] The largest became Deelen Air Base, north of Arnhem (12 former German buildings at Deelen are now national monuments). Adjacent to Deelen, the large central air control bunker for Belgium and the Netherlands, Diogenes, was set up.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin a year, the attack strategy had to be altered to a defensive operation. The ensuing air war over the Netherlands cost almost 20,000 airmen (Allied and German) their lives and 6,000 planes went down over the country - an average of 3 per day during the five years of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netherlands turned into the first line of western air defense for Germany and its industrial heartland of the Ruhrgebiet, complete with extensive flak, sound detection installations and later radar. The first German night-hunter squadron started its operations from the Netherlands.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome 30,000 Luftwaffe men and women were involved in the Netherlands throughout the war.[24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Arbeitseinsatz  the drafting of civilians for forced labour  was imposed on the Netherlands. This obliged every man between 18 and 45 to work in German factories, which were bombed regularly by the western Allies. Those who refused were forced into hiding. As food and many other goods were taken out of the Netherlands, rationing increased (with ration books). At times, the resistance would raid distribution centres to obtain ration cards to be distributed to those in hiding.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the resistance to succeed, it was sometimes necessary for its members to feign collaboration with the Germans. After the war, this led to difficulties for those who pretended to collaborate when they could not prove they had been in the resistance  something that was difficult because it was in the nature of the job to keep it a secret.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Atlantic Wall, a gigantic coastal defense line built by the Germans along the entire European coast from southwestern France to Denmark and Norway, included the coastline of the Netherlands. Some towns, such as Scheveningen, were evacuated because of this. In The Hague alone, 3,200 houses were demolished and 2,594 were dismantled. 20,000 houses were cleared, and 65,000 people were forced to move. The Arbeitseinsatz also included forcing the Dutch to work on these projects, but a form of passive resistance took place here with people working slowly or poorly.\\r\\n\\r\\nShortly after it was established, the military regime began to persecute the Jews of the Netherlands. In 1940, there were no deportations and only small measures were taken against the Jews. In February 1941, the Nazis deported a small group of Dutch Jews to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The Dutch reacted with the February strike, a nationwide protest against the deportations, unique in the history of Nazi-occupied Europe. Although the strike did not accomplish muchits leaders were executedit was an initial setback for Seyss-Inquart as he had planned to both deport the Jews and to win the Dutch over to the Nazi cause.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the February strike, the Nazis had installed a Jewish Council (Dutch: Joodse Raad). This was a board of Jews, headed by Professor David Cohen?(nl; de) and Abraham Asscher. Independent Jewish organizations such as the Committee for Jewish Refugees  founded by Asscher and Cohen in 1933  were closed.[26] The Jewish Council ultimately served as an instrument for organising the identification and deportation of Jews more efficiently; the Jews on the council were told and convinced they were helping the Jews. In May 1942, Jews were ordered to wear the Star of David badges. Around the same time the Catholic Church of the Netherlands publicly condemned the government's action in a letter read at all Sunday parish services. Thereafter, the Nazi government treated the Dutch more harshly: notable Socialists were imprisoned, and, later in the war, Catholic priests, including Titus Brandsma, were deported to concentration camps.[27]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1942, a transit camp (Durchgangslager) was established at Westerbork by converting the pre-war camp opened by the Committee for Jewish Refugees. Concentration camps were built at Vught and Amersfoort as well. Eventually, with the assistance of Dutch police and civil service, the majority of the Dutch Jews were deported to concentration camps.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nGermany was particularly effective in deporting and killing Jews during its occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. Of the 140,000 Jews in 1941, inclusive both of Dutch Jews and the refugees ensnared by the German invasion of 1940, about 38,000 survived at war's end in 1945. The survival rate of 27% is much lower than in neighboring Belgium, where 60% of Jews survived. It is also lower than in France, where 75% survived.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistorians have offered several hypotheses about why the survival rate was much smaller in the Netherlands than in the other western European countries; including the possibility that the German occupiers in the Netherlands were particularly vigorous in comparison to other occupied countries. The Netherlands included religion in its national records, which reduced the opportunity for Jews to mask their ethnic and religious identity. How much did the cooperation of the Dutch authorities and the Dutch people contribute? Did the absence of forests in the Netherlands deprive the Jews of hiding places? Marnix Croes and Peter Tammes have examined these hypotheses by looking at the variations in survival between the different regions of the Netherlands. They conclude that most of these hypotheses do not explain the data. They suggest that a more likely explanation was the varying \\"ferocity\\" with which the Germans and their Dutch collaborators hunted Jews in hiding in the different regions.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2018 publication, De 102.000 namen, lists the 102,000 known victims of the persecution of Jewish, Sinti, and Roma people from the Netherlands; the book is published by Boom, Amsterdam, under the auspices of the Westerbork Remembrance Center.[30]\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all Dutch offered active or passive resistance against the German occupation. Some Dutch men and women chose or were forced to collaborate with the German regime or joined the German army (which usually would mean being placed in the Waffen-SS). Others, like members of the Henneicke Column, were actively involved in capturing hiding Jews for a price and delivering them to the German occupiers. It is estimated that the Henneicke Column captured around 8,000-9,000 Dutch Jews who were ultimately sent to their death in the German death camps.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging (NSB) was the only legal political party in the Netherlands from 1941 and was actively involved in collaboration with the German occupiers. In 1941, when Germany still seemed certain to win the war, about three percent of the adult male population belonged to the NSB.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter World War II broke out, the NSB sympathized with the Germans, but nevertheless advocated strict neutrality for the Netherlands. In May 1940, after the German invasion, 10,000 NSB members and sympathizers were put in custody by the Dutch government. Soon after the Dutch defeat, on 14 May 1940, they were set free by German troops. In June 1940, NSB leader Anton Mussert held a speech in Lunteren in which he called for the Dutch to embrace the Germans and renounce the Dutch Monarchy, which had fled to London.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1940, the German regime had outlawed all socialist and communist parties; in 1941, it forbade all parties, except for the NSB. The NSB openly collaborated with the occupation forces. Its membership grew to about 100,000. The NSB played an important role in lower government and civil service; every new mayor appointed by the German occupation government was a member of the NSB.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the German signing of surrender on 6 May 1945, the NSB was outlawed. Mussert was arrested the following day. Many of the members of the NSB were arrested, but few were convicted; those who were included Mussert, who was executed on 7 May 1946. There were no attempts to continue the organization illegally.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 1940, the Nederlandsche SS was formed as \\"Afdeling XI\\" (Department XI) of the NSB. It was the equivalent to the Allgemeine SS in Germany. In November 1942 its name was changed in Germaansche SS in Nederland. The Nederlandsche SS was primarily a political formation but also served as manpower reservoir for the Waffen-SS.\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 20,000 and 25,000 Dutchmen volunteered to serve in the Heer and the Waffen-SS. The most notable formations were the 4th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Brigade Nederland which saw action exclusively on the Eastern Front and the SS Volunteer Grenadier Brigade Landstorm Nederland which fought in Belgium and the Netherlands.[31]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Nederland brigade participated in fighting on the Eastern Front during the Battle of Narva, with several soldiers receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, Nazi Germany's highest award for bravery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II developed relatively slowly, but its counter-intelligence, domestic sabotage, and communications networks provided key support to Allied forces beginning in 1944 and through the liberation of the country. Discovery by the Germans of involvement in the resistance meant an immediate death sentence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country's terrain, lack of wilderness and dense population made it difficult to conceal any illicit activities, and it was bordered by German-controlled territory, offering no escape route, except by sea. Resistance in the Netherlands took the form of small-scale, decentralized cells engaged in independent activities. The communist CPN, however, organized resistance from the start of the war. So did the circle of liberal democratic resisters who were linked through Professor Dr. Willem or Wim Schermerhorn to the Dutch government-in-exile in London, the LKP (\\"Nationale Knokploeg\\", or National Force Units, literal translation \\"Brawl Crew\\"). This was one of the largest resistance groups, numbering around 550 active participants; it was also heavily targeted by Nazi intelligence for destruction due to its links with England. Some small groups had absolutely no links to others. These groups produced forged ration cards and counterfeit money, collected intelligence, published underground newspapers, sabotaged phone lines and railways, prepared maps, and distributed food and goods. After 1942 the National Organisation (LO) and National Force Units (LKP) organized national coordination. Some contact was established with the government in London. After D-day the existing national organizations, the LKP, the OD and the Council of Resistance merged into the internal forces under the command of Prince Bernhard.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the riskiest activities was hiding and sheltering refugees and enemies of the Nazi regime, Jewish families like the family of Anne Frank, underground operatives, draft-age Dutch, and others. Collectively these people were known as onderduikers (literally 'under-divers'). Later in the war, this system of people-hiding was also used to protect downed Allied airmen. Reportedly, resistance doctors in Heerlen concealed an entire hospital floor from German troops.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1943, a Dutch resistance cell rang the doorbell of the former head of the Dutch general staff and now collaborating General-Lieutenant Hendrik Seyffardt in the Hague. Seyffardt commanded the campaign to recruit Dutch volunteers for the Waffen-SS and the German war effort on the Eastern Front. After he answered and identified himself, he was shot twice and died the following day. This assassination of the high-level official triggered a harsh reprisal from SS General Hanns Albin Rauter, who ordered the killing of 50 Dutch hostages and a series of raids on Dutch universities. On October 1 and 2, 1944, the Dutch resistance attacked German troops near the village of Putten, which resulted in war crimes on behalf of the occupying Germans. After the attack, part of the town was destroyed, and seven people were shot in the Putten raid. The entire male population of Putten was deported and most were subjected to forced labour; 48 out of 552 survived the camps. The Dutch resistance attacked Rauter's car on March 6, 1945, unaware of the identity of its occupant, which in turn led to the killings at Woeste Hoeve, where 116 men were rounded up and executed at the site of the ambush and another 147 Gestapo prisoners executed elsewhere.[34]\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days before the surrender, Queen Wilhelmina, her family, and the Dutch government left the country for the United Kingdom. Shortly after the German victory, the Dutch government, led by Prime Minister Dirk Jan de Geer, was invited by the Germans to return to the country and form a pro-German puppet government, as the Vichy government had agreed to do in France. De Geer wanted to accept this invitation but the Queen did not and dismissed De Geer in favour of Pieter Gerbrandy.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn December 8, 1941, the Netherlands declared war on the Japanese Empire.[35] On January 10, 1942 the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).\\r\\n\\r\\nDutch naval ships joined forces with the Allies to form the American-British-Dutch-Australian (ABDA) Fleet, commanded by Dutch rear admiral Karel Doorman. On February 27ÿ28, 1942, admiral Doorman was ordered to take the offensive against the Imperial Japanese Navy. His objections on the matter were overruled. The ABDA fleet finally encountered the Japanese surface fleet at the Battle of the Java Sea, at which Doorman gave the order to engage. During the ensuing battle the allied fleet suffered heavy losses. The Dutch cruisers Java and De Ruyter were lost, together with the destroyer Kortenaer. The other allied cruisers, the Australian Perth, the British Exeter, and the American Houston, tried to disengage but they were spotted by the Japanese in the following days and eventually all were destroyed. Numerous ABDA destroyers were also lost. According to legend, admiral Doorman's attack order was Ik val aan, volg mij! (\\"I am attacking, follow me!\\"); in reality, the order was \\"All ships follow me.\\"[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter Japanese troops had landed on Java and the KNIL had been unsuccessful in stopping their advance (due to the Japanese ability to occupy a relatively unguarded airstrip) the Dutch forces on Java surrendered on 1 March 1942. Some 42,000 Dutch soldiers were taken prisoner and interned in labor camps, though some were executed on the spot. Later all Dutch civilians (some 100,000 in total), were arrested and interned in camps, and some were deported to Japan or sent to work on the Thai-Burma Railway. During the Japanese occupation between 4 and 10 million Javanese were forced to work for the Japanese war effort. Some 270,000 Javanese were taken to other parts of Southeast Asia; only 52,000 of those survived.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Dutch government study described how the Japanese military recruited women as prostitutes by force in the Dutch East Indies.[36] It concluded that among the 200 to 300 European women working in Japanese military brothels, \\"some sixty five were most certainly forced into prostitution.\\"[37] Others, faced with starvation in the refugee camps, agreed to offers of food and payment for work, the nature of which was not completely revealed to them.[38][39][40][41][42]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch submarines escaped and resumed hostilities with the Allies from bases in Australia such as Fremantle. As a part of the Allied forces, they were on the hunt for Japanese tankers on their way to Japan and the movement of Japanese troops and weapons to other sites of battle (including New Guinea). Because of the significant number of Dutch submarines active in this theater of the war, the Dutch were named the \\"Fourth Ally\\" in the theatre  along with the Australians, Americans, and New Zealanders.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Dutch Army and Navy airmen escaped and, with airplanes provided by the U.S., formed the Royal Australian Air Force's Nos. 18 and 120 (Netherlands East Indies) Squadrons, equipped with B-25 Mitchell bombers and P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, respectively. No. 18 Squadron conducted bombing raids from Australia to the Dutch East Indies, and both squadrons eventually also participated in their recapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nGradually control of the Netherlands East Indies was wrested away from the Japanese. The largest Allied invasion of this theater took place in July 1945 with Australian landings on the island of Borneo, to seize the strategic oil-fields from the now cut-off Japanese forces. At that time the Japanese had already begun independence negotiations with Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno, and Indonesian forces had taken control of sizable portions of Sumatra and Java. Following the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945, Indonesian nationalists led by Sukarno declared their country's independence and a four year armed and diplomatic struggle between the Netherlands and Indonesian republicans began.\\r\\n\\r\\nDutch civilians, who suffered greatly during their internment, finally returned home to a land that had suffered greatly as well.[43]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Allied landing in Normandy in June 1944, the western Allies rapidly advanced in the direction of the Dutch border. Tuesday September 5 is known as Dolle dinsdag (\\"mad Tuesday\\")  the Dutch began celebrating, believing they were close to liberation. In September, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden, an attempt to advance from the Dutch-Belgian border across the rivers Meuse, Waal and Rhine into the north of the Netherlands and Germany. However, the Allied forces did not reach this objective because they could not capture the Rhine bridge at the Battle of Arnhem. During Market Garden, substantial regions to the south, including Nijmegen, Eindhoven and much of North Brabant, were liberated. Much of the northern Netherlands remained in German hands until the Rhine crossings in late March 1945.\\r\\n\\r\\nParts of the southern Netherlands were not liberated by Operation Market Garden, which had established a narrow salient between Eindhoven and Nijmegen. In the east of North Brabant and in Limburg, British and American forces in Operation Aintree managed to defeat the remaining German forces west of the Meuse between late September and early December 1944, destroying the German bridgehead between the Meuse and the Peel marshes. During this offensive the only tank battle ever fought on Dutch soil took place at Overloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same time, the Allies also advanced into the province of Zeeland. At the start of October 1944, the Germans still occupied Walcheren and dominated the Scheldt estuary and its approaches to the port of Antwerp. The crushing need for a large supply port forced the Battle of the Scheldt in which First Canadian Army fought on both sides of the estuary during the month to clear the waterways. Large battles were fought to clear the Breskens Pocket, Woensdrecht and the Zuid-Beveland Peninsula of German forces, primarily \\"stomach\\" units of the Wehrmacht as well as German paratroopers of Battle Group Chill. German units composed of convalescents and the medically unfit were named for their ailment; thus, \\"stomach\\" units for soldiers with ulcers.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 31 October, resistance south of the Scheldt had collapsed, and the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, British 52nd (Lowland) Division and 4th Special Service Brigade all made attacks on Walcheren Island. Strong German defenses made a landing very difficult, and the Allies responded by bombing the dikes of Walcheren at Westkapelle, Vlissingen and Veere to flood the island. Though the Allies had warned residents with pamphlets, 180 inhabitants of Westkappelle died. The coastal guns on Walcheren were silenced in the opening days of November and the Scheldt battle declared over; no German forces remained intact along the 64?mi (103?km) path to Antwerp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the Allied armies broke out from Normandy, the Polish 1st Armoured Division pursued the Germans along the coast of the English Channel. It liberated, among others, the towns of Ypres, Ghent and Passchendaele. A successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by General Maczek allowed liberation of the city of Breda without any civilian casualties (October 29, 1944).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch government had not wanted to use the old water line when the Germans had invaded in 1940. It was still possible to create an island out of the Holland region by destroying dikes and flooding the polders, but this island contained the main cities. The Dutch government had decided then that there were too many people to keep alive to justify the flooding. However, Hitler ordered that Fortress Holland (German: Festung Holland) be held at any price.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe winter of 1944ÿ1945 was very harsh, which led to 'hunger journeys' and many cases of starvation (about 30,000 casualties), exhaustion, cold and disease. This winter is known as the Hongerwinter (literally, \\"hunger winter\\") or the Dutch famine of 1944. In response to a general railway strike ordered by the Dutch government-in-exile in expectation of a general German collapse near the end of 1944, the Germans cut off all food and fuel shipments to the western provinces in which 4.5 million people lived. Severe malnutrition was common and 18,000 people starved to death. Relief came at the beginning of May 1945.[45]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter crossing the Rhine at Wesel and Rees, Canadian forces entered the Netherlands from the east, liberating the eastern and northern provinces. The western provinces, where the situation was worst, however, had to wait until the surrender of German forces in the Netherlands was negotiated on the eve of May 5, 1945 (three days before the general capitulation of Germany), in the Hotel de Wereld in Wageningen. Previously the Swedish Red Cross had been allowed to provide relief efforts, and Allied forces were allowed to airdrop food over the German-occupied territories in Operation Manna.[46]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the island of Texel, nearly 800 men of the Georgian Legion, serving in the German army as Osttruppen, rebelled on April 5, 1945. Their rebellion was crushed by the German army after two weeks of battle. 565 Georgians, 120 inhabitants of Texel, and 800 Germans died. The 228 surviving Georgians were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union when the war ended.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being liberated, Dutch citizens began taking the law into their own hands, as had been done in other liberated countries, such as France. Collaborators and Dutch women who had had relationships with men of the German occupying force, called \\"Moffenmeiden\\" were abused and humiliated in public, usually by having their heads shaved and painted orange.[citation needed]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of the war, 205,901 Dutch men and women had died of war-related causes. The Netherlands had the highest per capita death rate of all Nazi-occupied countries in Western Europe (2.36%).[47]  Over half (107,000) were Holocaust victims, deported and murdered Jews. There were also many thousands of non-Dutch Jews in the total, who had fled to the Netherlands from other countries, seeking safety, the most famous being Anne Frank. Another 30,000 died in the Dutch East Indies, either while fighting the Japanese or in camps as Japanese POWs. Dutch civilians were also held in these camps.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, some accused of collaborating with the Germans were lynched or otherwise punished without trial. Men who had fought with the Germans in the Wehrmacht or Waffen-SS were used to clear minefields and suffered losses accordingly. Others were sentenced by courts for treason. Some were proven to have been wrongly arrested and were cleared of charges, sometimes after being held in custody for a long period of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Dutch government initially developed plans to annex a sizeable portion of Germany (Bakker-Schut Plan), either with or without its German population  which in the latter case would have to be \\"Dutchified\\"  doubling the land area of the Netherlands. This plan was dropped after an Allied refusal (although two small villages were added to the Netherlands in 1949 and returned in 1963). One successfully-implemented plan was Black Tulip, the deportation of all holders of German passports from the Netherlands, resulting in several thousand German deportations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bank balances of Dutch Jews who were killed are still the subject of legal proceedings, more than 70 years after the end of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe end of the war also meant the final loss of the Dutch East Indies. Following the surrender of the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies, Indonesian nationalists fought a four-year war of independence against Dutch and initially British Commonwealth forces, eventually leading to the Dutch recognition of the independence of Indonesia. Many Dutch and Indonesians emigrated or returned to the Netherlands at this time, and their presence has resulted in a lasting Indonesian influence in Dutch culture and cuisine.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld War II left many lasting effects on Dutch society. On May 4, the Dutch commemorate those who died during the war. Among the living, there are many who still bear the emotional scars of the war, both first and second generation. In 2000, the government was still granting 24,000 people an annual compensatory payment (although this also includes victims from later wars, such as the Korean War).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, the Dutch Red Cross offered its deep apologies for its failure to act to protect Jews, Sinti and Roma, and political prisoners during the war, following the publication of a study that it had commissioned from the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies.

It depicts the goddess Venus arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called Venus Anadyomene and often depicted in art). The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.\\r\\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the Primavera, also in the Uffizi. They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the Italian Renaissance; of the two, the Birth is even better known than the Primavera.[1] As depictions of subjects from classical mythology on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the Birth. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain.\\r\\nThey have been endlessly analysed by art historians, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of Renaissance Neo-Platonism (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed). Most art historians agree, however, that the Birth does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the Primavera probably does. While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from Greek mythology, and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.[2]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the centre the newly-born goddess Venus stands nude in a giant scallop shell. Its size is purely imaginary, and is also found in classical depictions of the subject.[3] At the left the wind god Zephyr blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth. He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings. Vasari was probably correct in identifying her as \\"Aura\\", personification of a lighter breeze.[4] Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.[5]\\r\\nAt the right a female figure who may be floating slightly above the ground holds out a rich cloak or dress to cover Venus when she reaches the shore, as she is about to do. She is one of the three Horae or Hours, Greek minor goddesses of the seasons and of other divisions of time, and attendants of Venus. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring.[6]\\r\\nAlternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the Primavera; the nymph held by Zephyr may be Chloris, a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story, and the figure on land may be Flora.[7] Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris; in the Primavera Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her, following Ovid's Fasti,[8] but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here. However, the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris.\\r\\nThe subject is not strictly the \\"Birth of Venus\\", a title only given the painting in the nineteenth century (though given as the subject by Vasari), but the next scene in her story, where she arrives on land, blown by the wind. The land probably represents either Cythera or Cyprus, both Mediterranean islands regarded by the Greeks as territories of Venus.[9]\\r\\nThe painting is large, but slightly smaller than the Primavera, and where that is a panel painting, this is on the cheaper support of canvas. Canvas was increasing in popularity, perhaps especially for secular paintings for country villas, which were decorated more simply, cheaply and cheerfully than those for city palazzi, being designed for pleasure more than ostentatious entertainment.[10]\\r\\nThe painting is on two pieces of canvas, sewn together before starting, with a gesso ground tinted blue. There are differences to Botticelli's usual technique, working on panel supports, such as the lack of a green first layer under the flesh areas. There are a number of pentimenti revealed by modern scientific testing. The Hora originally had \\"low classical sandals\\", and the collar on the mantle she holds out is an afterthought. The hair of Venus and the flying couple was changed. There is heavy use of gold as a pigment for highlights, on hair, wings, textiles, the shell and the landscape. This was all apparently applied after the painting was framed. It was finished with a \\"cool gray varnish\\", probably using egg yolk.[11]\\r\\nAs in the Primavera, the green pigment used for the wings of Zephyr and his companion and the leaves of the orange trees on the land has darkened considerably with exposure to light over time, somewhat distorting the intended balance of colours. Parts of some leaves at the top right corner, normally covered by the frame, have been less affected.[12] The blues of the sea and sky have also lost their brightness.[13]\\r\\nAlthough the pose of Venus is classical in some respects, and borrows the position of the hands from the Venus Pudica type in Greco-Roman sculptures (see section below), the overall treatment of the figure, standing off-centre with a curved body of long flowing lines, is in many respects from Gothic art. Kenneth Clark wrote: \\"Her differences from antique form are not physiological, but rhythmic and structural. Her whole body follows the curve of a Gothic ivory. It is entirely without that quality so much prized in classical art, known as aplomb; that is to say, the weight of the body is not distributed evenly either side of a central plumb line. .... She is not standing but floating. ... Her shoulders, for example, instead of forming a sort of architrave to her torso, as in the antique nude, run down into her arms in the same unbroken stream of movement as her floating hair.\\"[14]\\r\\nVenus' body is anatomically improbable, with elongated neck and torso. Her pose is impossible: although she stands in a classical contrapposto stance, her weight is shifted too far over the left leg for the pose to be held. The proportions and poses of the winds to the left do not quite make sense, and none of the figures cast shadows.[15] The painting depicts the world of the imagination rather than being very concerned with realistic depiction.[16]\\r\\nIgnoring the size and positioning of the wings and limbs of the flying pair on the left, which bother some other critics, Kenneth Clark calls them:\\r\\n...perhaps the most beautiful example of ecstatic movement in the whole of painting. ... the suspension of our reason is achieved by the intricate rhythms of the drapery which sweep and flow irresistibly around the nude figures. Their bodies, by an endless intricacy of embrace, sustain the current of movement, which finally flickers down their legs and is dispersed like an electric charge.[17]\\r\\nBotticelli's art was never fully committed to naturalism; in comparison to his contemporary Domenico Ghirlandaio, Botticelli seldom gave weight and volume to his figures and rarely used a deep perspectival space.[15] Botticelli never painted landscape backgrounds with great detail or realism, but this is especially the case here. The laurel trees and the grass below them are green with gold highlights, most of the waves regular patterns, and the landscape seems out of scale with the figures.[18] The clumps of bulrushes in the left foreground are out of place here, as they come from a freshwater species.[19]\\r\\nIt has long been suggested that Botticelli was commissioned to paint the work by the Medici family of Florence, perhaps by Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici (1463ÿ1503) a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, \\"il Magnifico\\". This was first suggested by Herbert Horne in his monograph of 1908, the first major modern work on Botticelli, and long followed by most writers, but more recently has been widely doubted, though it is still accepted by some. Various interpretations of the painting rely on this origin for its meaning. Although relations were perhaps always rather tense between the Magnifico and his young cousins and wards, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, it may have been politic to commission a work that glorified the older Lorenzo, as some interpretations have it. There may be a deliberate ambiguity as to which Lorenzo was intended to be evoked. In later years hostility between the two branches of the family became overt.\\r\\nHorne believed that the painting was commissioned soon after the purchase in 1477 of the Villa di Castello, a country house outside Florence, by Lorenzo and Giovanni, to decorate their new house, which they were rebuilding. This was the year after their father died at the age of 46, leaving the young boys wards of their cousin Lorenzo il Magnifico, of the senior branch of the Medici family and de facto ruler of Florence.[20] There is no record of the original commission, and the painting is first mentioned by Vasari, who saw it, together with the Primavera, at Castello, some time before the first edition of his Lives in 1550, probably by 1530ÿ40. In 1550 Vasari was himself painting in the villa, but he very possibly visited it before that. But in 1975 it emerged that, unlike the Primavera, the Birth is not in the inventory, apparently complete, made in 1499 of the works of art belonging to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's branch of the family. Ronald Lightbown concludes that it only came to be owned by the Medici after that. The inventory was only published in 1975, and made many previous assumptions invalid.[21]\\r\\nHorne dated the work at some point after the purchase of the villa in 1477 and before Botticelli's departure for Rome to join the painting of the Sistine Chapel in 1481. Recent scholars prefer a date of around 1484ÿ86 on grounds of the work's place in the development of Botticelli's style. The Primavera is now usually dated earlier, after Botticelli's return from Rome in 1482 and perhaps around the time of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's wedding in July 1482,[22] but by some still before Botticelli's departure.[23]\\r\\nWhenever the two paintings were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi. For some years until 1919 they were kept in the Galleria dell'Accademia, another government museum in Florence.[24]\\r\\nAlthough there are ancient and modern texts that are relevant, no single text provides the precise imagery of the painting, which has led scholars to propose many sources and interpretations.[25] Many art historians who specialize in the Italian Renaissance have found Neoplatonic interpretations, of which two different versions have been articulated by Edgar Wind and Ernst Gombrich,[26] to be the key to understanding the painting. Botticelli represented the Neoplatonic idea of divine love in the form of a nude Venus.[27]\\r\\nFor Plato ÿ and so for the members of the Florentine Platonic Academy ÿ Venus had two aspects: she was an earthly goddess who aroused humans to physical love or she was a heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love in them. Plato further argued that contemplation of physical beauty allowed the mind to better understand spiritual beauty. So, looking at Venus, the most beautiful of goddesses, might at first raise a physical response in viewers which then lifted their minds towards the godly.[28] A Neoplatonic reading of Botticelli's Birth of Venus suggests that 15th-century viewers would have looked at the painting and felt their minds lifted to the realm of divine love.\\r\\nThe composition, with a central nude figure, and one to the side with an arm raised above the head of the first, and winged beings in attendance, would have reminded its Renaissance viewers of the traditional iconography of the Baptism of Christ, marking the start of his ministry on earth. In a similar way, the scene shows here marks the start of Venus's ministry of love, whether in a simple sense, or the expanded meaning of Renaissance Neoplatonism.[29]\\r\\nMore recently, questions have arisen about Neoplatonism as the dominant intellectual system of late 15th-century Florence,[30] and scholars have indicated that there might be other ways to interpret Botticelli's mythological paintings. In particular, both Primavera and Birth of Venus have been seen as wedding paintings that suggest appropriate behaviors for brides and grooms.[31]\\r\\nThe laurel trees at right and laurel wreath worn by the Hora are punning references to the name \\"Lorenzo\\", though it is uncertain whether Lorenzo il Magnifico, the effective ruler of Florence, or his young cousin Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco is meant. In the same way the flowers in the air around Zephyr and on the textiles worn and carried by the Hora evoke the name of Florence.[32]\\r\\nThe closest precedent for the scene is generally agreed to be in one of the early ancient Greek Homeric Hymns, published in Florence in 1488 by the Greek refugee Demetrios Chalkokondyles:\\r\\nThis poem was probably already known to Botticelli's Florentine contemporary, and Lorenzo di Medici's court poet, Angelo Poliziano. The iconography of The Birth of Venus is similar to a description of a relief of the event in Poliziano's poem the Stanze per la giostra, commemorating a Medici joust in 1475, which may also have influenced Botticelli, although there are many differences. For example Poliziano talks of multiple Horae and zephyrs.[34] Older writers, following Horne, posited that \\"his patron Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco asked him to paint a subject illustrating the lines\\",[35] and that remains a possibility, though one difficult to maintain so confidently today. Another poem by Politian speaks of Zephyr causing flowers to bloom, and spreading their scent over the land, which probably explains the roses he blows along with him in the painting.[36]\\r\\nHaving a large standing female nude as the central focus was unprecedented in post-classical Western painting, and certainly drew on the classical sculptures which were coming to light in this period, especially in Rome, where Botticelli had spent 1481ÿ82 working on the walls of the Sistine Chapel.[37] The pose of Botticelli's Venus follows the Venus Pudica (\\"Venus of Modesty\\") type from classical antiquity, where the hands are held to cover the breasts and groin; in classical art this is not associated with the new-born Venus Anadyomene. What became a famous example of this type is the Venus de' Medici, a marble sculpture that was in a Medici collection in Rome by 1559, which Botticelli may have had opportunity to study (the date it was found is unclear).[38]\\r\\nThe painter and the humanist scholars who probably advised him would have recalled that Pliny the Elder had mentioned a lost masterpiece of the celebrated ancient Greek painter, Apelles, representing Venus Anadyomene (Venus Rising from the Sea). According to Pliny, Alexander the Great offered his mistress, Pankaspe, as the model for the nude Venus and later, realizing that Apelles had fallen in love with the girl, gave her to the artist in a gesture of extreme magnanimity. Pliny went on to note that Apelles' painting of Pankaspe as Venus was later \\"dedicated by Augustus in the shrine of his father Caesar.\\" Pliny also stated that \\"the lower part of the painting was damaged, and it was impossible to find anyone who could restore it. . . . This picture decayed from age and rottenness, and Nero... substituted for it another painting by the hand of Dorotheus\\".\\r\\nPliny also noted a second painting by Apelles of Venus \\"superior even to his earlier one,\\" that had been begun by artist but left unfinished. The Roman images in various media showing the new-born Venus in a giant shell may well be crude derivative versions of these paintings. Botticelli could not have seen the frescos unearthed later in Pompeii, but may well have seen small versions of the motif in terracotta or engraved gems. The \\"House of Venus\\" in Pompeii has a life-size fresco of Venus lying in the shell, also seen in other works; in most other images she stands with her hands on her hair, wringing the water from it, with or without a shell.\\r\\nThe two-dimensionality of this painting may be a deliberate attempt to evoke the style of ancient Greek vase painting or frescos on the walls of Etruscan tombs,[39] the only types of ancient painting known to Botticelli.\\r\\nGreco-Roman Venus Anadyomene\\r\\nGreco-Roman bronze statuette\\r\\nRoman glass cameo Venus Anadyomene\\r\\nGreek terracotta, from Pontus\\r\\nAnother interpretation of the Birth of Venus is provided here by its author, Charles R. Mack. This interpretation takes much that is generally agreed, but Mack goes on to explain the painting as an allegory extolling the virtues of Lorenzo de' Medici.[40] This has not been adopted by Renaissance art historians in general,[41] and it remains problematic, since it depends on the painting being commissioned by the Medici, yet the work is not documented in Medici hands until well into the following century.\\r\\nMack sees the scene as inspired by both the Homeric Hymn and the ancient paintings. But something more than a rediscovered Homeric hymn was likely in the mind of the Medici family member who commissioned this painting from Botticelli. Once again, Botticelli, in his version of the Birth of Venus, might be seen as completing the task begun by his ancient predecessor Apelles, even surpassing him. Giving added support to this interpretation of Botticelli as a born-again Apelles is the fact that that very claim was voiced in 1488 by Ugolino Verino in a poem entitled \\"On Giving Praise to the History of Florence.\\"[42]\\r\\nWhile Botticelli might well have been celebrated as a revivified Apelles, his Birth of Venus also testified to the special nature of Florence's chief citizen, Lorenzo de' Medici. Although it now seems that the painting was executed for another member of the Medici family, it likely was intended to celebrate and flatter its head, Lorenzo de' Medici. Tradition associates the image of Venus in Botticelli's painting with the famous beauty Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci, of whom popular legend claims both Lorenzo and his younger brother, Giuliano, were great admirers. Simonetta was possibly born in the Ligurian seaside town of Portovenere ('the port of Venus'). Thus, in Botticelli's interpretation, Pankaspe (the ancient living prototype of Simonetta), the mistress of Alexander the Great (the Laurentian predecessor), becomes the lovely model for the lost Venus executed by the famous Greek painter Apelles (reborn through the recreative talents of Botticelli), which ended up in Rome, installed by Emperor Augustus in the temple dedicated to Florence's supposed founder Julius Caesar.\\r\\nIn the case of Botticelli's Birth of Venus, the suggested references to Lorenzo, supported by other internal indicators such as the stand of laurel bushes at the right, would have been just the sort of thing erudite Florentine humanists would have appreciated. Accordingly, by overt implication, Lorenzo becomes the new Alexander the Great with an implied link to both Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and even to Florence's legendary founder, Caesar himself. Lorenzo, furthermore, is not only magnificent but, as was Alexander in Pliny's story, also magnanimous, as well. Ultimately, these readings of the Birth of Venus flatter not only the Medici and Botticelli but all of Florence, home to the worthy successors to some of the greatest figures of antiquity, both in governance and in the arts.[43]\\r\\nThese essentially pagan readings of Botticelli's Birth of Venus should not exclude a more purely Christian one, which may be derived from the Neoplatonic reading of the painting indicated above. Viewed from a religious standpoint, the nudity of Venus suggests that of Eve before the Fall as well as the pure love of Paradise. Once landed, the goddess of love will don the earthly garb of mortal sin, an act that will lead to the New Eve ÿ the Madonna whose purity is represented by the nude Venus. Once draped in earthly garments she becomes a personification of the Christian Church which offers a spiritual transport back to the pure love of eternal salvation. In this case the scallop shell upon which this image of Venus/Eve/Madonna/Church stands may be seen in its traditionally symbolic pilgrimage context. Furthermore, the broad expanse of sea serves as a reminder of the Virgin Mary's title stella maris, alluding both to the Madonna's name (Maria/maris) and to the heavenly body (Venus/stella). The sea brings forth Venus just as the Virgin gives birth to the ultimate symbol of love, Christ.[44]\\r\\nRather than choosing one of the many interpretations offered for Botticelli's depiction of the Birth (Arrival?) of Venus it might be better to view it from a variety of perspectives. This layered approachmythological, political, religiouswas intended.[45]\\r\\nBotticelli, or more likely his workshop, repeated the figure of Venus in another painting of about 1490. This life-sized work depicts a similar figure and pose, partially clad in a light blouse, and contrasted against a plain dark background. It is in the Galleria Sabauda in Turin.[46][47] There is another such workshop Venus in Berlin, and very likely others were destroyed in the \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\". Examples seem to have been exported to France and Germany, probably influencing Lucas Cranach the Elder among others.[48]\\r\\nMore than a decade later, Botticelli adapted the figure of Venus for a nude personification of \\"Truth\\" in his Calumny of Apelles. Here one hand is raised, pointing to heaven for justification, and the figure's gaze also looks upwards; the whole effect is very different.[49]","input":"What kind of art is the birth of venus?"},{"output":"John Robertson","context":"Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club is a professional football club based in Inverness, Scotland. The team currently competes in the Scottish Championship.\\r\\nCaledonian Thistle F.C. were formed in August 1994 by the merger of Caledonian and Inverness Thistle, both members of the Highland Football League. The new club was formed with a view to applying for one of the two vacancies in the Scottish Football League, created when the league restructured in 1994 to four divisions of ten teams each. They were successful and were elected to the Scottish Third Division along with Highland derby rivals Ross County. The club's name was amended to Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. in 1996 at the request of Inverness District Council.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe club first came to national prominence after their Scottish Cup victories over Celtic in 2000 and 2003: winning 3ÿ1 at Celtic Park,[4] resulting in the headline \\"Super Caley Go Ballistic Celtic Are Atrocious\\" in The Sun which is now framed in the foyer of Caledonian Stadium,[5] and 1ÿ0.[6] Inverness also knocked other SPL teams out of cup competitions, including Motherwell[7] and Hearts.[8] Over the first ten years of their existence the club had been responsible for a total of 12 'shocks' and as a result had gained themselves a reputation as being \\"giant killers\\". On 25 February 2007, Inverness's run of cup victories over Celtic came to an end following two goals in the last two minutes of their fifth round tie at Caledonian Stadium. Having led 1ÿ0 for the majority of the game thanks to a Graham Bayne goal, Steven Pressley equalised before Kenny Miller netted the winner in stoppage time.[9] However, another victory against Celtic occurred on 16 December 2007, this time in the league, when the team came from being 2ÿ0 down to win 3ÿ2, with goals scored by John Rankin, David Proctor and Don Cowie.\\r\\nA significant event in the club's history was the signing of Romanian international Marius Niculae.[10] Niculae was involved in the club's 2007ÿ08 campaign and played at UEFA Euro 2008, before leaving for Dinamo Bucure?ti. He later became involved in a dispute with the club over a share of the transfer fee that was not paid to him when he left. As a result, Inverness were ordered by FIFA to pay S133,000 to the player.[11] The club appealed against the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,[12] and in November 2011, the club won their appeal.[13]\\r\\nHaving won the 2009ÿ10 First Division title in their first year back in the division since 2003ÿ04, Inverness competed in the top tier of Scottish football for the next 7 years. Season 2014ÿ15 saw the club finish in their best ever placing of third.\\r\\nAfter a promising start to their inaugural campaign in 1994ÿ95, the club eventually finished sixth in the Third Division. The following season, Inverness CT showed improvement with a third-place finish. In Season 1996ÿ97, they won the Third Division Championship following a 4ÿ1 home win over Albion Rovers in front of nearly 3,000 fans. This was just 5 months after moving into the Caledonian Stadium.\\r\\nThe club spent two seasons in the Second Division. After a closely fought campaign, they finished runners-up to Livingston in Season 1998ÿ99, thereby securing promotion to the First Division.\\r\\nSeason 2003ÿ2004 could be regarded as the club's most successful up to that point. In November 2003, they defeated Airdrie United 2ÿ0, with goals from Steve Hislop and David Bingham, to win the Scottish Challenge Cup, and also reached the Scottish Cup semi-final, losing a replay 3ÿ2 to Dunfermline Athletic after a 1ÿ1 draw at Hampden Park. However, the greatest achievement was on the final day of the season, when Inverness defeated St Johnstone 3ÿ1, with goals from Paul Ritchie, David Bingham and Barry Wilson and, as a result, pipped Clyde to the First Division title. This made the club eligible for promotion to the Scottish Premier League (SPL). However, SPL rules at that time stated that all member clubs must have a stadium with a minimum capacity of 10,000 seats. Caledonian Stadium did not meet this criterion, leaving the club's Board with a dilemma: either to remain in the First Division (like Falkirk the previous season) or to groundshare with Aberdeen, over 100 miles (160?km) away. After consulting with supporters, the Board decided the 'sacrifice' of one season in Aberdeen would be an acceptable compromise to ensure Premier League participation for the club.\\r\\nA change in SPL rules during the 2004ÿ05 season reduced the stadium seating requirement to 6,000 seats for SPL membership. The Caledonian Stadium was rendered a valid SPL venue after a rapid ground expansion, with two new stands added. The stadium was renamed as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium in honour of the local building firm that completed the work in only 47 working days. The chairman of Tulloch, David Sutherland, was also chairman of the club at the time and remains a major shareholder.[14] The club returned to playing in Inverness, defeating Dunfermline 2ÿ0 in their first SPL game in their own ground on 29 January 2005, thanks to goals from Barry Wilson and then player-manager Craig Brewster.[15]\\r\\nDuring season 2008ÿ09 season, the team incurred a number of bad results and struggled near the bottom of the SPL. Eventually, manager Craig Brewster was sacked after a run of seven consecutive defeats, ending with a 1ÿ0 loss to Hamilton Academical.[16] This was the first time the club had sacked a manager, and the fans had previously voiced concern about Brewster's ability.[17] Brewster was replaced by former England international Terry Butcher, who was unable to prevent the club's relegation, despite an initial improvement in results. Inverness Caledonian Thistle's tenure in the SPL eventually ended in May 2009 after suffering a 1ÿ0 home defeat to Falkirk.[18] Their final total of 37 points remains the highest ever for a team finishing bottom of the SPL.\\r\\nAfter a slow start to their first season back in the First Division, which looked set to be won at a canter by runaway leaders Dundee who were 15 points ahead in January, Inverness put together an astonishing run of form which saw them go on a 21-match unbeaten run. On 21 April 2010, Inverness secured promotion back to the SPL with two games to spare after Dundee lost to Raith Rovers. Inverness became the first team in ten years to secure an immediate return to the SPL. The team went on to celebrate their promotion with a 7ÿ0 win at Ayr United, their biggest ever away win. On the final day of the season, Inverness beat Dundee 1ÿ0.\\r\\nHaving won the 2009ÿ10 First Division title in their first year back in the division since 2003ÿ04, Inverness have since competed in the top tier of Scottish football. In 2013ÿ14, the club reached their first major final ÿ the Scottish League Cup ÿ losing on penalties to Aberdeen. They then beat Falkirk in the final of the Scottish Cup in 2015. That same season, Inverness secured entry to European competition for the first time, with a best-ever third-place finish in the Premiership.[19]\\r\\nAs part of the push for promotion in the 2009ÿ10 season, Inverness went on an unbeaten away run in the league that continued through the entire 2010 calendar year, culminating in a 1ÿ1 draw against Hearts at Tynecastle on 18 December.[20] This extraordinary sequence ended in defeat at St Johnstone on 2 January 2011 when the Perth side won by a single goal. At the split, Inverness narrowly missed out on a top six spot, eventually finishing in a club record-equalling 7th place. However, two years later, they would finish even higher.\\r\\nDuring the 2012ÿ13 season, a 3ÿ0 win over Hibernian on 8 December 2012 saw them rise to second place in the SPL (behind Celtic), their then, highest ever league position.\\r\\nContinued good form over the course of the season consolidated the club's position in the top-half of the table. Victory over Highland derby rivals Ross County[21] on 16 March elevated Inverness CT onto an almost unassailable points-total in their quest for a maiden 'top-6' finish. This achievement was confirmed the following day as the club benefited from a favourable result in the Sunday SPL fixture.[22] This guarantee of a 'top-6' place ensured that the 2012ÿ13 Scottish Premier League season would see Inverness CT record, their then, highest ever finishing league position.\\r\\nUltimately, Inverness CT finished in 4th place, narrowly missing Europa League qualification on the final day of the season, succumbing to a 1ÿ0 defeat from local rivals Ross County.[23]\\r\\nInverness CT began the inaugural season (2013ÿ14 Scottish Premiership) of the revamped SPFL Scottish Premiership with a 3ÿ0 win over St Mirren. This result saw the club take pole-position in the league table. They remained top of the league until the 9th game of the season when they dropped to 2nd place following a loss at St Johnstone.\\r\\nOn 11 November 2013, Hibernian reached a compensation deal with Inverness for Terry Butcher to move to the club, alongside assistant manager Maurice Malpas.[24]\\r\\nAfter an extensive recruitment process, on 4 December 2013, John Hughes was unveiled as the new manager of the club.[25] In January 2014, Russell Latapy was appointed as Hughes' assistant manager.[26]\\r\\nIn February 2014, Inverness defeated Hearts in the Scottish League Cup semi-final. Inverness struck first with Greg Tansey firing the Highland side into the lead. Jamie Hamill then scored 2 goals in 2 minutes and gave Hearts hope of reaching their second League Cup Final in two years. Just when Inverness were on the brink of defeat, Nick Ross equalised in the 94th minute and sent the game to extra time. After no goals being scored in extra time, Inverness clinched the win on penalties.\\r\\nOn 25 February, Inverness beat Ross County in Dingwall in the Highland Derby. The 3ÿ0 win was the first time they had won a Highland Derby in Dingwall in the League since March 2003. They also won the next derby 2ÿ1 on 4 April. The game was also played in Dingwall.\\r\\nOn 16 March, Inverness and Aberdeen faced each other in the 2014 Scottish League Cup Final at Celtic Park in Glasgow. After tense 120 minutes the two teams lined up for a penalty shoot-out. Inverness missed their first 2 penalties with Billy McKay's penalty saved and Greg Tansey firing over the bar. Despite Nick Ross and Aaron Doran scoring their penalties Aberdeen won 4ÿ2.\\r\\nInverness finished the season with a 2ÿ0 win over St Johnstone thanks to second half goals from Ryan Christie and Greg Tansey.\\r\\nIn May 2014, the club announced the American fast food restaurant franchise Subway as their new main shirt sponsor.\\r\\nBetween May and September 2014, Inverness kept a series of consecutive clean sheets, enabling them to achieve a club record of 616 minutes without conceding a goal.\\r\\nFurther success followed that season, with a 1ÿ0 victory away to Dundee confirming a record third-place league finish for the club. This also guaranteed Inverness qualifying for European football for the first time ÿ they competed in the 2015ÿ16 UEFA Europa League.[19]\\r\\nInverness CT capped an extraordinary 2014ÿ15 season by winning the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk at Hampden Park.[27] This result came after they defeated Celtic in a tense semi-final.[28]\\r\\nThis was the club's first major national trophy, and the first major national trophy won by any club from the Highlands in Scottish football history. [29]\\r\\nInverness CT were relegated to the Scottish Championship on the final day of the 2016ÿ17 season, despite recording a 3ÿ2 victory over Motherwell.[30] After Richie Foran resigned from his position, former manager John Robertson was appointed as his successor on 14 June 2017.[31]\\r\\nIn 2017 Inverness cut ties with Carbrini due to delays in manufacturing of replica kits, which angered many fans who had ordered their kits and took months to arrive at their homes, the kits were only available at JD Sports Stores and did not become available to buy until a month into the 2016ÿ17 season. Compared to previous seasons with Errea, when the kits were readily available at the Club Shop. Inverness partnered up with longtime supplier Errea in May 2017 in time for the 2017ÿ18 season.[33]\\r\\nThe Highland Council contributed S900,000 towards the development of Caledonian Stadium, now known for sponsorship reasons as the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium. The stadium is situated beside the Moray Firth, in the shadow of the Kessock Bridge. Its construction was promised in their election[clarification needed] to the Scottish Football League.[citation needed] The former ground of Caledonian, Telford Street, was used until the new stadium was complete.\\r\\nThe club's highest 'home' (league) attendance actually occurred while they were groundsharing with Aberdeen at Pittodrie. With Inverness fans in the traditional home end, and Aberdeen fans filling the away end, a record attendance of 9,530 was set on 16 October 2004. This record may stand for some time, as the crowd that day was bigger than the current capacity of Caledonian Stadium.\\r\\nThe club's highest 'home' (cup) attendance was also recorded in a venue other than their home ground. A crowd of 11,296 watched Inverness play Rangers on 9 March 1996 at Tannadice in Dundee. The game had been switched to Dundee as the club's home ground (Telford Street Park at that time) was deemed unsuitable for the Scottish Cup quarter-final tie.\\r\\nThe highest attendance recorded at the Caledonian Stadium is 7,753 set on 20 January 2008 against Rangers.\\r\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

He remained in charge for only one season, leaving in 1995 to be closer to his family in Perth.\\r\\nBaltacha was replaced by Huntly manager Steve Paterson, who to date is the club's longest-serving manager. During his seven and a half years as manager, from the summer of 1995 to December 2002, Paterson succeeded in taking the club to the Scottish Football League First Division. He also steered ICT to their famous 3ÿ1 Scottish Cup victory against Celtic in 2000.\\r\\nIn November 2002 Paterson was strongly linked to the vacant manager's position at Dundee United. However, he chose to stay with Inverness for another month, after which he left, along with assistant Duncan Shearer, to become manager of Aberdeen.\\r\\nThe club also had a Director of football, with former player Graeme Bennett appointed while Steve Paterson was manager.[39]\\r\\nPaterson was replaced by former Hearts player John Robertson, whose two-year reign as manager was an exceptionally successful period. Under Robertson, Inverness won the 2003ÿ04 Scottish Challenge Cup, gained another Scottish Cup victory over Celtic, this time 1ÿ0 thanks to a goal on the stroke of half time by club record scorer Dennis Wyness and won the First Division Championship, taking the club into the SPL.\\r\\nRobertson eventually left to become Hearts manager and was replaced by Dunfermline's Craig Brewster as player-manager.\\r\\nBrewster succeeded in keeping the club in the SPL. He also introduced new training regimes to increase player fitness and was successful in steering the club to good results against a number of established Premier League sides, including Rangers, Celtic, Motherwell, Hearts and Hibs. After a period of just over thirteen months at the club he left to become the new Dundee United manager after the sacking of Gordon Chisholm.\\r\\nFormer player Charlie Christie was appointed manager on 27 January 2006, after a successful spell as caretaker manager following the departure of Brewster, during which time Inverness achieved three wins out of three games played, including a record victory for the club in the SPL as they beat Falkirk 4ÿ1 away from home. He resigned on 19 August 2007 due to the pressures of the job, and because he believed it to be the correct decision for him and his family.[40] He has now resumed his former role, running the club's Centenary Club lottery.\\r\\nA short time after Christie resigned, Craig Brewster was reappointed. This was a controversial decision by the club, as Brewster had left to manage Dundee United only 18 months previously.\\r\\nHe was eventually sacked in January 2009, after a run of seven league defeats.[41] Prior to this, the ICT supporters had become increasingly concerned about poor performances and rumours of dressing room unrest, leading to a protest by fans at the team's 1ÿ0 defeat by Hamilton on the weekend before the sacking.[42]\\r\\nBrewster's successor, the former England international Terry Butcher was appointed on 27 January 2009, along with Maurice Malpas as his assistant. Terry Butcher managed in over 200 matches for the club, the 100th taking place on Friday 6 October 2012, in the 3ÿ1 win over Ross County[43] in the first SPL Highland derby.[44]\\r\\nIn November 2013, after nearly five years at Inverness, Hibernian reached a compensation deal with the club for Terry Butcher to move to Easter Road alongside assistant manager Maurice Malpas.[24]\\r\\nAfter an extensive recruitment process, on 4 December 2013, John Hughes was unveiled as the new manager of the club.[25] Hughes left Caledonian Thistle on the 20th May 2016, citing frustrations with his player budget and the club's failure to retain players.[45]\\r\\nLong-term player Richie Foran was announced as the new Inverness manager on the 30th May 2016, also announcing his player retirement.[46] Foran was in charge of Caley Thistle for just under one-year before being sacked on 29 May 2017.[37] During his time in charge, the club finished in last position in the Scottish Premiership, suffering relegation to the Scottish Championship on the final day of the season.[30]\\r\\nA few weeks after the sacking of Foran, former manager John Robertson, who brought the club into the Premiership for the first time in their history in 2004, returned to manage the club in a bid to get them back to top flight. Doing this, he became the second former manager to return to managing the club, after Craig Brewster left in 2006 and came back for a second spell in 2007.\\r\\nOver all competitions\\r\\nAt Telford Street Park\\r\\nAt Caledonian Stadium\\r\\nAt Pittodrie Stadium\\r\\nThough not a record, Inverness CT scored both the last Scottish League goal of the old millennium and the first goal of the new millennium, with both goals coming from Barry Wilson against Clydebank (27th December 1999) and Livingston (3rd January 2000) respectively.\\r\\nNotes","input":"Who is the manager of inverness caledonian thistle?"},{"output":"Pittsburgh Steelers","context":"Super Bowl Championships (4)\\r\\nConference Championships (5)\\r\\nDivisional Championships (15)\\r\\nThe RavensÿSteelers rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Baltimore Ravens and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Since the 2000s, it has widely been considered to be one of the greatest and most intense rivalries in the National Football League.[1][2] Both teams are members of the American Football Conference North division (formerly the AFC Central). Since the Ravens' inception in 1996, they have played at least twice a year, often for divisional supremacy. Both teams are known for fielding tough, hard-hitting defensive squads, giving their games an extra element of physical intensity.\\r\\nThe two teams have met in the postseason four times, with the Steelers owning a 3ÿ1 advantage. They are the only two teams in the AFC Central/North to have won the Super Bowl, and possess a combined 8ÿ2 record in the game, with the Ravens being 2ÿ0 and the Steelers being 6ÿ2. Both teams have won two Super Bowls since the rivalry began.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1996, NFL football returned to Baltimore, 12 years after the original Baltimore Colts moved to Indianapolis. In a strange twist of fate, Art Modell, former owner of the Steelers' traditional rival, the Cleveland Browns, agreed to suspend the Browns franchise in return for taking his players and personnel to Baltimore. The inter-divisional rivalry carried over with both teams remaining in what was then the AFC Central Division. On September 8, 1996, the Steelers handed Baltimore its first loss as a franchise, 31ÿ17 in Pittsburgh. In December, the Ravens defeated the playoff-bound Steelers by the same score in Baltimore. The Steelers would dominate the rivalry early on, winning six of the first seven meetings. However, since the AFC Central was restructured into the AFC North in 2002, the Ravens and Steelers have mostly dominated the division, whilst battling to a 17ÿ16 record. In 2005, Sports Illustrated ranked the rivalry #2 on a list of \\"Top 10 New NFL Rivalries\\".[3] By 2015, Bleacher Report had ranked it the #1 rivalry in all of the NFL.[4] One of the rivalry's most memorable moments was Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs being quoted as saying that a \\"bounty\\" was put out on the head of Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward. The bounty controversy was cleared up when Suggs insisted his words were just meant as a joke. The NFL investigated, and Suggs was cleared of any wrongdoing.\\r\\nIn Baltimore, it has the added element of a small number of former Colts fans in the area becoming Steeler fans after the Colts moved, then retaining their affiliation with the Steelers after the Ravens moved to Baltimore and assumed the Cleveland Browns' spot in the AFC Central with the Steelers. In Pittsburgh, it is considered the spiritual successor to the BrownsÿSteelers rivalry due to the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy as well as the \\"reactivated\\" Browns having a poor record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999.[6] Due to its physical nature, it has received comparisons to the rivalry the Steelers had with the Oakland Raiders in the 1970s, when those two teams were among the most physical teams in the league.[7] Both teams have also handed each other their first loss in their current stadiums; the Steelers handed the Ravens their first loss at PSINet Stadium (now M&T Bank Stadium) in 1998, while the Ravens returned the favor by handing the Steelers their first loss at Heinz Field in 2001.\\r\\nA notable battleground for the rivalry is the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania market area. Harrisburg is officially a secondary market for the Ravens, and so WHP-TV must show all Ravens road games (if played on Sunday afternoon). The Steelers also have a significant fan base in the area, so when the Ravens are at home, the Steelers are shown instead. The Harrisburg area also has a significant fan base for the Philadelphia Eagles, who also have Harrisburg as a secondary market (but are in the NFC as opposed to the Ravens and Steelers being in the AFC, and so the Fox affiliate usually shows the Eagles). The Colts had a number of fans in Harrisburg as well during their stay in Baltimore.\\r\\nThe Ravens and Steelers first met on September 8, 1996, at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which resulted in a 31ÿ17 win for the Steelers. Later in the 1996 NFL season, on December 1, the Ravens beat the Steelers by the same score of 31ÿ17 at Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Maryland. After splitting the games in their first season together, the Steelers would go on to mostly dominate the series in the early years, winning nine of thirteen meetings (including a Divisional Playoff game) before the AFC Central was restructured into the AFC North in 2002. From 2002 to 2007, the rivals split their games 6ÿ6, signaling a more competitive and fierce era for the rivalry.\\r\\nThe rivalry reached a new height of intensity during the 2008 NFL season, when the Ravens and Steelers played three times, the final match being the AFC Championship game. The Steelers won all three games by close margins. In Week 4 at Pittsburgh, the Steelers won on a 46-yard field goal in overtime. In Week 15 at Baltimore, the Steelers beat the Ravens with a controversial score late in the game, also winning the AFC North championship that game. In the playoff game, a personal foul by special teams player Daren Stone cost the Ravens 25 yards. The game's last score was an interception that was returned for a touchdown by Troy Polamalu, sealing a 23ÿ14 victory for Pittsburgh. In that same game the Steelers' Ryan Clark delivered a concussion-inducing, but legal hit on the Ravens' Willis McGahee that left Clark briefly out cold and forced McGahee to spend the night in a Pittsburgh hospital. The Steelers went on to win Super Bowl XLIII against the Arizona Cardinals.\\r\\nThe bitter rivalry continued in the 2009 NFL season; the Ravens won 20ÿ17 at M&T Bank Stadium and the Steelers won 23ÿ20 at Heinz Field. Both the Ravens and the Steelers finished the season with 9ÿ7 records, but Baltimore won a Wild Card slot over Pittsburgh due to a better division record. The Ravens won the Wild Card game by defeating the New England Patriots 33ÿ14, but lost to the Indianapolis Colts the following game.\\r\\nIn 2010, Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin called the RavensÿSteelers rivalry the best rivalry in football during a press conference and on the ESPN show Pardon the Interruption. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh later agreed with this assessment. The Ravens and Steelers met three times again in the 2010 NFL season, with the Ravens winning the first game and the Steelers winning the last two, including the Divisional Playoff game. On the opening Sunday of the 2011 NFL season, the Ravens forced seven turnovers and routed the Steelers 35ÿ7 at M&T Bank Stadium to avenge their Divisional Playoff loss to the Steelers from January.[8] During Week 9 of the season, the Steelers were on the verge of winning their game against the Ravens at Heinz Field. The Steelers were ready to potentially increase their lead with a 47-yard field goal kick by Shaun Suisham, but a five-yard delay of game penalty put them out of field goal range and they instead decided to punt the ball to the Ravens. In the end, Joe Flacco threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Torrey Smith in the end zone with just eight seconds remaining, giving the Ravens the win and a season sweep of the Steelers. This would mark the last time Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis would play against the Steelers, as he was injured during the teams' two meetings in 2012 and retired following his win in Super Bowl XLVII.\\r\\nIn the 2012 NFL season, the Ravens and Steelers split their games; the road team won each meeting with a Ravens win at Heinz Field and a Steelers win at M&T Bank Stadium. The rivalry saw a rare moment of peace on September 23, 2012, when Ravens receiver Torrey Smith received news that his brother died in a motorcycle accident early in the morning. Following an inspired, two-touchdown and 127-yard performance in a 31ÿ30 win over the New England Patriots, Smith noted that several players across the NFL, including members of the Pittsburgh Steelers, had contacted him to express their condolences.[9] The Ravens captured their second consecutive AFC North championship in 2012 (having also won the division in 2011), and won Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers at the end of the season.\\r\\nOn October 20, 2013, at Heinz Field, the Steelers won 19ÿ16 on a Shaun Suisham field goal as time expired after Ben Roethlisberger drove the Steelers into field goal range. Later that year, the two teams met at M&T Bank Stadium for a prime-time match-up on Thanksgiving Day, giving the Ravens their second Thanksgiving game in three years and the Steelers their first Thanksgiving game since the infamous Jerome Bettis coin-toss fiasco in 1998. It was also the first time the two teams played each other on Thanksgiving. The Ravens won the game 22ÿ20 in a nail biter, preventing a last-minute 2-point conversion and forcing a split between the rivals in the 2013 NFL season. The game included an infamous moment when Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin interfered on the sidelines with what would have possibly been a return touchdown by Jacoby Jones, eventually resulting in a $100,000 fine.\\r\\nIn Week 2 of the 2014 NFL season, the Ravens beat the Steelers 26ÿ6 at M&T Bank Stadium, which marked the first time since 2011 that the Steelers did not score a touchdown in a game. In Week 9, the Steelers defeated the Ravens 43ÿ23 at Heinz Field. Unlike the typical, close games of the rivalry, each team had beaten the other by 20 points at their respective home fields in the regular season. At halftime during the Week 9 game, the Steelers retired Jersey No. 75 in honor of defensive tackle Joe Greene, who had helped lead the legendary \\"Steel Curtain\\" defense of the 1970s. Though the Steelers went on to win the AFC North with an 11ÿ5 record in the 2014 season, the 10ÿ6 Ravens would earn their first playoff victory over their rival on January 3, 2015, with a 30ÿ17 win at Heinz Field in the Wild Card round.\\r\\nThe 2ÿ1 Steelers hosted the 0ÿ3 Ravens at Heinz Field for a prime-time game in Week 4 of the 2015 NFL season. With Roethlisberger injured, the Steelers started Michael Vick in the contest. The Steelers built a 20ÿ7 lead by the third quarter, but the Ravens were able to rally and bring the game into overtime 20ÿ20, with 13 unanswered points by the offense and two missed field goals by Steelers' kicker Josh Scobee. Ravens' kicker Justin Tucker won the game on a 52-yard field goal to give the Ravens their first win of the year, also improving the Ravens' record to 4ÿ1 against the Steelers in overtime games. The two teams met again at M&T Bank Stadium in Week 16 for their second meeting of the season. The Ravens started Ryan Mallett in the game since Joe Flacco had suffered a season-ending injury several weeks before. Despite being big underdogs due to injuries and a subpar record, the Ravens were able to complete a sweep of the Steelers with a 20ÿ17 upset victory.\\r\\nIn the ninth week of the 2016 NFL season, the 4ÿ3 Steelers and 3ÿ4 Ravens met at M&T Bank Stadium, each team having an opportunity to gain control of the AFC North. Behind a defense that shut out the Steelers for the first three quarters, the Ravens emerged victorious 21ÿ14, taking the lead in the division and evening the teams' records at 4ÿ4. In the rematch at Heinz Field on Christmas Day, the 9ÿ5 Steelers prevailed over the 8ÿ6 Ravens in a back-and-forth game 31ÿ27, snapping a four-game losing streak to the Ravens. The win secured the AFC North championship for Pittsburgh and eliminated Baltimore from playoff contention. On October 1, 2017, the Steelers beat the Ravens 26ÿ9 at M&T Bank Stadium, which gave the Steelers their first win in Baltimore since 2012. The Steelers completed a sweep of the Ravens in the 2017 NFL season with a 39ÿ38 victory at Heinz Field on December 10, 2017. The victory also clinched the division for the Steelers for the second consecutive season.\\r\\nThe following is a list of results from all of the meetings between the Ravens and Steelers, from their first meeting on September 8, 1996, to the present:\\r\\nNajeh Davenport tries to escape from the Ravens defense, 2006.\\r\\nBen Roethlisberger getting sacked by the Ravens, 2006.\\r\\nRoethlisberger hands off to Willie Parker, 2006.\\r\\nCaptains from both teams meet for the coin toss, 2006\\r\\nTyrone Carter (23) and Anthony Madison (37) prepare to tackle a Raven runner, 2006.\\r\\nBen Roethlisberger, Trevor Pryce (90), and Terrell Suggs (55) in 2006.\\r\\nHines Ward makes a catch for the Steelers, 2006.\\r\\nParker running against Ravens players (left to right) Haloti Ngata, Ray Lewis, and Terrell Suggs, 2006.\\r\\nRay Lewis (52) and Terrell Suggs (55) of the Ravens chase down Steelers runningback Parker, 2006.\\r\\nThe Ravens walking off the field after beating the Steelers, 2006.\\r\\nA game in 2008.

He was the most celebrated violin virtuoso of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNiccol Paganini was born in Genoa, then capital of the Republic of Genoa, the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (ne Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the mandolin. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to Parma to seek further guidance from Alessandro Rolla. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, Ferdinando Paer and, later, Paer's own teacher, Gasparo Ghiretti. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\\r\\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near Bolzaneto. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.[1] He became rather adept on this instrument, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.[2] He later described the guitar as his \\"constant companion\\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to Livorno, where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the Republic of Lucca, but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\\r\\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by Napoleonic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, Elisa Baciocchi. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, Felice. In 1807, Baciocchi became the Grand Duchess of Tuscany and her court was transferred to Florence. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\\r\\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at La Scala in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with Charles Philippe Lafont and Louis Spohr created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\\r\\nIn 1827, Pope Leo XII honoured Paganini with the Order of the Golden Spur.[3][4] His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as Rodolphe Kreutzer and Giovanni Battista Viotti.\\r\\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including Ferdinando Carulli in Paris and Mauro Giuliani in Vienna.[5] But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\\r\\nThroughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by Marfan syndrome[6][7] or EhlersÿDanlos syndrome.[8] In addition, his frequent concert schedule, as well as his extravagant lifestyle, took their toll on his health. He was diagnosed with syphilis as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included mercury and opium, came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for tuberculosis. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\\r\\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist Camillo Sivori and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso Apollinaire de Kontski, giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\\r\\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.[3]\\r\\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His remains were finally laid to rest in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist Franti?ek Ond??ek persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this bizarre episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\\r\\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achilles Cyrus Alexander, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achilles on his European tours, and Achilles later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\\r\\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers Gioachino Rossini and Hector Berlioz. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera Matilde di Shabran, upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\\r\\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato Harold en Italie. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist Christian Urhan. He did however write his own Sonata per Gran Viola Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in Harold, Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of Beethoven and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its sound box.\\r\\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine string instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in Livorno, a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier Giuseppe Guarneri, for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as Il Cannone Guarnerius.[9] On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\\r\\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the Antonio Amati 1600, the Nicol Amati 1657, the Paganini-Desaint 1680 Stradivari, the Guarneri-filius Andrea 1706, the Le Brun 1712 Stradivari, the Vuillaume c.?1720 Bergonzi, the Hubay 1726 Stradivari, and the Comte?Cozio di Salabue 1727 violins; the Countess of Flanders 1582 da?Sal-di?Bertolotti, and the Mendelssohn 1731 Stradivari violas; the Piatti 1700 Goffriller, the Stanlein 1707 Stradivari, and the Ladenburg 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the Grobert of Mirecourt 1820 (guitar).[10][11] Four of these instruments were played by the Tokyo String Quartet.\\r\\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of Mirecourt. The luthier made his instrument in the style of Ren Lacote, a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the Muse de la Musique in Paris.\\r\\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played Stauffer guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\\r\\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His 24 Caprices were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including Le Streghe, The Carnival of Venice, and Nel cor pi non mi sento, were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\\r\\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the timbre of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled Il Fandango Spanolo (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece Duetto Amoroso, in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the Duetto, which has been recorded. The existence of the Fandango is known only through concert posters.\\r\\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by Eugne Ysa?e.[12] Yehudi Menuhin, on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.[9] The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as Paisiello, Rossini and Donizetti, who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.[13]\\r\\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \\"La Campanella\\" and the A?minor Caprice (No.?24) have been an object of interest for a number of composers. Franz Liszt, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Boris Blacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, George Rochberg and Witold Lutos?awski, among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\\r\\nThe Israeli violinist Ivry Gitlis once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. Arcangelo Corelli (1653ÿ1713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the Sonatas and Partitas BWV 1001ÿ1006 of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685ÿ1750). Other notable violinists included Antonio Vivaldi (1678ÿ1741) and Giuseppe Tartini (1692ÿ1770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\\r\\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, Pietro Locatelli (1693ÿ1746) and August Duranowski (Auguste Frdric Durand) (1770ÿ1834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled L'arte di nuova modulazione ÿ Capricci enigmatici or The art of the new style ÿ the enigmatic caprices). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of Giovanni Battista Viotti (1755ÿ1824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics and the left hand pizzicato in his performance. Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\\r\\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of Marfan syndrome.[14]\\r\\nNotable works inspired by compositions of Paganini include:\\r\\nThe Caprice No. 24 in A minor, Op. 1, (Tema con variazioni) has been the basis of works by many other composers. Notable examples include Brahms's Variations on a Theme of Paganini and Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.\\r\\nThe Paganini Competition (Premio Paganini) is an international violin competition created in 1954 in his home city of Genoa and named in his honour.\\r\\nIn 1972 the State of Italy purchased a large collection of Niccol Paganini manuscripts from the W. Heyer Library of Cologne. They are housed at the Biblioteca Casanatense in Rome.[15]\\r\\nIn 1982 the city of Genoa commissioned a thematic catalogue of music by Paganini, edited by Maria Rosa Moretti and Anna Sorrento, hence the abbreviation \\"MS\\" assigned to his catalogued works.[16]\\r\\nA minor planet 2859 Paganini discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh is named after him.[17]\\r\\nAlthough no photographs of Paganini are known to exist, in 1900 Italian violin maker Giuseppe Fiorini forged the now famous fake daguerreotype of the celebrated violinist.[18] So well in fact, that even the great classical author and conversationalist Arthur M. Abell was led to believe it to be true, reprinting the image in the 22 January 1901 issue of the Musical Courier.[19]\\r\\nPaganini has been portrayed by a number of actors in film and television productions, including Stewart Granger in the 1946 biographical portrait The Magic Bow, Roxy Roth in A Song to Remember (1945), Klaus Kinski in Kinski Paganini (1989)[20] and David Garrett in The Devil's Violinist (2013).[21]\\r\\nIn the Soviet 1982 miniseries Niccolo Paganini the musician is portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan. The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, plays Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious Jesuit official. The information in the series is generally spurious and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.[22] He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\\r\\nIn Don Nigro's satirical comedy Paganini (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly sold his soul to the Devil. \\"Variation upon variation,\\" he cries at one point, \\"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \\"rescued\\" by the Devil who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvationadministered by a god-like Clockmakerturns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \\"Do not pity him, my dear,\\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \\"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\\"\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nSources\\r\\nImages","input":"Who was the greatest violin virtuoso in the romantic period?"},{"output":"casein protein (a longer-lasting protein)","context":"Cottage cheese is a fresh cheese curd product with a mild flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first known use of the term \\"cottage cheese\\" dates back to 1831.[1] It is believed to have originated because the simple cheese was usually made in cottages from any milk left over after making butter.[citation needed]\\r\\nCottage cheese is drained, but not pressed, so some whey remains and the individual curds remain loose. The curd is usually washed to remove acidity, giving sweet-curd cheese. It is not aged or colored. Different styles of cottage cheese are made from milk with different fat levels and in small-curd or large-curd preparations. Pressed cottage cheese becomes hoop cheese, farmer cheese, pot cheese, or queso blanco.\\r\\nCurd size is the size of the chunks in the cottage cheese. The two major types of cottage cheese are small-curd, high-acid cheese made without rennet, and large-curd, low-acid cheese made with rennet. Rennet is a natural complex of enzymes that speeds curdling and keeps the curd that forms from breaking up. Adding rennet shortens the cheese-making process, resulting in a lower acid and larger curd cheese, and reduces the amount of curd poured off with leftover liquid (whey).[2] Sometimes large-curd cottage cheese is called \\"chunk style.\\"\\r\\nCottage cheese can be eaten in a variety of different ways: by itself, with fruit and sugar, with salt and pepper, with fruit puree, on toast, with tomatoes, with granola and cinnamon, in salads, as a chip dip, as a replacement for mayonnaise in tuna salad or used as an ingredient in recipes such as jello salad and various desserts. Cottage cheese with fruit such as pears, peaches, or mandarin oranges is a standard side dish in many \\"home cooking\\" or meat-and-three restaurants' menus in the United States.

A fat-free kind of a similar serving size has 80 calories, 0?g fat (0?g saturated), 6?g carbohydrates, and 14?g protein.\\r\\nCottage cheese is popular among dieters and some health food devotees. It is a favorite food among bodybuilders, runners, swimmers and weightlifters for its high content of casein protein (a longer-lasting protein) while being relatively low in fat.

Instituted in 1954, the award is conferred \\"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.[2][3][4] The award was originally limited to achievements in the arts, literature, science, and public services, but the government expanded the criteria to include \\"any field of human endeavour\\" in December 2011.[5] The recommendations for the Bharat Ratna are made by the Prime Minister to the President, with a maximum of three nominees being awarded per year. Recipients receive a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a peepal-leafÿshaped medallion; there is no monetary grant associated with the award. Bharat Ratna recipients rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.\\r\\nThe first recipients of the Bharat Ratna were politician C. Rajagopalachari, philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and scientist C. V. Raman, who were honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 45 individuals, including 12 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. The former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first individual to be honoured posthumously. In 2014, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, then aged 40, became the youngest recipient; while social reformer Dhondo Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one naturalised citizen, Mother Teresa, and to two non-Indians, Pakistan national Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and former South African President Nelson Mandela. On 24 December 2014, the Indian government announced the award to independence activist Madan Mohan Malaviya (posthumously) and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna, along with other personal civil honours, was briefly suspended from July 1977 to January 1980, during the change in the national government; and for a second time from August 1992 to December 1995, when several public-interest litigations challenged the constitutional validity of the awards. In 1992, the government's decision to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose was opposed by those who had refused to accept the fact of his death, including some members of his extended family. Following a 1997 Supreme Court decision, the press communiqu announcing Bose's award was cancelled; it is the only time when the award was announced but not conferred.\\r\\nSeveral bestowals of the award have met with criticism. The posthumous award for M. G. Ramachandran (1988) was considered to have been aimed at placating the voters for the upcoming assembly election and posthumous awards of Madan Mohan Malaviya (2015) and Vallabhbhai Patel (1991) drew criticism for they died before the award was instituted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 2 January 1954, a press communiqu was released from the office of the secretary to the President announcing the creation of two civilian awardsBharat Ratna, the highest civilian award, and the three-tier Padma Vibhushan, classified into \\"Pahela Warg\\" (Class I), \\"Dusra Warg\\" (Class II), and \\"Tisra Warg\\" (Class III), which rank below the Bharat Ratna.[2] On 15 January 1955, the Padma Vibhushan was reclassified into three different awards; the Padma Vibhushan, the highest of the three, followed by the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Shri.[3]\\r\\nThere is no formal provision that recipients of the Bharat Ratna should be Indian citizens. It has been awarded to a naturalised Indian citizen, Mother Teresa in 1980, and to two non-Indians, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Pakistan in 1987 and the former South African president Nelson Mandela in 1990.[6] Sachin Tendulkar, at the age of 40, became the youngest person and first athlete to receive the honour.[7] In a special ceremony on 18 April 1958, Dhondo Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday.[8][a] As of 2015, the award has been conferred upon 45 people with 12 posthumous declarations.[10]\\r\\nThe award was briefly suspended twice in its history.[11] The first suspension occurred after Morarji Desai was sworn in as the fourth Prime Minister in 1977. His government withdrew all personal civil honours on 13 July 1977.[12][13] The suspension was rescinded on 25 January 1980, after Indira Gandhi became the Prime Minister.[14][15] The civilian awards were suspended again in mid-1992, when two Public-Interest Litigations were filed, one in the Kerala High Court and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, challenging the \\"constitutional validity\\" of the awards.[11] The awards were reintroduced by the Supreme Court in December 1995, following the conclusion of the litigation.[13][16]\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna is conferred \\"in recognition of exceptional service/performance of the highest order\\", without distinction of race, occupation, position, or sex.[4] The award was originally confined to the arts, literature, science, and public services, as per the 1954 regulations.[2] In December 2011, the rules were changed to include \\"any field of human endeavour\\".[5] The 1954 statutes did not allow posthumous awards, but this was subsequently modified in the January 1955 statute, and Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first recipient to be honoured posthumously in 1966.[3][17]\\r\\nAlthough there is no formal nomination process, recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President with a maximum number of three nominees being awarded per year. However, in 1999, four individuals were awarded the honour. The recipient receives a Sanad (certificate) signed by the President and a medallion without any monetary grant. Under the terms of Article 18 (1) of the Constitution,[b] the recipients cannot use the award as a prefix or suffix to their name, although recipients may use either the expressions \\"Awarded Bharat Ratna by the President\\" or \\"Recipient of Bharat Ratna Award\\" to indicate that they have been honoured with the award.[4] The holders of the Bharat Ratna rank seventh in the Indian order of precedence.[19]\\r\\nAs with many official announcements, recipients are announced and registered in The Gazette of India, a publication released by the Department of Publication, Ministry of Urban Development used for official government notices; without publication in the Gazette, conferral of the award is not considered official. Recipients whose awards have been revoked or restored, both of which require the authority of the President, are registered in the Gazette. Recipients whose awards have been revoked are required to surrender their medals, and their names are struck from the register.[2][3]\\r\\nThe original 1954 specifications of the award was a circle made of gold 1?3?8 inches (35?mm) in diameter with a centred sun burst design on the obverse side. The text \\"Bharat Ratna\\", in Devanagari Script, is inscribed on the upper edge in silver gilt with a wreath set along on the lower edge. A platinum State Emblem of India was placed in the centre of the reverse side with the national motto, \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" (Truth alone triumphs) in Devanagari Script, inscribed in silver-gilt on the lower edge.[2]\\r\\nA year later, the design was modified. The current medal is in the shape of a peepal leaf, approximately 2?5?16 inches (59?mm) long, 1?7?8 inches (48?mm) wide and 1?8 inch (3.2?mm) thick and rimmed in platinum. The embossed sun burst design, made of platinum, on the obverse side of the medal has a diameter of 5?8 inch (16?mm) with rays spreading out from 5?6 inch (21?mm) to 1?2 inch (13?mm) from the center of the Sun. The words \\"Bharat Ratna\\" on the obverse side remained the same as the 1954 design as did the emblem of India and \\"Satyameva Jayate\\" on the reverse side. A 2-inch-wide (51?mm) white ribbon is attached to the medal so it can be worn around the neck.[3][11][20] In 1957, the silver-gilt decoration was changed to burnished bronze.[2][21] The Bharat Ratna medals are produced at Alipore Mint, Kolkata along with the other civilian and military awards like Padma Vibushan, Padma Bhushan, Padma Shri, and Param Veer Chakra.[22]\\r\\nThe Bharat Ratna has been surrounded by several controversies and multiple Public-Interest Litigations (PIL) had been filed against the conferral of the award.[13][23][24][25][26]\\r\\nOn 23 January 1992, a press release was published by the President's Secretariat to confer the award posthumously on Subhash Chandra Bose. The decision triggered much criticism and a PIL was filed in the Calcutta High Court to revoke the award.[23] The petitioner took objection to the conferral of the award and its posthumous mention of Bose, saying that honouring a personality higher than the award is \\"ridiculous\\", and it was an act of \\"carelessness\\" to classify such a person with past and future recipients. It said that the award cannot be conferred to Bose posthumously as the Government had not officially accepted his death on 18 August 1945. The petitioner requested the whereabouts of Bose from 18 August 1945 till date, based on the information collected by the 1956 Shah Nawaz Committee and the 1970 Khosla Commission. Bose's family members expressed their unwillingness to accept the award.[27][28]\\r\\nTo deliver the judgement, the Supreme Court formed a Special Division Bench with Judge Sujata V. Manohar and G. B. Pattanaik. The Solicitor General noted that to confer the award per the appropriate regulations pertaining to the Bharat Ratna, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Shri, the name of the recipient must be published in The Gazette of India and entered in the recipients register maintained under the direction of the President.[2] It was noted that only an announcement had been made by press communiqu, but the government had not proceeded to confer the award by publishing the name in the Gazette and entering the name in the register. Furthermore, the then presidents, R. Venkataraman (1987ÿ92) and Shankar Dayal Sharma (1992ÿ97), had not conferred a Sanad (certificate) with their signature and seal.[27]\\r\\nOn 4 August 1997, the Supreme Court delivered an order that since the award had not been officially conferred, it cannot be revoked and declared that the press communiqu be treated as cancelled. The court declined to pass any judgement on the posthumous mention of Bose and his death.[27][29]\\r\\nIn 1992, two PILs were filed in the High Courts; one in the Kerala High Court on 13 February 1992 by Balaji Raghavan and another in the Madhya Pradesh High Court (Indore Bench) on 24 August 1992 by Satya Pal Anand. Both petitioners questioned the civilian awards being \\"Titles\\" per an interpretation of Article 18 (1) of the Constitution.[b] On 25 August 1992, the Madhya Pradesh High Court issued a notice temporarily suspending all civilian awards.[13] A Special Division Bench of the Supreme Court was formed comprising five judges; A. M. Ahmadi C. J., Kuldip Singh, B. P. Jeevan Reddy, N. P. Singh, and S. Saghir Ahmad. On 15 December 1995, the Special Division Bench restored the awards and delivered a judgement that the \\"Bharat Ratna and Padma awards are not titles under Article 18 of the Constitution\\".[16]\\r\\nFollowing the announcement, in November 2013, that C. N. R. Rao and Sachin Tendulkar were to be awarded the Bharat Ratna, multiple PILs were filed challenging the conferring of the award. The PIL filed against Rao declared that other Indian scientists, such as Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai, had contributed more than Rao and his claim of publishing 1400 research papers was \\"physically impossible\\". The suit stated that as Rao had proven cases of plagiarism, he should not be presented with the award but rather should be annulled.[24] The PIL filed against Tendulkar to the Election Commission under the Right to Information Act indicated that the awarding him the Bharat Ratna was a violation of the model code of conduct. The petitioner noted that as Tendulkar was an Indian National Congress nominated Member of Rajya Sabha, the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna would influence the voters of Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Mizoram where the election process was underway at the time.[25] Another PIL was filed against Tendulkar and a few ministers, \\"alleging a conspiracy to ignore\\" an Indian field hockey player Dhyan Chand.\\"[26][c]\\r\\nOn 4 December 2013, the Election Commission rejected the petition stating that conferring the award on people from non-polling states did not amount to a violation of the code.[30] Other High Courts as well rejected the petitions raised against Rao and Tendulkar.[31]\\r\\nIn 1988, then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi (1984ÿ89) conferred the Bharat Ratna posthumously on film actor and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. G. Ramachandran, in a bid to influence voters prior to the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1989.[32][33] The decision was criticised for awarding Ramachandran before independence activist B. R. Ambedkar and Vallabhbhai Patel, who were bestowed the honour in 1990 and 1991 respectively.[34] While Ravi Shankar was accused of lobbying for the award,[35] the decision by Indira Gandhi to posthumously honour K. Kamaraj was considered to have been aimed at placating Tamil voters for the Tamil Nadu assembly elections in 1977. The seventh Prime Minister V. P. Singh was criticised for posthumously honouring B. R. Ambedkar to please Dalits.[36][32]\\r\\nThe posthumous conferments of the award on the recipients who died before the Indian independence in 1947 or the award was instituted in 1954 have been criticised by historians.[37] It was noted that such conferments could lead to more demands to honour people like Maurya Emperor Ashoka,[38] Mughal Emperor Akbar, Maratha Emperor Shivaji, Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore,[39] Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda,[40] and independence activist Bal Gangadhar Tilak.[41] The then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao (1991ÿ96) was criticised for bestowing the award upon Vallabhbhai Patel in 1991, 41 years after his death in 1950; and upon Subhas Chandra Bose in 1992, who went missing since 18 August 1945.[41][42] Similarly in 2015, the incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to award Madan Mohan Malaviya, who died in 1946, met with criticism.[41] Janardan Dwivedi, politician of the Indian National Congress, said that Malaviya, who worked predominantly in Varanasi, was \\"deliberately chosen\\" by the Prime Minister Modi, who is the incumbent Member of Parliament from Varanasi.[43]\\r\\nA few of the conferments have been criticised for honouring personalities only after they received global recognition.[44] The award for Mother Teresa was announced in 1980, a year after she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Satyajit Ray received an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 followed by the Bharat Ratna the same year.[45][46] In 1999, Amartya Sen was awarded the Bharat Ratna, a year after his 1998 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The award was proposed by President K. R. Narayanan to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee who agreed to the proposal.[47][48]\\r\\nThough, as per the statutes for the Bharat Ratna, the recommendations for the award can only be made by the Prime Minister to the President,[4] there have been several demands from various political parties to honour their leaders. In January 2008, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader L. K. Advani wrote to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommending Singh's predecessor Atal Bihari Vajpayee for the award.[49][50] This was immediately followed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) lobbying for their leader, Jyoti Basu, former Chief Minister of West Bengal.[51] Basu, India's longest-serving chief minister, said that he would decline the honour, even if awarded.[52] Similar demands were made by Telugu Desam Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, and Shiromani Akali Dal for their respective leaders N. T. Rama Rao, Kanshi Ram, and Parkash Singh Badal.[53] In September 2015, regional political party Shiv Sena demanded the award for the independence activist Vinayak Damodar Savarkar stating that he had been \\"deliberately neglected by previous governments\\" but his family clarified that they are not making such demand and that the freedom fighter is known for his contribution towards independence movement and did not need an award for recognition.[54]\\r\\nPer the original statutes, sportspersons were not eligible for the Bharat Ratna; however, a revision of the rules in December 2011 made eligible \\"any field of human endeavour\\".[5] Subsequently, several sportspersons' names were discussed; among the most talked-about of these was field-hockey player Dhyan Chand, who was recommended multiple times for the posthumous honour.[55] In 2011, 82 members of parliament recommended Chand's name for the award to the Prime Minister's Office. In January 2012, the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports forwarded his name again, this time along with 2008 Summer Olympics gold medallist shooter Abhinav Bindra and mountaineer Tenzing Norgay.[56] Bindra had earlier been recommended for the award in May 2013 by the National Rifle Association of India.[57] In July 2013, the ministry again recommended Dhyan Chand.[56][58] However, in November 2013, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar became the first sports-person to receive the honour and this garnered much criticism for the government.[7][59]\\r\\nA PIL was filed in the Karnataka High Court where in the petitioner requested the court to issue a direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs to consider their representation dated 26 October 2012 and confer the Bharat Ratna upon Mahatma Gandhi. On 27 January 2014, a counsel appearing for the petitioner noted that after multiple representations from the petitioner, they were provided with the information under RTI that the recommendations to confer the award on Gandhi have been received multiple times in the past and were forwarded to the Prime Minister's Office. A Division bench comprising Chief Justice D.H. Waghela and Justice B.V. Nagarathna dismissed the petition stating that the subject is not amenable to any adjudication process and the nominations and conferment process is stated to be informal and in the discretion of the highest authority in the Government.[60][61]\\r\\n[107]","input":"Who was the first indian to receive bharat ratan?"},{"output":"April 11, 1953","context":"The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), also known as the Health Department, is a cabinet-level department of the U.S. federal government with the goal of protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services.

The Reorganization Plan abolished the FSA and transferred all of its functions to the Secretary of HEW and all components of the Agency to the Department. The first Secretary of HEW was Oveta Culp Hobby, a native of Texas, who had served as Commander of the Women's Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the Houston Post. Sworn in on April 11, 1953, as Secretary, she had been FSA Administrator since January 21, 1953.\\r\\nThe six major program-operating components of the new Department were the Public Health Service, the Office of Education, the Food and Drug Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, and St. Elizabeth's Hospital. The Department was also responsible for three federally aided corporations: Howard University, the American Printing House for the Blind, and the Columbia Institution for the Deaf (Gallaudet College since 1954).[4]\\r\\nList of Secretaries of Health, Education, and Welfare[4]\\r\\nThe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was renamed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 1979,[5] when its education functions were transferred to the newly created United States Department of Education under the Department of Education Organization Act.[6] HHS was left in charge of the Social Security Administration, agencies constituting the Public Health Service, and Family Support Administration.\\r\\nIn 1995, the Social Security Administration was removed from the Department of Health and Human Services, and established as an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States Government.\\r\\nHHS is administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The United States Public Health Service (PHS) is the main division of the HHS and is led by the Assistant Secretary for Health. The current Secretary, Eric Hargan, assumed office on October 10, 2017, serving in an Acting capacity.\\r\\nThe United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the uniformed service of the PHS, is led by the Surgeon General who is responsible for addressing matters concerning public health as authorized by the Secretary or by the Assistant Secretary of Health in addition to his or her primary mission of administering the Commissioned Corps.\\r\\nThere are three tiers of health departments, the federal health department, state health department and local health department. In relation with state and local government, the federal government provides states with funding to ensure that states are able to retain current programs and are able to implement new programs. The coordination between all three health departments is critical to ensure the programs being implemented are well structured and suited to the corresponding level of health department. The health department at state level needs to safeguard good relations with legislators as well as governors in order to acquire legal and financial aid to guarantee the development and enhancements of the programs. Assemblies are set up to guide the relationships between state and local health departments. The state sets up the regulations and health policies whereas the local health departments are the ones implementing the health policies and services.[7][8]\\r\\nThe Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates criminal activity for HHS. The special agents who work for OIG have the same title series \\"1811\\", training and authority as other federal criminal investigators, such as the FBI, ATF, DEA and Secret Service. However, OIG Special Agents have special skills in investigating white collar crime related to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Organized crime has dominated the criminal activity relative to this type of fraud.\\r\\nHHS-OIG investigates tens of millions of dollars in Medicare fraud each year. In addition, OIG will continue its coverage of all 50 states and the District of Columbia by its multi-agency task forces (PSOC Task Forces) that identify, investigate, and prosecute individuals who willfully avoid payment of their child support obligations under the Child Support Recovery Act.\\r\\nHHS-OIG agents also provide protective services to the Secretary of HHS, and other department executives as necessary.\\r\\nIn 2002, the department released Healthy People 2010, a national strategic initiative for improving the health of Americans.\\r\\nWith the passage of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 of 2009, and the Affordable Care Act of 2010, the Office of the Inspector General has taken an emboldened stance against healthcare related non-compliance, most notably for violations of Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute.[9]\\r\\nIn 2015, the OIG issued a fraud alert as a warning to hospitals and healthcare systems to monitor and comply with their physician compensation arrangements.[10]\\r\\nRecent years have seen dramatic increases in both the number and the amounts of Stark Law violation settlements, prompting healthcare experts to identify a need for automated solutions that manage physician arrangements by centralizing necessary information with regard to physician-hospital integration.[11] Contract management software companies such as Meditract provide options for health systems to organize and store physician contracts. Ludi Inc introduced DocTime Log?, an SaaS solution that specifically addresses this growing concern, automating physician time logging in compliance with contract terms to eliminate Stark Law and Anti-Kickback Statute violations.[12]\\r\\nIn June 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services created the Strengthening Communities Fund[13] as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The fund was appropriated $50 million to be given as grants to organizations in the United States who were engaged in Capacity Building programs. The grants were given to two different types of capacity builders:\\r\\nand building up nonprofit organization's abilities to tackle economic problems. State, Local and Tribal governments can receive up to $250,000 in two year grants\\r\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is led by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, a member of the United States Cabinet appointed by the President of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate. The Secretary is assisted in managing the Department by the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services, who is also appointed by the President. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary are further assisted by seven Assistant Secretaries, who serve as top Departmental administrators.\\r\\nAs of Jan. 20, 2018, this is the top level of the organizational chart. HHS provides further organizational detail on its website.\\r\\nSeveral agencies within HHS are components of the Public Health Service (PHS), as noted below.\\r\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services was authorized a budget for fiscal year 2015 of $1.020 trillion. The budget authorization is broken down as follows:[15]\\r\\nHHS.Gov provides complete details on current and historical budgets for that agency.[16] Budgets for fiscal years prior to 2014 are archived by Archive-It as requested by HHS.\\r\\nThe Department of Health and Human Services' administers 115 programs across its 11 operating divisions.[26] The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) aims to \\"protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.\\"[27] These federal programs consist of social service programs, civil rights and healthcare privacy programs, disaster preparedness programs, and health related research. HHS offers a variety of social service programs geared toward persons with low income, disabilities, military families, and senior citizens. [28] Healthcare rights are defined under HHS in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which protect patients privacy in regards to medical information, protects workers health insurance when unemployed, and sets guidelines surrounding some health insurance. HHS collaborates with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and Office of Emergency Management to prepare and respond to health emergencies.[29][30] A broad array of health related research is supported or completed under the HHS; secondarily under HHS, the Health Resources & Service Administration houses data warehouses and makes health data available surrounding a multitude of topics.[31] [32] HHS also has vast offering of health related resources and tools to help educate the public on health policies and pertinent population health information. Some examples of available resources include disease prevention, wellness, health insurance information, as well as links to healthcare providers and facilities, meaningful health related materials, public health and safety information.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\\r\\nSome highlights include:\\r\\nIn the latest Center for Effective Government analysis of 15 federal agencies which receive the most Freedom of Information Act (United States) (FOIA) requests published in 2015 (using 2012 and 2013 data, the most recent years available), the DHHS ranked second to last, earning an F by scoring 57 out of a possible 100 points, largely due to a low score on its particular disclosure rules. It had deteriorated from a D- in 2013.[40]\\r\\nThe 2010 United States federal budget established a reserve fund of more than $630 billion over 10 years to finance fundamental reform of the health care system.[41]","input":"When was the department of health and human services established?"},{"output":"autophagy","context":"A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle found in nearly all animal cells. They are spherical vesicles which contain hydrolytic enzymes that can break down many kinds of biomolecules. Simply stated, a lysosome is a type of vesicle with specific composition, of both its membrane proteins, and proteins of its lumen. The lumen's pH (4.5ÿ5.0)[1] is optimal for the enzymes involved in hydrolysis, analogous to the activity of the stomach. Besides degradation of polymers, the lysosome is involved in various cell processes, including secretion, plasma membrane repair, cell signaling, and energy metabolism.[2]\\r\\nThe lysosomes also act as the waste disposal system of the cell by digesting unwanted materials in the cytoplasm, both from outside the cell and obsolete components inside the cell. Material from outside the cell is taken-up through endocytosis, while material from the inside of the cell is digested through autophagy. Their sizes can be very differentthe biggest ones can be more than 10 times bigger than the smallest ones.[3] They were discovered and named by Belgian biologist Christian de Duve, who eventually received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974.\\r\\nLysosomes are known to contain more than 60 different enzymes.[4][5] Enzymes of the lysosomes are synthesised in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The enzymes are imported from the Golgi apparatus in small vesicles, which fuse with larger acidic vesicles. Enzymes destined for a lysosome are specifically tagged with the molecule mannose 6-phosphate, so that they are properly sorted into acidified vesicles.[6][7]\\r\\nSynthesis of lysosomal enzymes is controlled by nuclear genes. Mutations in the genes for these enzymes are responsible for more than 30 different human genetic disorders, which are collectively known as lysosomal storage diseases. These diseases result from an accumulation of specific substrates, due to the inability to break them down. These genetic defects are related to several neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and ageing-related diseases.[8][9]\\r\\nLysosomes should not be confused with liposomes, or with micelles.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nChristian de Duve, the chairman of the Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium, had been studying the mechanism of action of a pancreatic hormone insulin in liver cells. By 1949, he and his team had focused on the enzyme called glucose 6-phosphatase, which is the first crucial enzyme in sugar metabolism and the target of insulin. They already suspected that this enzyme played a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. However, even after a series of experiments, they failed to purify and isolate the enzyme from the cellular extracts. Therefore, they tried a more arduous procedure of cell fractionation, by which cellular components are separated based on their sizes using centrifugation.\\r\\nThey succeeded in detecting the enzyme activity from the microsomal fraction. This was the crucial step in the serendipitous discovery of lysosomes. To estimate this enzyme activity, they used that of standardised enzyme acid phosphatase, and found that the activity was only 10% of the expected value. One day, the enzyme activity of purified cell fractions which had been refrigerated for five days was measured. Surprisingly, the enzyme activity was increased to normal of that of the fresh sample. The result was the same no matter how many times they repeated the estimation, and led to the conclusion that a membrane-like barrier limited the accessibility of the enzyme to its substrate, and that the enzymes were able to diffuse after a few days (and react with their substrate). They described this membrane-like barrier as a \\"saclike structure surrounded by a membrane and containing acid phosphatase.\\"[10]\\r\\nIt became clear that this enzyme from the cell fraction came from a membranous fractions, which were definitely cell organelles, and in 1955 De Duve named them \\"lysosomes\\" to reflect their digestive properties.[11] The same year, Alex B. Novikoff from the University of Vermont visited de Duve's laboratory, and successfully obtained the first electron micrographs of the new organelle. Using a staining method for acid phosphatase, de Duve and Novikoff confirmed the location of the hydrolytic enzymes of lysosomes using light and electron microscopic studies.[12][13] de Duve won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974 for this discovery.\\r\\nOriginally, De Duve had termed the organelles the \\"suicide bags\\" or \\"suicide sacs\\" of the cells, for their hypothesized role in apoptosis.[14] However, it has since been concluded that they only play a minor role in cell death.[15]\\r\\nLysosomes contain a variety of enzymes, enabling the cell to break down various biomolecules it engulfs, including peptides, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. The enzymes responsible for this hydrolysis require an acidic environment for optimal activity.\\r\\nIn addition to being able to break down polymers, lysosomes are capable of fusing with other organelles & digesting large structures or cellular debris; through cooperation with phagosomes, they are able to conduct autophagy, clearing out damaged structures. Similarly, they are able to break-down virus particles or bacteria in phagocytosis of macrophages.\\r\\nThe size of lysosomes varies from 0.1 m to 1.2 m.[16] With a pH ranging from 4.5 to 5.0, the interior of the lysosomes is acidic compared to the slightly basic cytosol (pH 7.2). The lysosomal membrane protects the cytosol, and therefore the rest of the cell, from the degradative enzymes within the lysosome. The cell is additionally protected from any lysosomal acid hydrolases that drain into the cytosol, as these enzymes are pH-sensitive and do not function well or at all in the alkaline environment of the cytosol. This ensures that cytosolic molecules and organelles are not destroyed in case there is leakage of the hydrolytic enzymes from the lysosome.\\r\\nThe lysosome maintains its pH differential by pumping in protons (H+ ions) from the cytosol across the membrane via proton pumps and chloride ion channels. Vacuolar H+-ATPases are responsible for transport of protons, while the counter transport of chloride ions is performed by ClC-7 Cl?/H+ antiporter. In this way a steady acidic environment is maintained.[17][18]\\r\\nIt sources its versatile capacity for degradation by import of enzymes with specificity for different substrates; cathepsins are the major class of hydrolytic enzymes, while lysosomal alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is responsible for carbohydrates, and ACP2 is necessary to release phosphate groups of phospholipids.\\r\\nMany components of animal cells are recycled by transferring them inside or embedded in sections of membrane. For instance, in endocytosis (more specifically, macropinocytosis), a portion of the cell's plasma membrane pinches off to form a vesicle that will eventually fuse with an organelle within the cell. Without active replenishment, the plasma membrane would continuously decrease in size. It is thought that lysosomes participate in this dynamic membrane exchange system and are formed by a gradual maturation process from endosomes.[19][20]\\r\\nThe production of lysosomal proteins suggests one method of lysosome sustainment. Lysosomal protein genes are transcribed in the nucleus. mRNA transcripts exit the nucleus into the cytosol, where they are translated by ribosomes. The nascent peptide chains are translocated into the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they are modified. Upon exiting the endoplasmic reticulum and entering the Golgi apparatus via vesicular transport, a specific lysosomal tag, mannose 6-phosphate, is added to the peptides. The presence of these tags allow for binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors in the Golgi apparatus, a phenomenon that is crucial for proper packaging into vesicles destined for the lysosomal system.[21]\\r\\nUpon leaving the Golgi apparatus, the lysosomal enzyme-filled vesicle fuses with a late endosome, a relatively acidic organelle with an approximate pH of 5.5. This acidic environment causes dissociation of the lysosomal enzymes from the mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The enzymes are packed into vesicles for further transport to established lysosomes.[21] The late endosome itself can eventually grow into a mature lysosome, as evidenced by the transport of endosomal membrane components from the lysosomes back to the endosomes.[19]\\r\\nAs the endpoint of endocytosis, the lysosome also acts as a safeguard in preventing pathogens from being able to reach the cytoplasm before being degraded. Pathogens often hijack endocytotic pathways such as pinocytosis in order to gain entry into the cell. The lysosome prevents easy entry into the cell by hydrolyzing the biomolecules of pathogens necessary for their replication strategies; reduced Lysosomal activity results in an increase in viral infectivity, including HIV.[22] In addition, AB5 toxins such as cholera hijack the endosomal pathway while evading lysosomal degradation.[22]\\r\\nLysosomes are responsible for a group of genetically inherited disorders called lysosomal storage diseases (LSD). They are a type of inborn errors of metabolism caused by malfunction of one of the enzymes. The rate of incidence is estimated to be 1 in 5,000 live births, and the true figure expected to be higher as many cases are likely to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The primary cause is deficiency of an acidic hydrolase (a hydrolase which functions best in acidic environments). Other conditions are due to defects in lysosomal membrane proteins that fail to transport the enzyme, non-enzymatic soluble lysosomal proteins. The initial effect of such disorders is accumulation of specific macromolecules or monomeric compounds inside the endosomalÿautophagicÿlysosomal system.[8] This results in abnormal signaling pathways, calcium homeostasis, lipid biosynthesis and degradation and intracellular trafficking, ultimately leading to pathogenetic disorders. The organs most affected are brain, viscera, bone and cartilage.[23][24]\\r\\nThere is no direct medical treatment to cure LSDs.[25] The most common LSD is Gaucher's disease, which is due to deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Consequently, the enzyme substrate, the fatty acid glucosylceramide accumulates, particularly in white blood cells, which in turn affects spleen, liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bone marrow. The disease is characterized by bruises, fatigue, anaemia, low blood platelets, osteoporosis, and enlargement of the liver and spleen.[26][27]\\r\\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy is another lysosomal storage disease that also affects sphingolipid metabolism.\\r\\nWeak bases with lipophilic properties accumulate in acidic intracellular compartments like lysosomes. While the plasma and lysosomal membranes are permeable for neutral and uncharged species of weak bases, the charged protonated species of weak bases do not permeate biomembranes and accumulate within lysosomes. The concentration within lysosomes may reach levels 100 to 1000 fold higher than extracellular concentrations. This phenomenon is called \\"lysosomotropism\\"[28] or \\"acid trapping\\". The amount of accumulation of lysosomotropic compounds may be estimated using a cell-based mathematical model.[29]\\r\\nA significant part of the clinically approved drugs are lipophilic weak bases with lysosomotropic properties. This explains a number of pharmacological properties of these drugs, such as high tissue-to-blood concentration gradients or long tissue elimination half-lifes; these properties have been found for drugs such as haloperidol,[30] levomepromazine,[31] and amantadine.[32] However, high tissue concentrations and long elimination half-lives are explained also by lipophilicity and absorption of drugs to fatty tissue structures. Important lysosomal enzymes, such as acid sphingomyelinase, may be inhibited by lysosomally accumulated drugs.[33][34] Such compounds are termed FIASMAs (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase)[35] and include for example fluoxetine, sertraline, or amitriptyline.\\r\\nAmbroxol is a lysosomotropic drug of clinical use to treat conditions of productive cough for its mucolytic action. Ambroxol triggers the exocytosis of lysosomes via neutralization of lysosomal pH and calcium release from acidic calcium stores.[36] Presumably for this reason, Ambroxol was also found to improve cellular function in some disease of lysosomal origin such as Parkinson's or lysosomal storage disease.[37][38]\\r\\nBy scientific convention, the term lysosome is applied to those vesicular organelles only in animals, and vacuoles to plants, fungi and algae. Discoveries in plant cells since the 1970s started to challenge this definition. Plant vacuoles are found to be much more diverse in structure and function than previously thought.[39][40] Some vacuoles contain their own hydrolytic enzymes and perform the classic lysosomal activity, which is autophagy.[41][42][43] These vacuoles are therefore seen as fulfilling the role of the animal lysosome. Based on de Duve's description that \\"only when considered as part of a system involved directly or indirectly in intracellular digestion does the term lysosome describe a physiological unit\\", some botanists strongly argued that these vacuoles are lysosomes.[44] However, this is not universally accepted as the vacuoles are strictly not similar to lysosomes, such as in their specific enzymes and lack of phagocytic functions.[45] Vacuoles do not have catabolic activity and do not undergo exocytosis as lysosomes do.[46]\\r\\nThe word lysosome (/?la?so?so?m/, /?la?z?zo?m/) is New Latin that uses the combining forms lyso- (referring to lysis and derived from the Latin lysis, meaning \\"to loosen\\", via Ancient Greek ?? [l~sis]), and -some, from soma, \\"body\\", yielding \\"body that lyses\\" or \\"lytic body\\". The adjectival form is lysosomal. The forms *lyosome and *lyosomal are much rarer; they use the lyo- form of the prefix but are often treated by readers and editors as mere unthinking replications of typos, which has no doubt been true as often as not.","input":"What reactions are performed by hydrolytic enzymes in the lysosome?"},{"output":"over 90","context":"Bella Italia (formerly known as Bella Pasta) is a chain of over 90 restaurants offering dishes inspired by Italian cuisine in the United Kingdom.[1] The chain is part of the Casual Dining Group, who also own Caf Rouge and Las Iguanas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBella Italia started life as two small restaurant chains - Pastificio and Pizzaland - which were part of the Grand Metropolitan group.[2]\\r\\nIn 1990, Michael Guthrie (former Chairman of Mecca Leisure Group) formed BrightReasons and bought the Pizzaland and Pastificio chains from Grand Metropolitan for S20m in February 1991, rebranding Pastificio to Bella Pasta in the process.[3]\\r\\nIn February 1993, BrightReasons purchased 43 Pizza Piazza and Prima Pasta restaurants from Rank Organisation for S20.25m,[4] bringing their total number of restaurants to 165.\\r\\nIn May 1994, BrightReasons started preparing for a stock market flotation, and the group was expected to be valued at between S70m-S100m.[5] This was subsequently announced in September,[6] however, in November 1994, the planned flotation was postponed.[7]\\r\\nIn November 1996, BrightReasons was put up for sale[8] after suffering a particularly tough trading period in 1995.[9]\\r\\nIn December 2002, the Bella Pasta chain was rebranded as Bella Italia and the first fully branded restaurant opened in Leeds.\\r\\nIn September 2012, Bella Italia joined the Nectar loyalty card reward scheme as a redemption partner.[10]\\r\\nIn September 2013, Bella Italia began a partnership with the Gourmet Society, offering their members discounts on production of a Gourmet Society restaurant discount card.\\r\\nThe menu combines pizza and pasta, which is their main product, with a range of grill and speciality dishes.[11][12][13] The food is complemented by some Italian wines - many from smaller producers - beers and soft drinks.[12][14]\\r\\nIn 2009 the company was found to be threatening to dismiss waiting staff who do not get customers to pay tips on credit cards rather than in cash.

Several studies, as well as expert consensus indicates that the normal resting adult heart rate is probably closer to a range between 50 and 90 bpm.[3][4][5][6] During sleep a slow heartbeat with rates around 40ÿ50 bpm is common and is considered normal. When the heart is not beating in a regular pattern, this is referred to as an arrhythmia. Abnormalities of heart rate sometimes indicate disease.[7]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile heart rhythm is regulated entirely by the sinoatrial node under normal conditions, heart rate is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic input to the sinoatrial node. The accelerans nerve provides sympathetic input to the heart by releasing norepinephrine onto the cells of the sinoatrial node (SA node), and the vagus nerve provides parasympathetic input to the heart by releasing acetylcholine onto sinoatrial node cells. Therefore, stimulation of the accelerans nerve increases heart rate, while stimulation of the vagus nerve decreases it.[8]\\r\\nDue to individuals having a constant blood volume, one of the physiological ways to deliver more oxygen to an organ is to increase heart rate to permit blood to pass by the organ more often.[7] Normal resting heart rates range from 60ÿ100 bpm. Bradycardia is defined as a resting heart rate below 60 bpm. However, heart rates from 50 to 60 bpm are common among healthy people and do not necessarily require special attention. Tachycardia is defined as a resting heart rate above 100 bpm, though persistent rest rates between 80ÿ100 bpm, mainly if they are present during sleep, may be signs of hyperthyroidism or anemia (see below).[7]\\r\\nThere are many ways in which the heart rate speeds up or slows down. Most involve stimulant-like endorphins and hormones being released in the brain, many of which are those that are 'forced'/'enticed' out by the ingestion and processing of drugs.\\r\\nThis section discusses target heart rates for healthy persons and are inappropriately high for most persons with coronary artery disease.[9]\\r\\nThe heart rate is rhythmically generated by the sinoatrial node. It is also influenced by central factors through sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves.[10] Nervous influence over the heartrate is centralized within the two paired cardiovascular centres of the medulla oblongata. The cardioaccelerator regions stimulate activity via sympathetic stimulation of the cardioaccelerator nerves, and the cardioinhibitory centers decrease heart activity via parasympathetic stimulation as one component of the vagus nerve. During rest, both centers provide slight stimulation to the heart, contributing to autonomic tone. This is a similar concept to tone in skeletal muscles. Normally, vagal stimulation predominates as, left unregulated, the SA node would initiate a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm.[11]\\r\\nBoth sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli flow through the paired cardiac plexus near the base of the heart. The cardioaccelerator center also sends additional fibers, forming the cardiac nerves via sympathetic ganglia (the cervical ganglia plus superior thoracic ganglia T1ÿT4) to both the SA and AV nodes, plus additional fibers to the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heartrate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions.[11]\\r\\nNorepinephrine binds to the betaÿ1 receptor. High blood pressure medications are used to block these receptors and so reduce the heart rate.[11]\\r\\nParasympathetic stimulation originates from the cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches to both the SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than this, it becomes evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with one foot on the brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove ones foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.[11]\\r\\nThe cardiovascular centres receive input from a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function, via cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity results in increased rates of firing by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. The cardiovascular centres monitor these increased rates of firing, suppressing parasympathetic stimulation or increasing sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.[11]\\r\\nSimilarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, including pulmonary vessels and the right side of the heart itself. Rates of firing from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the rate of baroreceptor firing increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the rate of baroreceptor firing decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.[11]\\r\\nThere is a similar reflex, called the atrial reflex or Bainbridge reflex, associated with varying rates of blood flow to the atria. Increased venous return stretches the walls of the atria where specialized baroreceptors are located. However, as the atrial baroreceptors increase their rate of firing and as they stretch due to the increased blood pressure, the cardiac center responds by increasing sympathetic stimulation and inhibiting parasympathetic stimulation to increase HR. The opposite is also true.[11]\\r\\nIncreased metabolic byproducts associated with increased activity, such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and lactic acid, plus falling oxygen levels, are detected by a suite of chemoreceptors innervated by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. These chemoreceptors provide feedback to the cardiovascular centers about the need for increased or decreased blood flow, based on the relative levels of these substances.[11]\\r\\nThe limbic system can also significantly impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, it is not unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those of heart attacks. These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with ones eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.[11]\\r\\nUsing a combination of autorhythmicity and innervation, the cardiovascular center is able to provide relatively precise control over the heart rate, but other factors can impact on this. These include hormones, notably epinephrine, norepinephrine, and thyroid hormones; levels of various ions including calcium, potassium, and sodium; body temperature; hypoxia; and pH balance.[11]\\r\\nThe catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, secreted by the adrenal medulla form one component of the extended fight-or-flight mechanism. The other component is sympathetic stimulation. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar effects: binding to the beta-1 adrenergic receptors, and opening sodium and calcium ion chemical- or ligand-gated channels. The rate of depolarization is increased by this additional influx of positively charged ions, so the threshold is reached more quickly and the period of repolarization is shortened. However, massive releases of these hormones coupled with sympathetic stimulation may actually lead to arrhythmias. There is no parasympathetic stimulation to the adrenal medulla.[11]\\r\\nIn general, increased levels of the thyroid hormones (thyroxine(T4) and triiodothyronine (T3)), increase the heart rate; excessive levels can trigger tachycardia. The impact of thyroid hormones is typically of a much longer duration than that of the catecholamines. The physiologically active form of triiodothyronine, has been shown to directly enter cardiomyocytes and alter activity at the level of the genome.[clarification needed] It also impacts the beta adrenergic response similar to epinephrine and norepinephrine.[11]\\r\\nCalcium ion levels greatly impact on heartrate and contractility; increased levels cause an increase in both. High levels of calcium ions result in (hypercalcemia) and excessive levels can induce cardiac arrest. Drugs known as calcium channel blockers slow HR by binding to these channels and blocking or slowing the inward movement of calcium ions.[11]\\r\\nCaffeine and nicotine are both stimulants of the nervous system and of the cardiac centres causing an increased heart rate. Caffeine works by increasing the rates of depolarization at the SA node, whereas nicotine stimulates the activity of the sympathetic neurons that deliver impulses to the heart.[11] Both stimulants are legal and unregulated, and are known to be very addictive.[11]\\r\\nBoth surprise and stress induce physiological response: elevate heart rate substantially.[12] In a study conducted on 8 female and male student actors ages 18 to 25, their reaction to an unforeseen occurrence (the cause of stress) during a performance was observed in terms of heart rate. In the data collected, there was a noticeable trend between the location of actors (onstage and offstage) and their elevation in heart rate in response to stress; the actors present offstage reacted to the stressor immediately, demonstrated by their immediate elevation in heart the minute the unexpected event occurred, but the actors present onstage at the time of the stressor reacted in the following 5 minute period (demonstrated by their increasingly elevated heart rate). This trend regarding stress and heart rate is supported by previous studies; negative emotion/stimulus has a prolonged effect on heart rate in individuals who are directly impacted.[13] In regard to the characters present onstage, a reduced startle response has been associated with a passive defense, and the diminished initial heart rate response has been predicted to have a greater tendency to dissociation.[14] Further, note that heart rate is an accurate measure of stress and the startle response which can be easily observed to determine the effects of certain stressors.\\r\\nThe heart rate can be slowed by altered sodium and potassium levels, hypoxia, acidosis, alkalosis, and hypothermia. The relationship between electrolytes and HR is complex, but maintaining electrolyte balance is critical to the normal wave of depolarization. Of the two ions, potassium has the greater clinical significance. Initially, both hyponatremia (low sodium levels) and hypernatremia (high sodium levels) may lead to tachycardia. Severely high hypernatremia may lead to fibrillation, which may cause CO to cease. Severe hyponatremia leads to both bradycardia and other arrhythmias. Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) also leads to arrhythmias, whereas hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) causes the heart to become weak and flaccid, and ultimately to fail.[11]\\r\\nHeart muscle relies exclusively on aerobic metabolism for energy. Hypoxia (an insufficient supply of oxygen) leads to decreasing HRs, since metabolic reactions fueling heart contraction are restricted.[11]\\r\\nAcidosis is a condition in which excess hydrogen ions are present, and the patients blood expresses a low pH value. Alkalosis is a condition in which there are too few hydrogen ions, and the patients blood has an elevated pH. Normal blood pH falls in the range of 7.35ÿ7.45, so a number lower than this range represents acidosis and a higher number represents alkalosis. Enzymes, being the regulators or catalysts of virtually all biochemical reactions - are sensitive to pH and will change shape slightly with values outside their normal range. These variations in pH and accompanying slight physical changes to the active site on the enzyme decrease the rate of formation of the enzyme-substrate complex, subsequently decreasing the rate of many enzymatic reactions, which can have complex effects on HR. Severe changes in pH will lead to denaturation of the enzyme.[11]\\r\\nThe last variable is body temperature. Elevated body temperature is called hyperthermia, and suppressed body temperature is called hypothermia. Slight hyperthermia results in increasing HR and strength of contraction. Hypothermia slows the rate and strength of heart contractions. This distinct slowing of the heart is one component of the larger diving reflex that diverts blood to essential organs while submerged. If sufficiently chilled, the heart will stop beating, a technique that may be employed during open heart surgery. In this case, the patients blood is normally diverted to an artificial heart-lung machine to maintain the bodys blood supply and gas exchange until the surgery is complete, and sinus rhythm can be restored. Excessive hyperthermia and hypothermia will both result in death, as enzymes drive the body systems to cease normal function, beginning with the central nervous system.[11]\\r\\nHeart rate is not a stable value and it increases or decreases in response to the body's need in a way to maintain an equilibrium (basal metabolic rate) between requirement and delivery of oxygen and nutrients. The normal SA node firing rate is affected by autonomic nervous system activity: sympathetic stimulation increases and parasympathetic stimulation decreases the firing rate.[15] A number of different metrics are used to describe heart rate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basal or resting heart rate (HRrest) is defined as the heart rate when a person is awake, in a neutrally temperate environment, and has not been subject to any recent exertion or stimulation, such as stress or surprise. Most texts cite the typical resting heart rate in adults as 60ÿ100 beats per minute (bpm). A large body of evidence indicates that the normal range is actually 50-90 beats per minute. For example, all-cause mortality is increased by 1.22 (hazard ratio) when heart rate exceeds 90 beats per minute.[3] The mortality rate of patients with myocardial infarction increased from 15% to 41% if their admission heart rate was greater than 90 beats per minute.[4] ECG of 46,129 individuals with low risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that 96% had resting heart rates ranging from 48-98 beats per minute.[6] Finally, expert consensus reveals that 98% of cardiologists believe that the \\"60 to 100\\" range is too high, with a vast majority of them agreeing that 50 to 90 beats per minute is more appropriate.[5] The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node, where the faster pacemaker cells driving the self-generated rhythmic firing and responsible for the heart's autorhythmicity are located.[16] For endurance athletes at the elite level, it is not unusual to have a resting heart rate between 33 and 50 bpm.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe maximum heart rate (HRmax) is the highest heart rate an individual can achieve without severe problems through exercise stress,[17][unreliable medical source?][18] and generally decreases with age. Since HRmax varies by individual, the most accurate way of measuring any single person's HRmax is via a cardiac stress test. In this test, a person is subjected to controlled physiologic stress (generally by treadmill) while being monitored by an ECG. The intensity of exercise is periodically increased until certain changes in heart function are detected on the ECG monitor, at which point the subject is directed to stop. Typical duration of the test ranges ten to twenty minutes.\\r\\nAdults who are beginning a new exercise regimen are often advised to perform this test only in the presence of medical staff due to risks associated with high heart rates. For general purposes, a formula is often employed to estimate a person's maximum heart rate. However, these predictive formulas have been criticized as inaccurate because they generalized population-averages and usually focus on a person's age. It is well-established that there is a \\"poor relationship between maximal heart rate and age\\" and large standard deviations relative to predicted heart rates.[19] (see Limitations of Estimation Formulas).\\r\\nA number of formulas are used to estimate HRmax\\r\\nBased on measurements of 3320 healthy men and women aged between 19 and 89, and including the potential modifying effect of gender, body composition, and physical activity, Nes et al found\\r\\nThis relationship was found to hold substantially regardless of gender, physical activity status, maximal oxygen uptake, smoking, or body mass index. However, a standard error of the estimate of 10.8 beats/min must be accounted for when applying the formula to clinical settings, and the researchers concluded that actual measurement via a maximal test may be preferable whenever possible.[20]\\r\\nFrom Tanaka, Monahan, & Seals (2001):\\r\\nTheir meta-analysis (of 351?prior studies involving 492?groups and 18,712?subjects) and laboratory study (of 514?healthy subjects) concluded that, using this equation, HRmax was very strongly correlated to age (r = ?0.90). The regression equation that was obtained in the laboratory-based study (209 ? 0.7 x age), was virtually identical to that of the meta-study. The results showed HRmax to be independent of gender and independent of wide variations in habitual physical activity levels. This study found a standard deviation of ~10 beats per minute for individuals of any age, meaning the HRmax formula given has an accuracy of I20 beats per minute.[21]\\r\\nIn 2007, researchers at the Oakland University analyzed maximum heart rates of 132?individuals recorded yearly over 25 years, and produced a linear equation very similar to the Tanaka formula, HRmax = 206.9 ? (0.67 G age), and a nonlinear equation, HRmax = 191.5 ? (0.007 G age2). The linear equation had a confidence interval of I5ÿ8?bpm and the nonlinear equation had a tighter range of I2ÿ5?bpm. Also a third nonlinear equation was produced: HRmax = 163 + (1.16 G age) ? (0.018 G age2).[22][disputed (for: formulae conflict with source cited)? ÿ discuss]\\r\\nNotwithstanding the research of Tanaka, Monahan, & Seals, the most widely cited formula for HRmax (which contains no reference to any standard deviation) is still:\\r\\nAlthough attributed to various sources, it is widely thought to have been devised in 1970 by Dr. William Haskell and Dr. Samuel Fox.[23] Inquiry into the history of this formula reveals that it was not developed from original research, but resulted from observation based on data from approximately 11 references consisting of published research or unpublished scientific compilations.[24] It gained widespread use through being used by Polar Electro in its heart rate monitors,[23] which Dr. Haskell has \\"laughed about\\",[23] as the formula \\"was never supposed to be an absolute guide to rule people's training.\\"[23]\\r\\nWhile it is the most common (and easy to remember and calculate), this particular formula is not considered by reputable health and fitness professionals to be a good predictor of HRmax. Despite the widespread publication of this formula, research spanning two decades reveals its large inherent error, Sxy = 7ÿ11?bpm. Consequently, the estimation calculated by ? HRmax = 220 ? age ? has neither the accuracy nor the scientific merit for use in exercise physiology and related fields.[24]\\r\\nA 2002 study[24] of 43?different formulas for HRmax (including that of Haskell and Fox ÿ see above) published in the Journal of Exercise Psychology concluded that:\\r\\nResearch conducted at Northwestern University by Martha Gulati, et al., in 2010[25] suggested a maximum heart rate formula for women:\\r\\nA 2008 study from Lund, Sweden gives reference values (obtained during bicycle ergometry) for men:\\r\\nand for women:\\r\\n\\r\\nMaximum heart rates vary significantly between individuals.[23] Even within a single elite sports team, such as Olympic rowers in their 20s, maximum heart rates have been reported as varying from 160 to 220.[23] Such a variation would equate to a 60 or 90?year age gap in the linear equations above, and would seem to indicate the extreme variation about these average figures.\\r\\nFigures are generally considered averages, and depend greatly on individual physiology and fitness. For example, an endurance runner's rates will typically be lower due to the increased size of the heart required to support the exercise, while a sprinter's rates will be higher due to the improved response time and short duration. While each may have predicted heart rates of 180 (= 220 ? age), these two people could have actual HRmax 20?beats apart (e.g., 170-190).\\r\\nFurther, note that individuals of the same age, the same training, in the same sport, on the same team, can have actual HRmax 60?bpm apart (160ÿ220):[23] the range is extremely broad, and some say \\"The heart rate is probably the least important variable in comparing athletes.\\"[23]\\r\\nHeart rate reserve (HRreserve) is the difference between a person's measured or predicted maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is equivalent to percentage of VO2 reserve.[28]\\r\\nThis is often used to gauge exercise intensity (first used in 1957 by Karvonen).[29]\\r\\nKarvonen's study findings have been questioned, due to the following:\\r\\nFor healthy people, the Target Heart Rate or Training Heart Rate (THR) is a desired range of heart rate reached during aerobic exercise which enables one's heart and lungs to receive the most benefit from a workout. This theoretical range varies based mostly on age; however, a person's physical condition, sex, and previous training also are used in the calculation. Below are two ways to calculate one's THR. In each of these methods, there is an element called \\"intensity\\" which is expressed as a percentage. The THR can be calculated as a range of 65ÿ85% intensity. However, it is crucial to derive an accurate HRmax to ensure these calculations are meaningful.[citation needed]\\r\\nExample for someone with a HRmax of 180 (age 40, estimating HRmax As 220 ? age):\\r\\nThe Karvonen method factors in resting heart rate (HRrest) to calculate target heart rate (THR), using a range of 50ÿ85% intensity:[31]\\r\\nEquivalently,\\r\\nExample for someone with a HRmax of 180 and a HRrest of 70 (and therefore a HRreserve of 110):\\r\\nAn alternative to the Karvonen method is the Zoladz method, which derives exercise zones by subtracting values from HRmax:\\r\\nExample for someone with a HRmax of 180:\\r\\nHeart rate recovery (HRrecovery) is the reduction in heart rate at peak exercise and the rate as measured after a cool-down period of fixed duration.[32] A greater reduction in heart rate after exercise during the reference period is associated with a higher level of cardiac fitness.[33]\\r\\nHeart rates that do not drop by more than 12 bpm one minute after stopping exercise are associated with an increased risk of death.[32] Investigators of the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study, which included 5,000 subjects, found that patients with an abnormal HRrecovery (defined as a decrease of 42 beats per minutes or less at two minutes post-exercise) had a mortality rate 2.5 times greater than patients with a normal recovery.[33] Another study by Nishime et al. and featuring 9,454 patients followed for a median period of 5.2 years found a four-fold increase in mortality in subjects with an abnormal HRrecovery (P12 bpm reduction one minute after the cessation of exercise).[33] Shetler et al. studied 2,193 patients for thirteen years and found that a HRrecovery of P22 bpm after two minutes \\"best identified high-risk patients\\".[33] They also found that while HRrecovery had significant prognostic value it had no diagnostic value.[33]\\r\\nThe human heart beats more than 3.5 billion times in an average lifetime.\\r\\nThe heartbeat of a human embryo begins at approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community. The electrical depolarizations that trigger cardiac myocytes to contract arise spontaneously within the myocyte itself. The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads to the rest of the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the atrioventricular node respectively. Conductive cells develop the bundle of His and carry the depolarization into the lower heart.\\r\\nThe human heart begins beating at a rate near the mothers, about 75-80 beats per minute (BPM). The embryonic heart rate then accelerates linearly for the first month of beating, peaking at 165-185 BPM during the early 7th week, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 BPM per day, or about 10 BPM every three days, an increase of 100 BPM in the first month.[34]\\r\\nAfter peaking at about 9.2 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 150 BPM (+/-25 BPM) during the 15th week after the LMP. After the 15th week the deceleration slows reaching an average rate of about 145 (+/-25 BPM) BPM at term. The regression formula which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25?mm in crown-rump length or 9.2 LMP weeks is:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA\\r\\ng\\r\\ne\\r\\n?\\r\\ni\\r\\nn\\r\\n?\\r\\nd\\r\\na\\r\\ny\\r\\ns\\r\\n\\r\\n=\\r\\n?\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\nH\\r\\nR\\r\\n\\r\\n(\\r\\n0.3\\r\\n)\\r\\n+\\r\\n6\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathrm {Age\\\\ in\\\\ days} =\\\\ \\\\mathrm {EHR} (0.3)+6}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no difference in male and female heart rates before birth.[35]\\r\\nHeart rate is measured by finding the pulse of the heart. This pulse rate can be found at any point on the body where the artery's pulsation is transmitted to the surface by pressuring it with the index and middle fingers; often it is compressed against an underlying structure like bone. (A good area is on the neck, under the corner of the jaw.) The thumb should not be used for measuring another person's heart rate, as its strong pulse may interfere with the correct perception of the target pulse.\\r\\nThe radial artery is the easiest to use to check the heart rate. However, in emergency situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one beat to another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is not strong enough to be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.[36][37]\\r\\nPossible points for measuring the heart rate are:\\r\\nA more precise method of determining heart rate involves the use of an electrocardiograph, or ECG (also abbreviated EKG). An ECG generates a pattern based on electrical activity of the heart, which closely follows heart function. Continuous ECG monitoring is routinely done in many clinical settings, especially in critical care medicine. On the ECG, instantaneous heart rate is calculated using the R wave-to-R wave (RR) interval and multiplying/dividing in order to derive heart rate in heartbeats/min. Multiple methods exist:\\r\\nHeart rate monitors allow measurements to be taken continuously and can be used during exercise when manual measurement would be difficult or impossible (such as when the hands are being used). Various commercial heart rate monitors are also available. Some monitors, used during sport, consist of a chest strap with electrodes. The signal is transmitted to a wrist receiver for display.\\r\\nAlternative methods of measurement include pulse oximetry and seismocardiography.[38]\\r\\nTachycardia is a resting heart rate more than 100 beats per minute. This number can vary as smaller people and children have faster heart rates than average adults.\\r\\nPhysiological conditions where tachycardia occurs:\\r\\nPathological conditions where tachycardia occurs:\\r\\nBradycardia was defined as a heart rate less than 60 beats per minute when textbooks asserted that the normal range for heart rates was 60ÿ100 BPM. The normal range has since been revised in textbooks to 50ÿ90 BPM for a human at total rest. Setting a lower threshold for bradycardia prevents misclassification of fit individuals as having a pathologic heart rate. The normal heart rate number can vary as children and adolescents tend to have faster heart rates than average adults. Bradycardia may be associated with medical conditions such as hypothyroidism.\\r\\nTrained athletes tend to have slow resting heart rates, and resting bradycardia in athletes should not be considered abnormal if the individual has no symptoms associated with it. For example, Miguel Indurain, a Spanish cyclist and five time Tour de France winner, had a resting heart rate of 28 beats per minute,[39] one of the lowest ever recorded in a healthy human. Daniel Green achieved the world record for the slowest heartbeat in a healthy human with a heart rate of just 26 bpm in 2014.[40]\\r\\nArrhythmias are abnormalities of the heart rate and rhythm (sometimes felt as palpitations). They can be divided into two broad categories: fast and slow heart rates. Some cause few or minimal symptoms. Others produce more serious symptoms of lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.\\r\\nA number of investigations indicate that faster resting heart rate has emerged as a new risk factor for mortality in homeothermic mammals, particularly cardiovascular mortality in human beings. Faster heart rate may accompany increased production of inflammation molecules and increased production of reactive oxygen species in cardiovascular system, in addition to increased mechanical stress to the heart. There is a correlation between increased resting rate and cardiovascular risk. This is not seen to be \\"using an allotment of heart beats\\" but rather an increased risk to the system from the increased rate.[41]\\r\\nAn Australian-led international study of patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate is a key indicator for the risk of heart attack. The study, published in The Lancet (September 2008) studied 11,000 people, across 33 countries, who were being treated for heart problems. Those patients whose heart rate was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence of heart attacks, hospital admissions and the need for surgery. Higher heart rate is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.[42]\\r\\nOther studies have shown that a high resting heart rate is associated with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease.[43] A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy[44] and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure,[45] independent of level of physical fitness.[46] Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate has been shown to be associated with a 10ÿ20% increase in risk of death.[47] In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death.[45] Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase.[44]\\r\\nGiven these data, heart rate should be considered in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, even in apparently healthy individuals.[48] Heart rate has many advantages as a clinical parameter: It is inexpensive and quick to measure and is easily understandable.[49] Although the accepted limits of heart rate are between 60 and 100 beats per minute, this was based for convenience on the scale of the squares on electrocardiogram paper; a better definition of normal sinus heart rate may be between 50 and 90 beats per minute.[50]\\r\\nStandard textbooks of physiology and medicine mention that heart rate (HR) is readily calculated from the ECG as follows:\\r\\nLifestyle and pharmacological regimens may be beneficial to those with high resting heart rates.[47] Exercise is one possible measure to take when an individual's heart rate is higher than 80 beats per minute.[49][51] Diet has also been found to be beneficial in lowering resting heart rate: In studies of resting heart rate and risk of death and cardiac complications on patients with type 2 diabetes, legumes were found to lower resting heart rate.[52] This is thought to occur because in addition to the direct beneficial effects of legumes, they also displace animal proteins in the diet, which are higher in saturated fat and cholesterol.[52]\\r\\nA very slow heart rate (bradycardia) may be associated with heart block.[medical citation needed] It may also arise from autonomous nervous system impairment.[medical citation needed]","input":"What is the average heart rate of a healthy person?"},{"output":"the 1770s","context":"The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean[1] or the Austral Ocean,[2][note 4] comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60?S latitude and encircling Antarctica.[6] As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean.[7] This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters.\\r\\nBy way of his voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), this situation has no scientific sense since it has different ecosystem and life from the three oceans mentioned before and is located on a southern portion of Earth, hence the name of an ocean.[8] This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBorders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), the precusor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of 60S in its year 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses over other areas of the text, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002 and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the US Central Intelligence Agency[7] and Merriam-Webster.[note 5][10] Australian authorities regard the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia.[11][12] The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean,[2] depicting it (if at all) in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and on line maps.[13][note 6] Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps[15] and GeoNova.[16]\\r\\n\\"Southern Ocean\\" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco N~?ez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north.[17] The \\"South Seas\\" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to \\"the Western and Southern Ocean of America\\".[18]\\r\\nAuthors using \\"Southern Ocean\\" to name the waters encircling the unknown southern polar regions used varying limits. James Cook's account of his second voyage implies New Caledonia borders it.[19] Peacock's 1795 Geographical Dictionary said it lay \\"to the southward of America and Africa\\";[20] John Payne in 1796 used 40 degrees as the northern limit;[21] the 1827 Edinburgh Gazetteer used 50 degrees.[22] The Family Magazine in 1835 divided the \\"Great Southern Ocean\\" into the \\"Southern Ocean\\" and the \\"Antarctick [sic] Ocean\\" along the Antarctic Circle, with the northern limit of the Southern Ocean being lines joining Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land and the south of New Zealand.[23]\\r\\nThe United Kingdom's South Australia Act 1834 described the waters forming the southern limit of the new colony of South Australia as \\"the Southern Ocean\\". The Colony of Victoria's Legislative Council Act of 1881 delimited part of the division of Bairnsdale as \\"along the New South Wales boundary to the Southern ocean\\".[24]\\r\\nIn the 1928 first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits: Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and Broughton Island, New Zealand to the north.\\r\\nThe detailed land-limits used were from Cape Horn in South America eastwards to Cape Agulhas in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria, then southwards across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the South East Cape and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn.[25]\\r\\nThe northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas. From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses.\\r\\nIn the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115E), and extended to latitude 55S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67W).[26]\\r\\nAs is discussed in more detail below (see section on '2002 delineation'), prior to the 2002 (draft) edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The Great Australian Bight was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters (as designated in 1928) but was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans (for example to compare surface areas) it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition and a note in the publication read:\\r\\nThe Antarctic or Southern Ocean has been omitted from this publication as the majority of opinions received since the issue of the 2nd Edition in 1937 are to the effect that there exists no real justification for applying the term Ocean to this body of water, the northern limits of which are difficult to lay down owing to their seasonal change. The limits of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans have therefore been extended South to the Antarctic Continent.\\r\\nHydrographic Offices who issue separate publications dealing with this area are therefore left to decide their own northern limits (Great Britain uses Latitude of 55 South.)\\r\\nInstead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards.[27]\\r\\nThe IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at 60S (with no land interruptions at this latitude), with the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly 50S, but a few for as far north as 35S.\\r\\nA draft fourth edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the \\"2000 edition\\" as it summarized the progress to 2000).[29] It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world ÿ primarily the Sea of Japan naming dispute ÿ and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed.[30] A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits.[31] Effectively, the 3rd edition (which did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices) has yet to be superseded.\\r\\nDespite this, the 4th edition definition has partial de facto usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook uses \\"Southern Ocean\\" but none of the other new sea names within the \\"Southern Ocean\\" such as \\"Cosmonauts Sea\\") and Merriam-Webster,[7][10][14] scientists and nations ÿ and even by some within the IHO.[32] Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55S parallel for example.[27] Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, the Encyclop?dia Britannica describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the Antarctic Convergence, yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica.[12][33]\\r\\nOther sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean.[14]\\r\\nIn Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60s elsewhere.[34] Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern Ocean,[35] while Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.[36]\\r\\nA radical shift from past IHO practices (1928ÿ1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA World Fact Book) which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is.\\r\\nThe new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean.\\r\\nExploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australisa vast continent in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africawhich had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis, reaching as far as New Guinea.[37][38]\\r\\nEuropean geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries.\\r\\nThe Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla, who claimed having sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64 S in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time.\\r\\nIn 1606, Pedro Fernndez de Quir܇s took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\".\\r\\nFrancis Drake, like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, Abel Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent.\\r\\nThe visit to South Georgia by Anthony de la Roch in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence i.e. in the Southern Ocean / Antarctic.[39][40] Soon after the voyage cartographers started to depict Roch Island, honouring the discoverer. James Cook was aware of la Roch's discovery when surveying and mapping the island in 1775.[41]\\r\\nEdmond Halley's voyage in HMS Paramour for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52?S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140?mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" ÿ described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" ÿ resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 5410?S, and in the navigation of 48 of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55?S in 1730 .\\r\\nIn 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent.\\" He lighted upon a land in 50?S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him.[42]\\r\\nThe obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58?S, and then 30 eastward for the most part south of 60?S, a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached 67 15' S by 39 35' E, where their course was stopped by ice.\\r\\nCook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10 too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in 61 52 S by 95?E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60?S to 147?E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60?S by 177?W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching 67 31 S to stand north again in 135?W.\\r\\nA long detour to 47 50 S served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at 109 30 W before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at 71 10 S by 106 54 W. This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53 and 57?S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55 and 60. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value.[42]\\r\\nVoyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did.\\r\\nIn a voyage from 1822 to 1824, James Weddell commanded the 160-ton brig Jane, accompanied by his second ship Beaufoy captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where sealing proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached latitude 7415'?S and longitude 3416'45?W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to Coat's Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea) but Weddell decided to turn back.[44]\\r\\nThe first land south of the parallel 60 south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain.\\r\\nIn the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship San Telmo sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island (South Shetlands). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands.\\r\\nThe first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,[45][46][47] three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the British navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached a point within 32?km (20?mi) from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at 692128S 21450W? / ?69.35778S 2.24722W? / -69.35778; -2.24722[48] that became known as the Fimbul ice shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle.\\r\\nIn December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838ÿ42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called \\"the Wilkes Expedition\\"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the sloops-of-war USS?Vincennes and USS?Peacock , the brig USS?Porpoise , the full-rigged ship Relief, and two schooners Sea Gull and USS?Flying Fish . They sailed into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery \\"of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands\\" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was later named \\"Wilkes Land\\", a name it maintains to this day.\\r\\nExplorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: HMS Erebus and Terror.[49]\\r\\nThe Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914, led by Ernest Shackleton, set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, the Endurance, was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called James Caird, and then trekked over South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken.\\r\\nIn 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called Operation Highjump. Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given.\\r\\nCaptain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947ÿ1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.[50] The expedition explored and mapped large parts of Palmer Land and the Weddell Sea coastline, and identified the Ronne Ice Shelf, named by Ronne after his wife Edith \\"Jackie\\" Ronne.[51] Ronne covered 3,600 miles by ski and dog sledmore than any other explorer in history.[52] The Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition discovered and mapped the last unknown coastline in the world and was the first Antarctic expedition to ever include women.[53]\\r\\nThe Antarctic Treaty was signed on 1 December 1959 and came into force on 23 June 1961. Among other provisions, this treaty limits military activity in the Antarctic to the support of scientific research.\\r\\nThe first person to sail single-handed to Antarctica was the New Zealander David Henry Lewis, in 1972, in a 10-metre steel sloop Ice Bird.\\r\\nA baby, named Emilio Marcos de Palma, was born near Hope Bay on 7 January 1978, becoming the first baby born on the continent. He also was born further south than anyone in history.[54]\\r\\nThe MS Explorer was a cruise ship operated by the Swedish explorer Lars-Eric Lindblad. Observers point to the Explorer's 1969 expeditionary cruise to Antarctica as the frontrunner for today's sea-based tourism in that region.[55][56] The Explorer was the first cruise ship used specifically to sail the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean and the first to sink there[57] when she struck an unidentified submerged object on 23 November 2007, reported to be ice, which caused a 10 by 4 inches (25 by 10?cm) gash in the hull.[58] The Explorer was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time.[59] The Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62 24 South, 57 16 West,[60] in roughly 600?m of water.[61]\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\\r\\nWith a northern limit at 60S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans.\\r\\nOne reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean has typical depths of between 4,000 and 5,000?m (13,000 and 16,000?ft) over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of 7,236?m (23,740?ft) occurs at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench, at 6000'S, 024W. The Antarctic continental shelf appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to 800?m (2,600?ft), compared to a global mean of 133?m (436?ft).\\r\\nEquinox to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of 2.6?million square kilometres (1.0G10^6?sq?mi) in March to about 18.8?million square kilometres (7.3G10^6?sq?mi) in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area.\\r\\nSub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as \\"seas\\", \\"straits\\", \\"bays\\", \\"channels\\", and \\"gulfs\\". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication Limits of Oceans and Seas. In clockwise order these include (with IHO sub-division chartlet numbers in parenthesis) the Weddell Sea (10.1), the Lazarev Sea (10.2), the Riiser-Larsen Sea (10.3), the Cosmonauts Sea (10.4), the Cooperation Sea (10.5), the Davis Sea (10.6), Tryoshnikova Gulf (10.6.1), the Mawson Sea (10.7), the Dumont D'Urville Sea (10.8), the Somov Sea (10.9), the Ross Sea (10.10), McMurdo Sound (10.10.1), the Amundsen Sea (10.11), the Bellingshausen Sea (10.12), part of the Drake Passage (10.13), Bransfield Strait (10.14) and part of the Scotia Sea (4.2).[29][note 7][note 8] A number of these such as the 2002 Russian-proposed \\"Consmonauts Sea\\", \\"Cooperation Sea\\", and \\"Somov (mid-1950s Russian polar explorer) Sea\\" are not included in the 1953 IHO document which remains currently in force,[27] because they received their names largely originated from 1962 onward. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World, but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do.[62][63]\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, oil and gas fields on the continental margin. Placer deposits, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\nManganese nodules are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s.[6]\\r\\nThe icebergs that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough fresh water to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested.[64]\\r\\nIcebergs can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances.\\r\\nSailors know latitudes from 40 to 70 degrees south as the \\"Roaring Forties\\", \\"Furious Fifties\\" and \\"Shrieking Sixties\\" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.\\r\\nThe Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward  chasing and joining itself, and at 21,000?km (13,000?mi) in length  it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting 130?million cubic metres per second (4.6G10^9?cu?ft/s) of water ÿ 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers.\\r\\nSeveral processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of water masses not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. One of these is the Antarctic Bottom Water, a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under sea ice.\\r\\nAssociated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species.[65]\\r\\nThe Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean.[6]\\r\\nLarge-scale upwelling is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations.\\r\\nSome models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur.\\r\\nThe Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf.\\r\\nSea ice has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre.[66] There is some evidence that global warming has resulted in some decrease of the salinity of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s.[67]\\r\\nDue to the Coriolis effect acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.\\r\\nSea temperatures vary from about ?2 to 10?C (28 to 50 F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean-area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth.[68] In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.\\r\\nA variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adlie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.\\r\\nThe Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a \\"true seal\\", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds.[69]\\r\\nThe benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in 1 square metre (10.8?sq?ft). As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Deep-sea gigantism is common among these animals.[70]\\r\\nA census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,000?km (7,456?mi). Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution ÿ fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5?C, and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages.[71]\\r\\nThe rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns.[72] The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands.[73]\\r\\nThe flightless penguins are all located in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands.[74] Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.[75]\\r\\nThere are very few species of fish in the Southern Ocean. The Channichthyidae family, also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack hemoglobin in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than 400 metres (1,312?ft) deep, but was overfished in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the water column eating plankton and smaller fish.[76]\\r\\nThere are two species from the Dissostichus genus, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species live on the seafloor 100ÿ3,000 metres (328ÿ9,843?ft) deep, and can grow to around 2 metres (7?ft) long weighing up to 100 kilograms (220?lb), living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Due to the low water temperatures around the mainland, the Antarctic toothfish has antifreeze proteins in its blood and tissues. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.[76]\\r\\nAnother abundant fish group is the Notothenia genus, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.[76]\\r\\nSeven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to 4,000 kilograms (8,818?lb), while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only 150 kilograms (331?lb). These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.[77]\\r\\nThe four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals.[78] Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet.[79] The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range.[80] Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south.[81]\\r\\nThere are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), grows to 24 metres (79?ft) long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter.[82]\\r\\nFive species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, are found in the Southern Ocean.[83] The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is 6 centimetres (2.4?in) long and weighs over 1 gram (0.035?oz).[84] The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per 1 cubic metre (35?cu?ft), turning the water red.[83] Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival.[84] During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.[83]\\r\\nMany benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their young in a brood pouch. Glyptonotus antarcticus is an unusually large benthic isopod, reaching 20 centimetres (8?in) in length weighing 70 grams (2.47?oz). Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals.[70]\\r\\nSlow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing as large as a human hand. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed.[70]\\r\\nMany aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as Adamussium colbecki move around on the seafloor, while others such as Laternula elliptica live in burrows filtering the water above.[70] There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean, the largest of which is the giant squid (Architeuthis sp.), which at 15 metres (49?ft) is the largest invertebrate in the world. Squid makes up the entire diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.[85]\\r\\nThe sea urchin genus Abatus burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it.[70] Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai. Salpa thompsoni is found in ice-free areas, whereas Ihlea racovitzai is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.[86]\\r\\nAntarctic sponges are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.[87]\\r\\nIncreased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish.[88] Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.\\r\\nAll international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region:\\r\\nMany nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of mineral resources south of the fluctuating Antarctic Convergence,[91] which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south,[92] it prohibits new claims to Antarctica.[93]\\r\\nThe Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources applies to the area south of 60 South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.[94]\\r\\nBetween 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 tonnes, of which 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian toothfish. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998ÿ99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.\\r\\nMajor operational ports include: Rothera Station, Palmer Station, Villa Las Estrellas, Esperanza Base, Mawson Station, McMurdo Station, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica.\\r\\nFew ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require icebreaker escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers.\\r\\nThe Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at 7750S 16640E? / ?77.833S 166.667E? / -77.833; 166.667. Winter Quarters Bay forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of Ross Island where a floating ice pier makes port operations possible in summer. Operation Deep Freeze personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.[95]\\r\\nBased on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the Great Australian Bight is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of Tasmania would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of Albany, Thevenard, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Adelaide, Portland, Warrnambool, and Macquarie Harbour.\\r\\nYacht races have been held in the Southern Ocean, such as the Volvo Ocean Race, Velux 5 Oceans Race, Vende Globe, Jules Verne Trophy and Global Challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nCoordinates: 70S 150W? / ?70S 150W? / -70; -150","input":"When did the southern ocean become a thing?"},{"output":"March 17, 2005","context":"Missouri State University (MSU or MO State), formerly Southwest Missouri State University, is a public university located in Springfield, Missouri, United States. Founded in 1905 as the Fourth District Normal School, it is the state's second largest university campus by enrollment, with an official enrollment of 23,537 in the fall 2016 semester.[7] The Springfield campus is one of two degree-granting institutions operated by the school, the other being a two-year campus in West Plains, Missouri. A bachelor of science in business from MSU is offered at the Missouri State University Branch Campus Dalian in China. In addition to its main campus, MSU maintains a fruit research station in Mountain Grove and the Department of Defense and Strategic Studies program housed in Fairfax, Virginia.[8] The school is classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education as one of six master's colleges and universities in Missouri.[9] In the 2014 U.S. News and World Report, the school was ranked 68th in the category Midwestern regional universities.[10]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMissouri State University was formed as the Fourth District Normal School, by legislative action on March 17, 1905. Like other normal schools of the day, the school's primary purpose was the preparation of teachers for the public school system.\\r\\nClasses began on June 11, 1906 with the first class totaling 543 students in an off-campus facility. The first permanent campus building was Academic Hall. Its cornerstone was laid on August 10, 1907 and construction was completed in January 1909. The building is now known as Carrington Hall, named after William T. Carrington, the first president of the State Normal School. It serves as the University's administrative center.\\r\\nThe Fourth District Normal School became Southwest Missouri State Teacher's College in 1919 to reflect its regional and academic emphasis. Throughout the interwar period, the College's programs expanded to include liberal arts and sciences in the curriculum, thus facilitating a name change to Southwest Missouri State College in 1945. A burgeoning student population throughout the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the establishment of residence halls, accompanied by a growth in post-graduate studies. This led to a third name change in 1972, to Southwest Missouri State University. In 1973, enrollment surpassed 10,000 students for the first time.[11]\\r\\nBy 1985, SMSU had grown into the second-largest public university in the state, leading administrators to support a bill to change the name to Missouri State University, which eventually died in committee in the Missouri General Assembly. In 1990, enrollment surpassed 20,000 students for the first time, but further attempts to rename the school throughout the 1990s and early 2000s also failed. However, the state legislature did grant the university a statewide mission in Public Affairs in 1995.\\r\\nIn 2004, with the election of Springfield native Matt Blunt to the governorship and the approaching centennial of the university's founding, new support developed for the name change. It was opposed by the University of Missouri System (which operates the four campuses of the University of Missouri), which feared that the name change would lead to duplication of academic programs and ongoing battles for students and state funding. In 2005 the name-change bill was passed, following a late-night compromise between University of Missouri System President Elson Floyd and then-Southwest Missouri State President John Keiser, stating that Missouri State University would not duplicate certain professional programs offered by the University of Missouri. The bill to rename the University finally passed the Missouri Senate (25ÿ7). On March 1, 2005, after more than seven hours of debate, the bill passed the Missouri House (120ÿ35). Governor Blunt signed it into law on March 17, 2005the centennial anniversary of the Universityat the Plaster Student Union where several student leaders and state leaders were present.\\r\\nPresidents of the college include:[12]\\r\\nMissouri State University's academic divisions include:\\r\\nThe University offers more than 150 undergraduate majors and over 45 graduate programs. For the 2009 fiscal year the University awarded 4,093 degrees.[15] The Springfield campus had 721 full-time instructional faculty in fall 2009, of which 46 percent were female and 60 percent were tenured. The student-faculty ration is 20-to-1.[16] Nearly 90 percent of full-time ranked faculty members have the most advanced degree available in their field.[16] During its 2009 fiscal year, MSU received 196 grants totalling $20,901,035. Freshmen entering for the fall 2010 semester had an average ACT score of 24.1 (well above both the state and national averages[17]) and a high school grade point average of 3.60.[18]\\r\\nThe MSU College of Business is the largest college of business in Missouri and one of the largest in the Midwest.[19] Missouri States COB is housed in David D. Glass Hall, a 4-story, 185,000-square-foot (17,200?m2) state-of-the-art building. Glass Hall is named in honor of MSU alumnus and former Wal-Mart CEO David Glass.[20] Not only has the COB received the highest level of accreditation available, but all programs in the College of Business are fully accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Among colleges and universities in the nation offering business degrees, only 10 percent have been granted this status.[21] The College of Business underwent a major renovation in 2016 to update the building and provide more space for academic activities.\\r\\nMSU reported the typical annual cost of attendance for the 2012-13 academic year as $14,996 for Missouri residents and $21,342 for non-residents. This included tuition and required student fees of $6,792 for residents and $13,138 for non-residents, $7,204 for room and board, and $1,000 estimated for books and supplies.[22] These costs reflected action taken on March 30, 2012, by the MSU Board of Governors to increase tuition by approximately 3% ($6.48 per credit hour) for in-state undergraduates. Out-of-state undergraduate tuition was also increased by $24 per credit hour, and a $25-per-credit-hour fee for upper-level courses in the business school was initiated.[23]\\r\\nIn June 2000, Missouri State University entered into an agreement with Liaoning Normal University of the People's Republic of China to establish the Missouri State Branch Campus Dailan (LNU-MSU College of International Business) on the campus of LNU. As an educational cooperation project between the two universities, the Branch Campus received formal approval from the governing bodies of both universities, the Missouri State Board of Governors and the Bureau of Education of Liaoning Province, China.[24]\\r\\nMissouri State University has a statewide mission in public affairs granted by the state legislature in 1995.[25] The mission is stated as having three broad themes: Ethical Leadership, Cultural Competence and Community Engagement. The goal of the Ethical Leadership component has been articulated by MSU as \\"students will articulate their value systems, act ethically within the context of a democratic society, and demonstrate engaged and principled leadership.\\" The stated objective of the Cultural Competence component is \\"students will recognize and respect multiple perspectives and cultures.\\" Two goals have been articulated for the Community Engagement portion of the mission. They are that \\"students will recognize the importance of contributing their knowledge and experiences to their own community and the broader society\\" and \\"students will recognize the importance of scientific principles in the generation of sound public policy.\\"[26] The public affairs mission is emphasized and enhanced by designated Public Affairs Professorships and a Provost Fellow for Public Affairs, special scholarship programs, grant program, Excellence in Community Service Awards, a yearly week-long Missouri Public Affairs Academy for high school students, a campus-wide public affairs emphasis week and the annual MSU Public Affairs Conference which brings together a diverse group of speakers and panelist for public discussions of various aspects of the public affairs mission. Past conference speakers have included Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Nawal El Saadawi, Les Garland, John Edwards and Frances Hesselbein.\\r\\nStudents at Missouri State University have the opportunity to spend as little as a week or as much as an entire academic year studying abroad while receiving academic credit. The Study Away Programs Office, located in the Jim D. Morris Center, has partnerships with several program providers and direct exchange agreements that allow students to go more or less anywhere in the world. Students at Missouri State University are encouraged to learn more about Study Away opportunities by dropping by the Study Away Office, checking out the Study Away webpage, or attending a Study Away 101 Information Session.[27]\\r\\nMissouri State Universitys main campus, containing over 40 buildings, is located on 225 acres (91.1?ha) in central Springfield. National Avenue forms the eastern boundary, with South Holland and Kimbrough Avenues to the west, Cherry and Elm Streets to the north, and Grand Street to the south. John Q. Hammons Parkway bisects the campus, running north and south. The campus contains a variety of architectural styles, with the oldest buildings exhibiting a Neoclassical style and newer buildings displaying a mix of Modern styles including International, Brutalist, Bauhaus and High-tech, unified through the use of light-colored stone and concrete exterior materials.\\r\\nFacing National Avenue is the \\"Historic Quadrangle,\\" containing Carrington Hall (1908), Hill Hall (1923) and Siceluff Hall (1927), as well as Cheek Hall (1955) and Ellis Hall (1959). South of that area is Pummill Hall (1957), Karls Hall (1958) and Craig Hall (1967), which contains the Coger Theater and is the site of an annual outdoor summer tent theatre program.\\r\\nIn the center of campus is the Duane G. Meyer Library, constructed in 1980 and named after a former president of the University. It contains over 877,000 books, subscriptions to over 3,500 periodicals and newspapers with back issues on microfilm, microfiche, and microcard, and full text electronic access to over 20,000 periodicals. In addition, the library contains over 934,000 state, federal and United Nations government documents. The Meyer Library was renovated and expanded in 2002, and included the addition of the Jane A. Meyer Carillon, one of only 164 such instruments in the United States. In front of Meyer Library is the five-level, multi-jet John Q. Hammons Fountain (named for the MSU alumnus and hotel developer).\\r\\nOther major academic buildings are located south and west of the Meyer Library. These include Temple Hall (1971), Kemper Hall (1976), Glass Hall (1988) and Strong Hall (1998). The majority of the north side of the campus is dedicated to student residences and recreational areas; however, Greenwood Laboratory School, a fully functioning K-12 school, is also located in this area.\\r\\nThe Jane A. Meyer Carillon is located in the center of the Missouri State University campus, at the southwest corner of the Duane G. Meyer Library. At 140 feet (43?m) tall, it is the tallest carillon in the Midwestern United States and serves as a campus icon and focal point. It was dedicated on April 13, 2002. The total weight of the 48 bronze bells and cast-iron clappers is 32,000 pounds, with the largest bell weighing 5,894 pounds, or nearly three tons. The complete carillon and its supporting tower structure weighs 2.5 million pounds. Funds for the purchase of the bells and keyboard and for the construction of the tower were provided by Ken and Jane Meyer, longtime friends of the University and supporters of the arts. Jane Meyer was a former organ student of the MSU Department of Music. The carillons 48 bronze bells, cast-iron clappers and keyboard were purchased from and installed by Royal Eijsbouts, a prestigious bell making firm from the Netherlands. The carillon plays the standard Westminster chime sequence every 15 minutes, with the first of the hourly bells marking the exact start of each hour. The department of music also coordinates and presents special concerts throughout the year.\\r\\nJuanita K. Hammons Hall for the Performing Arts is a 2,220-seat center located in the northwest corner of the campus. Juanita K. (as referred to by locals) not only hosts the University's music, dance and theatre department performances, it is home to the Springfield Symphony Orchestra. It is the Springfield areas major performance hall and presents a regular schedule of national touring companies and prominent individual performers. The hall includes multi-level boxes and moveable orchestra pit; spacious backstage facilities with individual, crew and chorus dressing rooms, cast lounge, green room, loading dock and break areas; an expansive multi-level lobby; public and private reception areas; full-service front-of-house, technical and support staff offices; an on-site computerized box office; and a 5-level parking garage adjacent to the building.[28]\\r\\nSoutheast of Meyer Library is the Robert W. Plaster Sports Complex. Originally built in 1930, the athletic field became the stadium in 1941 and was known for many years as Briggs Stadium in honor of Coach A. W. Briggs, longtime head of Missouri State's athletic department. In 2014, the stadium was converted to a football-specific field surface and other renovations were made for a more intimate fan experience. The playing surface was replaced and moved closer to the west grand stand. In addition, the student side (east side) was fully replaced from the ground up and includes game day locker rooms, a new scoreboard and a party platform called \\"The Clif\\".[29] The facility was renamed after a major expansion and renovation in the 1980s that included installation of an artificial playing surface, an all-weather track, a second level of seating, twelve racquetball courts, men's and women's locker rooms, five classrooms, and a fitness center. Immediately north of Plaster Sports Complex is McDonald Arena, built by WPA labor in 1940. It served as the university's central indoor arena until construction of the John Q. Hammons Student Center on the campus' north-west edge in 1976. That venue was in turn replaced as the primary indoor sporting venue by construction of the adjacent 11,000-seat JQH Arena in 2008.\\r\\nIDEA Commons (short for Innovation, Design, Entrepreneurship, and Art) is an urban research park in Downtown Springfield that blends together residential, retail and entertainment facilities supported by various university programs. Currently the Jordan Valley Innovation Center (JVIC) and \\"Brick City\\" are located within the IDEA Commons. The JVIC is a Missouri State University research center providing \\"hands-on\\" learning and experience for students, as well as support and business opportunities for affiliated businesses. Within the JVIC are three operating units: The Center for Applied Science and Engineering (CASE), The Center for Biomedical and Life Sciences (CBLS), and Springfield Innovation, Inc. (SI2). The JVIC is located in the former Missouri Farmers Association milling facility. Brick City, located at 305 West Mill Street, was renovated for the Fall 2008 semester to house several elements of the MSU Art and Design department. Missouri State University won the University Economic Development Associations (UEDA) 2009 Award of Excellence for their work on IDEA Commons at the UEDA annual symposium. MSUs IDEA Commons beat 34 other institutions, including two other finalists, North Carolina State University and the University of Memphis, for the award.[30]\\r\\nThe Darr Agricultural Center is located on 90 acres (36.4?ha) near the intersection of Kansas Expressway and Sunshine Street in southwest Springfield. The Darr Center serves as a laboratory and field experience classroom for the study of livestock management, equine studies, horticulture, agronomy, animal science, and wildlife conservation and management. Improvements in 2007 included extensive renovation of the main arena, as well as the addition of a stalling barn, a multi-use barn, office space, bovine and equine handling facilities, a research laboratory, a classroom, and a two-bedroom apartment for graduate student housing.[31] In 2010 MSU announced a $6.5 Million expansion of the facility to include construction of a new Learning Center with a large classroom and lecture hall equipped with an animal entrance and specialized pen; classrooms with distance learning technology; and laboratories to facilitate research in the areas of water quality, soil chemistry, horticultural sciences, animal physiology and more. The building will also include a conference space and a 400-person capacity banquet hall available for public and private events. The new facility is to be LEED Silver certified, incorporating sustainability features such as site filtering of storm water runoff, occupancy sensors that control lighting and temperature, use of natural light, and ground source heat-pump systems.[32]\\r\\nOurPromise is Missouri State Universitys newest capital campaign. The goal is to raise a total of $125 million allocated as $20 million for student scholarships, $15 million for faculty endowments, $40 million for enhancement for programs/community engagement, $1.5 million investment in the West Plains campus, and $48.5 million for facilities.

The Fight Song is sung after every home football touchdown. The traditional alumni song of Missouri State is performed at every commencement ceremony and sometimes played at athletic events or other ceremonies.\\r\\nThe traditions of school colors and the school mascot were established during the 1906 school year, before the first permanent building (Carrington Hall) was even constructed. A joint committee of faculty and students decided on the colors of maroon and white to represent the University. The same committee also selected the Bear as the official school mascot, basing their choice on the design of the state seal of Missouri. The colors and mascots are reflected on the school seal.[47]\\r\\nChinese MBA program: In 2011 the university's executive M.B.A.program for students from China came under scrutiny after an article in the Springfield News-Leader questioned the financial relationship between Missouri State and its Hong Kong-based agent, alleging that students were paying double the amount that MSU was receiving. The executive M.B.A. program accepts cohorts of students who come through a sponsor: a provincial or municipal government agency, a university, or a corporation. Missouri State's agent, the International Management Education Corporation (IMEC), identifies and develops relationships with sponsors, who identify and prepare students, screening them for work experience, a minimum grade-point average at the undergraduate level (2.75) and English language proficiency. IMEC then provides MSU with a cohort of a minimum of 30 students, and the sponsors send MSU the students' applications for review. The fees students pay vary by sponsor and range from $15,000 to $22,000. IMEC was contracted to pay Missouri State between $10,103 and $11,886 per student; resulting in between 20 and 55 percent of the student fee being retained by IMEC. IMEC defended the fees claiming they cover marketing/promotion/recruiting and the related overhead costs as well as additional costs including intensive English training, exams, advice on applications and documentations, visa application fees and service and orientations provided by IMEC. University officials defended the program and arrangement stating that it had allowed Missouri State to quickly grow the executive M.B.A. program without having to spend university resources recruiting and marketing overseas. The program has had 370 students since it started in 2007. However, the chair of the Faculty Senate said professors have periodically raised questions about the quality and oversight of the various China initiatives, and had prepared a list of questions for the president in light of the article, expressing a desire to ensure that proper oversight was in place to avoid compromising quality.[48] Following translation and re-publication of information from the News-Leader article by Chinese newspapers, MSU reported that it received calls from several program sponsor organizations in China that they would no longer participate in the program. The university continued to defend the program, arguing that mistranslations of the article had provided an incorrect view of the program's academic rigor and stating that it intended to meet with sponsors and answer any questions about the program.[49]\\r\\nNon-discrimination on basis of sexual orientation: In 2006, the university modified its nondiscrimination policy to include sexual orientation as an officially protected status. The addition reads: \\"... the University does not discriminate on any basis (including, but not limited to, political affiliation and sexual orientation) not related to the applicable educational requirements for students or the applicable job requirements for employees.\\" Former University president John Keiser had firmly opposed the change as did the Student Government Association during 2004 when Student Body President Chris Curtis moved to change the SGA constitution to mirror the university's. However, the policy was quietly changed on September 18, 2006 during a meeting held for the first time outside of Springfield in St. Louis. It is generally believed this move was to avoid the mostly conservative citizens of Springfield and add this policy \\"under the radar\\" of the critics of the change.[50] Missouri Governor Matt Blunt quickly released criticism of the policy change calling it \\"unnecessary and bad;\\" also saying the decision \\"bows to the forces of political correctness\\".[51]\\r\\nGrading policy: Missouri State University converted to a plus or minus grading system instead of the standard A, B, C, D and F system starting with the Fall 2009 term. Individual professors can decide whether to use this grading system in their classes. Under the new grading scale, a C? will not qualify as a passing grade for courses requiring a C or better.[52]\\r\\nTobacco-free campus: Citing the proven detrimental health effects of tobacco use, effective August 15, 2010, Missouri State University enacted a policy further restricting the use of tobacco products on the campus. Smoking is allowed only at designated smoking areas outside JQH Arena, Plaster Stadium, Hammons Student Center, and Juanita K. Hammons Hall during performances or events, and inside of private vehicles located on University parking lots. The use of smokeless tobacco is prohibited at all locations on campus.[53]","input":"When did southwest missouri state became missouri state?"},{"output":"Yousef Abdelky","context":"Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque (Arabic: ???? ????? ???? ???????) is located in Abu Dhabi, the capital city of the United Arab Emirates.[1] The largest mosque in the country, it is the key place of worship for Friday gathering and Eid prayers.

The weight of this carpet is 35 ton and is predominantly made from wool (originating from New Zealand and Iran). There are 2,268,000,000 knots within the carpet and it took approximately two years to complete.[1]\\r\\nThe Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque has seven imported chandeliers from the company Faustig in Munich, Germany that incorporate millions of Swarovski crystals. The largest chandelier is the second largest known chandelier inside a mosque, the third largest in the world and has a 10?m (33?ft) diameter and a 15?m (49?ft) height.[1] The pools along the arcades reflect the mosque's spectacular columns, which becomes even more glorious at night.

It is about 1,600 kilometres (1,000?mi) from the coast of Africa and 2,250 kilometres (1,400?mi) from the coast of Brazil. It is governed as part of the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha,[2] of which the main island, Saint Helena, is around 1,300 kilometres (800?mi) to the southeast. The territory also includes the sparsely-populated Tristan da Cunha archipelago, some 3,730 kilometres (2,300?mi) to the south, about halfway to the Antarctic Circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island is named after the day of its recorded discovery, Ascension Day. It played a role as an important safe haven and coaling station to mariners and for commercial airliners during the days of international air travel by flying boats. During World War II it was an important naval and air station, especially providing antisubmarine warfare bases in the Battle of the Atlantic.[3] Ascension Island was garrisoned by the British Admiralty from 22 October 1815 to 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island is the location of RAF Ascension Island, which is a Royal Air Force station, a European Space Agency rocket tracking station, an Anglo-American signals intelligence facility and the BBC World Service Atlantic Relay Station. The island was used extensively as a staging point by the British military during the Falklands War. Ascension Island hosts one of four ground antennas (others are on Kwajalein Island, Diego Garcia, and Cape Canaveral) that assist in the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS) navigational system. NASA operates a Meter Class Autonomous Telescope (MCAT) on Ascension Island for tracking orbital debris, which is potentially hazardous to operating spacecraft and astronauts, at a facility called the John Africano NASA/AFRL Orbital Debris Observatory.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1501, the Portuguese navigator Afonso de Albuquerque sighted the island on Ascension Day (which fell on 21 May that year) and named it Ilha da Ascens?o after this feast day.[5] Dry and barren, the island had little appeal for passing ships except for collecting fresh meat, and was not claimed for the Portuguese Crown. Mariners could hunt for the numerous seabirds and the enormous female green turtles that laid their eggs on the sandy beaches. The Portuguese also introduced goats as a potential source of meat for future mariners.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 1701, HMS Roebuck, commanded by William Dampier, sank in the common anchoring spot in Clarence Bay to the northwest of the island. Sixty men survived for two months until they were rescued. Almost certainly, after a few days they found the strong water spring in the high interior of the island, in what is now called Breakneck Valley (there is a much smaller water source, lower on the mountain, which was named Dampier's Drip by people who probably misinterpreted Dampier's story).[6]\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible that the island was sometimes used[7] as an open prison for criminal mariners, although there is only one documented case of such an exile, a Dutch ship's officer, Leendert Hasenbosch, set ashore at Clarence Bay as a punishment for sodomy in May 1725.[citation needed] British mariners found the Dutchman's tent, belongings and diary in January 1726; the man's remains were not found. His diary was published in translation in London later that same year, under the title Sodomy Punish'd; it can nowadays be read online.[8]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganised settlement of Ascension Island began in 1815, when the British garrisoned it as a precaution after imprisoning Napoleon I on Saint Helena to the southeast.[5] Colonel Edward Nicolls was among those sent there, apparently as punishment for what the Crown perceived as excessive support for Seminole Indians during his posting on the future U.S. Gulf Coast during the War of 1812. On 22 October the Cruizer class brig-sloops Zenobia and Peruvian claimed the island for His Britannic Majesty King George III. The Royal Navy designated the island as a stone frigate, HMS Ascension, with the classification of \\"Sloop of War of the smaller class\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe location of the island made it a useful stopping-point for ships and communications. The Royal Navy used the island as a victualling station for ships, particularly those of the West Africa Squadron working against the slave trade.[9] A garrison of Royal Marines was based at Ascension from 1823.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1836 the Beagle voyage visited Ascension. Charles Darwin described it as an arid treeless island, with nothing growing near the coast. Sparse vegetation inland supported \\"about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows & horses\\", large numbers of guineafowl imported from the Cape Verde islands, rats, mice, and land crabs; he agreed with the saying attributed to the people of St Helena that \\"We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder\\". He noted the care taken to sustain \\"houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain\\", and cisterns at roadsides to provide drinking water. The springs were carefully managed, \\"so that a single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order.\\" In commenting on this, he noted Ren Primevre Lesson's remark \\"that the English nation alone would have thought of making the island of Ascension a productive spot; any other people would have held it as a mere fortress in the ocean.\\"[10]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1843, botanist and explorer Joseph Hooker visited the island. Four years later, Hooker, with much encouragement from Darwin, advised the Royal Navy that with the help of Kew Gardens, they should institute a long-term plan of shipping trees to Ascension. The planted trees would capture more rain and improve the soil, allowing the barren island to become a garden. So, from 1850 and continuing year on year, ships came with an assortment of plants from botanical gardens in Argentina, Europe and South Africa. By the late 1870s Norfolk pines, eucalyptus, bamboo, and banana trees grew in profusion at the highest point of the island, Green Mountain, creating a tropical cloud forest.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1899, the Eastern Telegraph Company installed the first underwater cable from the island, connecting the UK with its colonies in South Africa.[5] In 1922, letters patent made Ascension a dependency of Saint Helena.[5] The island was managed by the head of the Eastern Telegraph Company on the island until 1964 when the British Government appointed an Administrator to represent the Governor of Saint Helena on Ascension.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring World War II, to supply and augment extensive amphibious aircraft antisubmarine patrol operations ongoing from the early days of the war, the United States built an airbase on Ascension Island, known as \\"Wideawake\\",[5] after a nearby colony of sooty terns (locally called 'wideawake' birds because of their loud, distinctive constant (day-and-night) cawing chatter.[12] The airbase, which was under construction by the 38th Combat Engineer Battalion of the Army Corps of Engineers, was unexpectedly visited by two British Fairey Swordfish torpedo planes on 15 June 1942.[citation needed] According to one of the pilots, Peter Jinks, the planes were fired upon before being recognised as allies. The Swordfish had to land on the unfinished airstrip, thus becoming the first aircraft to land on Ascension Island proper? which had long served as an ASW base for Catalina (PBY Catalina) flying boats. The event was commemorated with a postage stamp 15 June 1982.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe airfield was used by the US military as a stopping point for American aircraft crossing the Atlantic Ocean on the way to theatres of operation in Europe and Africa. American bombers based at Wideawake were engaged in the Laconia incident. After the end of World War II, and American departure, the airbase fell into disuse.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only local military action during World War II occurred on 9 December 1941. At around mid-day, the German submarine?U-124 approached Georgetown on the surface with the intention of sinking any ships at anchor or shelling the cable station.[citation needed] Fort Bedford, a two-gun shore battery at Cross Hill, above Georgetown, fired on the submarine. The guns scored no hits but the U-boat submerged and retreated. The battery remains largely intact to this day, together with its guns, BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval guns removed from HMS?Hood during a refit in Malta in 1938.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Space Race and the Cold War, the Americans returned in 1956.[5] Wideawake Airfield expanded in the mid-1960s. The runway, with its strange hump, was extended, widened, and improved to allow its use by large aircraft, and later to act as an emergency runway for the Space Shuttle, although the Shuttle never had to use it.[5] At the time, it was the world's longest airport runway.[12] The United States Air Force used the island as part of its Eastern Range. NASA established a tracking station on the island in 1967, which it operated for more than 20 years before closing it down in 1990.[5] A joint Government Communications Headquarters and National Security Agency signals intercept station was also established on Ascension during the Cold War.[13][14] The island retains a role in space exploration: the European Space Agency now operates an Ariane monitoring facility there.[5] The BBC Atlantic Relay Station was installed in 1966 for short-wave broadcasts to Africa and South America.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1982 the British task force used Ascension Island as a staging post during the Falklands War. The Royal Air Force deployed a fleet of Vulcan bombers and Victor tankers at the airfield. Vulcans launched the opening shots of the British offensive from Ascension in Operation Black Buck. The RAF also used the base to supply the task force. Because of the increase in air traffic during the war, Wideawake, with up to 400 movements of all types each day, was one of the busiest airfields in the world for a short period.[15] The Royal Navy's fleet stopped at Ascension for refuelling on the way. Following the war, the British retained an increased presence on the island, establishing RAF Ascension Island, and providing a refuelling stop for the regular airlink between RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, and RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs of  2004[update], it was reported that the Composite Signals Organisation, an arm of GCHQ, continued to operate a signals interception facility at Cat Hill on Ascension.[16] As of  2007[update] NASA continued to list Ascension Island as a \\"downrange site\\" used for range safety instrumentation.[17] In particular, the Post-Detect Telemetry System used to acquire launch vehicle telemetry includes a station on Ascension.[18]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2008 British diplomats at the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UN CLCS), requested sovereignty over 77,220 square miles (200,000?km2) of submarine territory around the island. This would enable exploration into new reserves of oil, gas and minerals, though none are thought to exist.[19]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2016, the United States Department of Energy started operating a mobile climate research facility on the island.  It is operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility (ARM) near the South East Crater, south of the Green Mountain summit.  The field campaign requires the mobile facility to be operational for about 17 months, until October 2017.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main island has an area of approximately 88?km2. A volcanic peak rising from 100?km (62?mi) west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, much of the island is a wasteland of lava flows and cinder cones; forty-four distinct dormant craters have been identified.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension is a geologically young formation, the tip of an undersea volcano which rose above the waves only a million years ago. Although volcanic activity is mainly associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge plate boundary 80?km to the west, Ascension also displays some features which are commonly associated with hotspot volcanism. This appears to be the result of a smaller mantle plume that originally formed under the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, before the African plate, along with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge itself, drifted eastward ÿ leaving the (stationary) plume at its current location west of the ridge.[21] Its last eruption may have occurred in the sixteenth century. Due to its short above-water history, its soil consists mostly of clinker.[12]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island consists of a wide range of alkaline rocks atypical for oceanic islands, ranging from basalt through trachyandesite and trachyte to rhyolite.[21]\\r\\nAscension has a hot desert climate (BWh, according to the K?ppen climate classification). The temperatures at the coast average from 22.7 to 27.8?C (72.9 to 82.0?F), and about 5 to 6?C (9 to 11?F) cooler at the highest point. Rain showers may occur at any time during the year, but tend to be heavier between June and September. Although the island is in the tropical zone, average annual rainfall is very low. The cause of this might be the relatively low temperature of the ocean water, as the Benguela Current and South Equatorial Current flow northward west of Africa. These currents bring cooling effects around the eastern South Atlantic Ocean. Tropical cyclones also occur only rarely in the South Atlantic Ocean which might be caused by the same phenomenon, and by strong vertical wind shear.[22][23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe endemic flora includes plants like Pteris adscensionis, Asplenium ascensionis, Euphorbia origanoides as well as the extinct species Oldenlandia adscensionis, Sporobolus durus and Dryopteris ascensionis. Anogramma ascensionis (Ascension Island parsley fern) was thought to have become extinct due to habitat loss, until four plants were found on the island in 2010. Over 60 specimens were then successfully cultivated.[27] Portuguese explorers released goats in the 1500s which ate many species to extinction. The later introduction of rabbits, sheep, rats and donkeys, and over 200 imported species further marginalised the original flora.[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nBy 1843 the island was barren with few plants. However, due to the introduction of species by the British, Ascension Island's Green Mountain is now one of the few large-scale planned forests, and is gradually growing with each year. Its highest point is at 859?m.[9] Non-indigenous plants teem there, and the crown of Green Mountain is a lush halo of bamboo. Flanking one side is a large stand of tall Norfolk pine, trees planted by British mariners, which were to have been used as replacement masts for sailing ships. In June 2005 the first National Park on Ascension Island, the Green Mountain National Park, was opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsopis juliflora, a type of mesquite known as Mexican thorn, was introduced by BBC engineers to bind the dry top soil when they arrived in 1966 to construct a shortwave relay station. It has thrived on the barren lava of the island ÿ an estimated 38,000 bushes existed by 2016. Its spread has been destructive to other species, and current encroachment on the edges of beaches threatens those that use this space, such as the green turtle. Its hardy taproots can extend to 30 meters deep. Local authorities are considering means of controlling or eradicating it.[12][29]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA variety of mammals have been introduced: donkeys, sheep, cats and rats among others. Reptiles consist of two species of lizards. Endemic insect species include the minute, wingless Psocopteran Troglotroctes ashmolearum, that has been found in caves and between lava blocks.[30] In summer, flies are known to be a problem.\\r\\nThe largest native land animal is the land crab Johngarthia lagostoma (formerly Gecarcinus lagostoma).[31] Offshore, there is a variety of open-ocean fish, including sharks, wahoo, tuna, bonito, barracuda, marlin, blackfish and sailfish. The protected green turtle is perhaps the most notable of the endemic fauna, coming ashore to lay their eggs on the beaches from November to May. Turtles were regularly harvested until 1930, when the practice was banned. By 1970 the turtle population had begun to rebound.[12] From the 1970s, when records began, to 2014, green turtle nesting increased by 500%, resulting in some 24,000 nests being laid on the island's main beaches each year.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nOn land are found such non-native birds such as canaries, francolins, mynas, sparrows, and waxbills. Sooty terns or \\"wideawake birds\\" nest in great seashore lava \\"fairs\\". Other seabirds include some types of boobies, petrels, and tropicbirds (named boatswain, pronounced BO-sun birds, by the inhabitants of the island), white tern, brown noddy, black noddy and Ascension frigatebird. The Ascension crake became extinct around the beginning of the nineteenth century.[29]\\r\\n\\r\\nOff the east coast of Ascension is the islet of Boatswain Bird Island. It is a haven for sea birds providing refuge from the rats, cats and people that came to Ascension Island from Europe and Africa. Following a successful campaign headed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the main island was in 2006 declared free of feral cats, and sea birds are now once again nesting on Ascension Island.[33]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension Island, including fourteen inshore stacks and marine habitat extending out for three nautical miles from the coastline, has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds. Birds for which the IBA is significant include red-billed tropicbirds, Ascension frigatebirds (an endemic breeder), sooty terns and black noddies.[34] The island was formerly home to the endemic Ascension crake, but the species has been extinct since the early nineteenth century.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January 2016 the UK Government announced that an area around Ascension Island was to become a huge marine reserve, to protect its varied and unique ecosystem, including some of the largest marlin in the world, large populations of green turtle, and the island's own species of frigate bird. With an area of 234,291 square kilometres (90,460?sq?mi), slightly more than half of the reserve will be closed to fishing while the remainder will be policed thanks to a grant from the Louis Bacon Foundation. The reserve should be ready for formal designation by 2017.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension forms part of a British overseas territory together with Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha.[9] Executive authority is vested in Elizabeth II,[9] who is represented by the Governor of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. As the Governor resides in Jamestown, Saint Helena, an Administrator is appointed to represent the Governor on Ascension Island.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of changes in the constitutional arrangements for Ascension Island, the first Island Council of seven members was elected, and took office on 1 November 2002. This Council was dissolved by order of the Governor of Saint Helena on 24 October 2005, and a new election was held on 16 November 2005. 697 electors chose among ten candidates contesting the seven seats.[36]\\r\\n\\r\\nSix of the seven members resigned in January 2007 in the belief that they were \\"assisting to legitimise a democracy that doesn't really exist on Ascension Island\\".[37] The exact preceding quote and its citation does not exist as of  May?2018[update], but a memorandum sent by a group of Ascension Island residents suggests that the handling of economic development, taxation and representation led to the dispute and that all six councillors resigned (five of them at once). The memorandum states, \\"The elected Council has been used to legitimise an illegitimate system that has never been a true democracy and, it seems, was never intended to be.\\"[38] The counter-argument was that as the island has no indigenous population whatsoever, it is in an unusual political position.[citation needed] Consequently, a general election was called, but by the close of nominations, there were only two candidates.[38] The election was abandoned, and the governor suspended the Island Council for 12 months. It was stated that an election would take place in April 2008 but following consultations this was extended to October.[39] Eventually, candidates were elected to form a new Island Council, which was sworn in on 27 October 2008.[40][not in citation given][41]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension Island has its own local system of law, much of which is based on the laws of Saint Helena and some parts of English law with modifications.[9] The Island Council advises on new or revised laws. Where local legislation does not exist, Saint Helena law may be used where appropriate and suitable for local adaptation, or specific Ascension Island law is enacted. Employment legislation is a mixture of contract law and the Workmen's Protection Ordinance, which guarantees a contract, and obliges employers to provide free accommodation, medical cover, food (or a food allowance), and travel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 was made by HM the Queen and the Privy Council on 8 July and came into operation in September 2009.[9] The new constitution replaced the 1988 version and among other changes limited the Governor's powers, included a Bill of Rights, established independence of the judiciary and the public service, and designated the Governor of St Helena as, concurrently, the Governor for Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It ended the \\"dependency\\" status of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha on Saint Helena that had been in place, for administrative convenience, since 1922.[42]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the February 2016 census, 806 people were recorded living on Ascension Island, 556 from Saint Helena (nicknamed the \\"Saints\\"[43]) and 250 people of other nationalities.[1] RAF Ascension Island is made up of 17 staff.\\r\\nThere has never been an indigenous population on the island.[44]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are five settlements:\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, there are some cottages on Green Mountain, occasionally occupied by visitors, and the Residency, the official residence of the Administrator.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo enter Ascension Island, individuals need the Administrator's written permission. There is no permanent residence. A contract of employment is a requirement to stay on the island,[43] though short term visits by tourists are possible with prior approval. The British government has confirmed that there is no \\"right of abode\\" on Ascension Island.[45] As the local newspaper The Islander reported at the time,[46][47] it was raised by some former Council members and 4  expatriate employees that whilst it was agreed there was no right of abode, the authorities had previously indicated it would consider changing the law to allow the rights of abode and property purchase, but decided not to do so.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are Scouting and Guiding groups on Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Scouting was established on Ascension Island in November 1973,[49] having been established on St Helena island in 1912.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo Boats School is the only school on the island and provides education to all resident children aged 3ÿ16.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main economic activity on the island is centred on the military bases at Wideawake Airfield, and the BBC World Service's Atlantic Relay station. The Ministry of Defence estate and facilities are managed by the infrastructure support provider Interserve Defence. Serco runs the airport services and Sodexo provides catering and domestic facilities. A former feature of Ascension was a 70,000 tonne tanker permanently moored offshore that was operated by Maersk as a bulk fuel facility. In December 2002, this was replaced by an on-shore Petroleum Supply Depot under military management, with fuel still being delivered by a chartered tanker, the Maersk Rapier, which operates on an MOD resupply contract for both Ascension and the Falkland Islands every two months. Fuel for the island is transferred via a floating hose, which is connected to the on-shore depot at the island's pier head and to the ship at anchor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main export items are Ascension Island postage stamps, first issued in 1922, and, since 2010, commemorative coins (which are legal tender but non-circulating) and commercial fishing licences for long-line tuna fishing vessels operating to ICCAT quotas.\\r\\n\\r\\nA secondary export is the international internet domain code .ac, which small UK educational colleges and science museums are favouring due to its similarity to .ac.uk, the domain code reserved for well-established UK educational institutions. In December 2013, The Pirate Bay (one of the most well-known file piracy websites in the world) moved to .ac following the seizure of their .sx website.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil 2002, tourism was virtually non-existent because of the inaccessibility of the island to transport, the absence of guest accommodation and the need for a sponsor. Limited air travel has, however, been made available in recent years to the public by the RAF, and the Georgetown Obsidian Hotel and a number of guest cottages have been opened. All visitors are required to obtain an entry permit before travelling. Sport fishing is the main attraction for many of the visitors. The island also boasts what is sometimes called the worst golf course in the world.[50][51]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island hosts many communications and relay stations, exploiting its mid-Atlantic position. Both the BBC and Cable & Wireless Worldwide (owned by Vodafone since 2012[52]) have communications posts there. The European Space Agency (ESA) also has a tracking station on the island that tracks the Ariane 5 and the Soyuz rockets shortly after their launch from Kourou in French Guiana.\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension has one local radio station and one relayed from St. Helena. It also receives broadcasts from the British Forces Broadcasting Service and television services for the US military.[9]\\r\\n\\r\\nAscension Island has the international calling code +247 and, from 1 June 2015 has five digit numbers (the old four-digit number prefixed by the digit 6).[53]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe island provided a base for a NASA communications dish during the space race in the mid-twentieth century.[12] The island was chosen due to its central location in the Atlantic. Sites were chosen due to their proximity to orbital paths ÿ generally along the Equator.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Bank of St. Helena has a branch on the island; it holds an account with the UK's Lloyds Bank for the purposes of conducting money transfers with the rest of the world.[54] The currency on Ascension Island is the Saint Helena pound. Tristan da Cunha however uses the pound sterling rather than the Saint Helena pound. The coins of the Saint Helena pound specify that they are for use on both Saint Helena and Ascension Island, but with no mention of Tristan da Cunha. For more information on currency in the wider region, see Pound sterling in the South Atlantic and the Antarctic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2003 the British and US governments signed the Wideawake agreement designed to allow a limited number of non-scheduled civilian aircraft to land on Ascension Island, under responsibility of the British government.[55][56]\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor runway conditions at RAF Ascension Island led in April 2017 to the cancellation of twice-weekly flights from there to the UK (RAF Brize Norton) and to the Falkland Islands (RAF Mount Pleasant).\\r\\nAn Airbus A330 aircraft operated by AirTanker Services on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom) carried out those flights, called the South Atlantic Air Bridge, although a limited number of commercial passenger tickets were available. Those flights now travel via Cape Verde.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile A330s are for now unable to land at the airport, the United States military uses Air Transport International flying 757 \\"combi\\" jets to maintain a twice monthly flight between the island and Patrick Air Force Base in Florida for the use of its personnel only, while the (MV Ascension) supply ship regularly services US facilities.\\r\\n\\r\\nA C17 for the UK's MoD lands there at Ascension once a month for its own personnel.[57]\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no taxi service on the island and most visitors requiring transport hire a car. There are around 40 kilometres (25?mi) of roads on the island, all hard-surfaced.[9] Some of the surfacing used surplus tarmac from construction of the airstrip.[43] Traffic drives on the left.[43]","input":"What is the island between south africa and south america?"},{"output":"an action-adventure video game","context":"Grand Theft Auto (GTA) is an action-adventure video game series created by David Jones and Mike Dailly;[2] the later titles of which were created by brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by Rockstar Games. The name of the series references the term used in the US for motor vehicle theft.\\r\\nMost games in the series are set in fictional locales modelled on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami and the state of California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series focuses around many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3] With its British origin, the series contains satire and humour.[4]\\r\\nBritish video game developer DMA Design began the series in 1997. As of 2014[update], it has eleven stand-alone games and four expansion packs. The third chronological title, Grand Theft Auto III, is considered a landmark title, as it brought the series to a 3D setting and more immersive experience. Subsequent titles would follow and build upon the concept established in Grand Theft Auto III, and receive significant acclaim. They subsequently influenced many other open world action games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar games.\\r\\nThe series has been critically acclaimed and commercially successful, having shipped more than 250 million units,[5] making it the fourth-highest selling video game franchise of all time, behind Nintendo's Mario and Pokmon franchises,[6] and Tetris.[7] In 2006, Grand Theft Auto featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[8] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[4] However, the series has also gained controversy for its adult nature and violent themes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is split into separate fictional universes, named after the primary level of graphics capability used in each era.[9] The original Grand Theft Auto, its expansions and its sequel are considered the \\"2D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto III and its sequels are considered the \\"3D universe\\". Grand Theft Auto IV, its expansions and Grand Theft Auto V are considered the \\"HD universe\\". Each universe is considered separate with only brands, place names and background characters shared between them.[9]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto, the first game in the series, was released for Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS in October 1997, ported to the PlayStation in 1998 and the Game Boy Color in 1999. Grand Theft Auto 2 was released in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, later receiving ports on the PlayStation, Dreamcast and Game Boy Color.[13]\\r\\nThe PlayStation 2 also featured three instalments of the main series, all of which have been re-released on several platforms; a deal between Take-Two Interactive and Sony Computer Entertainment resulted in their timed exclusivity on the PlayStation 2, before receiving ports to Microsoft Windows and the Xbox.[14] The 2001 title Grand Theft Auto III moved away from the two-dimension (2D) graphics used in the first two games to three-dimension (3D) computer graphics; the game features polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds.[15] Grand Theft Auto: Vice City was published in 2002, and was the first to feature a speaking protagonist, voiced by Ray Liotta.[16] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, released in 2004, introduced various new elements, including character customisation and a large map encompassing three cities and surrounding rural area.[17]\\r\\nTwo main instalments were published for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The 2008 title Grand Theft Auto IV focused on realism and detail, removing various customisation features, while adding an online multiplayer mode.[18] Grand Theft Auto V, published in 2013, featured three playable protagonists.[19] It was released to massive financial success, breaking multiple records.[20] It was later re-released with various enhancements, in 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and in 2015 for Microsoft Windows.[21]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto has spawned numerous additional games and expansion packs. In 1999, the original game received two expansion packs: Grand Theft Auto: London 1969 and Grand Theft Auto: London 1961.[13] Grand Theft Auto Advance, released in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance, featured a top-down perspective. Three games were released for the PlayStation Portable. The 2005 game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto III, while the 2006 game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories is a prequel to Vice City; both games were later ported to the PlayStation 2. In 2009, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars was released for the Nintendo DS, and later ported to the PlayStation Portable.[22] In 2009, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony were released for the Xbox 360 as expansion packs to Grand Theft Auto IV; a \\"strategic alliance\\" between Rockstar and Microsoft resulted in the timed exclusivity. They were later released on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows as part of a compilation, titled Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City.[23]\\r\\nNumerous titles in the series have received ports to mobile devices. Chinatown Wars was released for iOS in 2010 and for Android and Fire OS in 2014.[24] For their tenth anniversaries, Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City were both re-released for iOS and Android in 2011 and 2012, respectively.[25][26] In 2013, San Andreas was ported to iOS, Android & Windows Phone and RT?;[27] the mobile port was later re-released for Xbox 360 in 2014, the year of the game's tenth anniversary.[28] In 2015 Liberty City Stories was ported to iOS, Android & Fire OS.[29][30]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto Double Pack was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. It includes Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City.[31] Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is a compilation of III, Vice City, and San Andreas. The compilation was first released in 2005 for the Xbox.[32] Later it was released for the PlayStation 2, Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 4.[33][34][35][36] The Trilogy also served as the revised package for San Andreas, which had to be pulled from shelves due to the controversial Hot Coffee mod.[37]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for Grand Theft Auto IV. It contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc. It was released on 29 October 2009 for the Xbox 360 and on 13 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3. Microsoft added Episodes from Liberty City to its backwards compatibility list for Xbox One platforms in February 2017.[38]\\r\\nThe series has been expanded into various other formats. Jacked: The Outlaw Story of Grand Theft Auto, a book written by David Kushner chronicling the development of the series, was published in 2012.[39] In March 2015, BBC Two announced The Gamechangers, a 90-minute docudrama based on the creation of Grand Theft Auto,[40] Directed by Owen Harris and written by James Wood, the drama stars Daniel Radcliffe as Rockstar president Sam Houser and Bill Paxton as disbarred attorney Jack Thompson.[41] In May 2015, Rockstar filed a lawsuit against the BBC for trademark infringement, stating that they had no involvement with the development of the film and had unsuccessfully tried to contact the BBC to resolve the matter.[42] It first aired on 15 September 2015 on BBC Two.[43]\\r\\nIn 2006, McFarland & Company published The Meaning and Culture of Grand Theft Auto.[44] Compiled by Nate Garrelts, the 264-page book is a collection of essays regarding the Grand Theft Auto series, to help audiences better understand the games and to make a point about due diligence of game criticism. The book is divided into two parts: the first part discusses the controversies surrounding the series, while the second half takes a theoretical look at the games absent of the controversy.[45]\\r\\nA planned film adaptation of the series is unable to proceed because of a lawsuit by Roger Corman, who produced Grand Theft Auto. In 2017, Corman said, \\"I actually sued the video game manufacturer who flat-out stole the idea. We settled out of court and they gave me some money. I retain the right to remake it, but the way it was actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy. My lawyers are actually studying that contract to make certain that I have a clear title to remake my picture, and I will remake Grand Theft Auto.\\"[46]\\r\\nEach game in this series allows players to take on the role of a criminal in the big city, typically an individual who plans to rise through the ranks of organised crime through the course of the game. The player is given various missions by kingpins and major idols in the city underworld which must be completed to progress through the storyline. Assassinations and other violent crimes are featured regularly. Occasionally taxi driving, firefighting, street racing, bus driving, or learning to fly helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are also involved in the game.\\r\\nIn later titles, notably those released after Grand Theft Auto 2, the player is given a more developed storyline in which they are forced to overcome an unfortunate event (e.g., being betrayed and left for dead), which serves as motivation for the character to advance up the criminal ladder and ultimately leads to the triumph of the character by the end of the storyline.\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series belongs to a genre of free-roaming role-playing video games called open world games, and grants a large amount of freedom to the player. Traditional action games are structured as a single track series of levels with linear gameplay, but in Grand Theft Auto the player can determine the missions that they want to undertake, and their relationship with various characters are changed based on these choices. Influenced by the earlier game Turbo Esprit,[47][48] the cities of the games can be roamed freely at any point in the game, and are examples of open world video game environments which offer accessible buildings with minor missions in addition to the main storyline. There are exceptions: missions follow a linear, overarching plot. These missions are required to complete in order to unlock new areas in the game.\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III and subsequent games have more voice acting and radio stations, which simulate driving to music with disc jockeys, radio personalities, commercials, talk radio, pop music, and American culture.\\r\\nThe use of vehicles in an explorable urban environment provides a basic simulation of a working city, complete with pedestrians who generally obey traffic signals. Further details are used to flesh out an open-ended atmosphere that has been used in several other games, such as The Simpsons: Hit & Run, which has less emphasis on crime or violence, and Lego City Undercover, which reverses the roles of police officer and criminal, although the player goes undercover in gangs for a portion of the game.\\r\\n Criminal activities in Grand Theft Auto games do not go unnoticed by the police. As the player engages in these in-game illegal activities, they may gain a \\"wanted level\\", represented by a maximum of five or six stars. A small crime, such as running over a non-player character, may create a one star wanted level situation, while shooting an officer may earn more stars. As the number of stars increase, the amount and strength of the response will increase; a single star might have a few police cars chase after the player, while at 5 or 6 stars, tanks and attack helicopters will chase down the player. Many in-game missions will automatically give the player a wanted level after completing a certain event which they must then get rid of before the mission is complete. Often, trying to keep away from the police while wanted will cause the player to gain even higher wanted levels. The player can remove their character's wanted level by avoiding detection or spending in-game money at specific locations to elude the police (such as a mod shop to repaint their car). Alternatively, if the player-character dies, they will respawn at a hospital and the wanted level will be removed, though the player may lose money, guns, and other benefits they had before being chased. The \\"wanted level\\" gameplay concept has become common in other GTA Clones and similar open-world games.\\r\\nThe Grand Theft Auto series is set in a fictional version of the world, in a number of different time periods. The original Grand Theft Auto introduced three main cities: Liberty City, based upon New York City, Vice City, based upon Miami, and San Andreas, based upon mostly parts of California. In the first Grand Theft Auto game, San Andreas was based on San Francisco and parts of Las Vegas. Expansion packs later set the game in London.\\r\\nThe second entry in the franchise, Grand Theft Auto 2, set the game in the future in a locale named \\"Anywhere City\\".\\r\\nSubsequent games in the series have re-imagined and expanded upon the original locales. Grand Theft Auto III is set in a different rendition of Liberty City only loosely based on New York City.[49] A revised Vice City and San Andreas are depicted in Vice City and San Andreas, respectively, the latter of which takes the form of an entire state, instead of a single city. The state of San Andreas is based on the states of California and Nevada, and consists of three major cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San Francisco), and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). Surrounding towns and areas of desert, water, woodland, and countryside lie between the three cities. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City is also briefly featured during one mission.\\r\\nLiberty City Stories and Vice City Stories, originally released on the PlayStation Portable handheld console and later reissued for other consoles, are set in the previous depictions of their respective eponymous cities, but in different decades. The maps for the two cities remain the same, with some differences in terms of buildings and geography to reflect the different time periods.\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto IV and its subsequent expansion packs The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are set in a third revision of Liberty City, set in 2008, which is a closer analogue to New York City and its boroughs than the GTA III version.[50] Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is also set in this version of Liberty City, although the Alderney portion of the map is not present.[51]\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto V, released in 2013, is set in a revised depiction of southern San Andreas that only features Los Santos (Los Angeles) to the south and the rural Blaine County to the north.[52] It includes revised landmarks such as the \\"Vinewood\\" sign (instead of Hollywood), Rockford Hills (instead of Beverly Hills), Del Perro Pier (instead of Santa Monica Pier), Los Santos International Airport (LSX) (instead of LAX), Los Santos Golf Club (instead of Los Angeles Country Club.), and Galileo Observatory (instead of Griffith Observatory). The game also features the town of Ludendorff in the fictional state of North Yankton. Los Angeles was extensively researched for Grand Theft Auto V. The team organised field research trips with tour guides and architectural historians and captured around 250,000 photos and hours of video footage during these visits.[53] Since the release of the game, hundreds of in-game buildings have been identified as being based on real-world landmarks.[54] The New Yorker's Sam Sweet notes that, with sales of game reaching thirteen million copies, \\"there will be more people living in the imaginary state of Los Santos than in the real city on which it was modelled.\\"[55]\\r\\nIn both Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Grand Theft Auto V, Los Santos and the state of San Andreas are depicted as being on an island an undetermined distance from the US mainland. In both games it is possible to circumnavigate the state by boat. Similarly, the versions of Liberty City and Alderney in Grand Theft Auto IV and expansion packs are also completely located on islands, as is Vice City. The GTA III rendition of Liberty City however, while mostly island, is connected to mainland on its Northwest corner (a region the player cannot navigate).[citation needed]\\r\\nOnly the expansion packs for the original Grand Theft Auto, London 1969 and London 1961, set in London, have featured a location outside the United States and used a real-life location.\\r\\nThe series has included a wide variety of voice actors. The original Grand Theft Auto, its mission packs and sequel, as well as Grand Theft Auto Advance and Chinatown Wars did not feature any voice credited to specific roles.[56][57] The first game in the series to do so was Grand Theft Auto III which, despite a limited budget and the series' low profile at the time,[58] featured several notable actors from film and television. These included Frank Vincent, Michael Madsen and Kyle MacLachlan, who all had prominent roles. At the time it was rare for a video game to use such high-profile actors, and Grand Theft Auto III is considered a pioneer in doing so.[59] The next game, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, featured more film actors, including Ray Liotta as the player character. Although the following title, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, also featured many notable film actorssuch as Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Fonda and James Woodsit had been decided that the use of such actors should be reduced, particularly for leading roles. As a result, many of the prominent roles in San Andreas were voiced by lower profile actors or rappers.[citation needed]\\r\\nFrom Liberty City Stories through to Grand Theft Auto V, the series has continued using lesser known actors to voice main characters, but still uses celebrities and real-life radio personalities to voice the DJs of the many radio stations featured in each game. Some games also feature celebrities portraying themselves, such as Lazlow Jones, Phil Collins,[60] Ricky Gervais[61] and Katt Williams.[citation needed]\\r\\nAccording to The Guinness World Records 2008 and 2009 Gamer's Edition, it is the most controversial video game series in history, with over 4,000 articles published about it, which include accusations of glamorising violence, corrupting gamers, and connection to real life crimes.[62]\\r\\nThe game was controversial from the very first incarnation of the series.[63] Grand Theft Auto was condemned in Britain, Germany, and France due to its \\"extreme violence\\",[64] and Brazil banned it outright.[64] Publicist Max Clifford planted sensational stories in tabloids in order to help sell the first game.[63][65][66]\\r\\nThe controversies flared up again with Grand Theft Auto III, since the 3D graphics made the violence more realistic, and players could pay for the services of prostitutes to restore their health, and if they wished, kill them to get some of their money back.[66]\\r\\nThere is also criticism from the focus on illegal activities in comparison with traditional \\"heroic\\" roles that other games offer. The main character can commit a wide variety of crimes and violent acts while dealing with only temporary consequences, including the killing of policemen and military personnel.\\r\\nThe sixth game in the series, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, also came under criticism. One mission in particular, in which the player must instigate a gang war between Haitian and Cuban gangs, has been controversial. Haitian and Cuban anti-defamation groups criticised the game.\\r\\nJean-Robert Lafortune of the Haitian American Grassroots Coalition is quoted as saying that \\"The game shouldn't be designed to destroy human life, it shouldn't be designed to destroy an ethnic group,\\" for this and similar scenarios, including lines in the game's script such as \\"kill the Haitian dickheads\\" said by character \\"Diaz\\" during an altercation between the player and a Haitian gang. After the threat of a lawsuit by the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition, Rockstar removed the word \\"Haitians\\" from this phrase in the game's subtitles.[67]\\r\\nSan Andreas was criticised initially due to its \\"gangster\\" elements, which include drugs, prostitution, and murder; but later due to the discovery of disabled interactive sex scenes, nicknamed Hot Coffee, which was a sexual minigame that was cut from the game, but remained in the game code, which was discovered in both the console and Windows versions of the game. Dubbed the \\"Hot Coffee mod\\", the minigame allowed players to have sex with their in-game girlfriends.\\r\\nAfter the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, modders managed to find the unused code in the game and released unofficial patches for the Windows and Xbox (with a modchip) versions as well as a PlayStation 2 version through the use of an Action Replay code enabling the player to engage in these sexual mini-games (dubbed \\"Hot Coffee\\" in reference to a euphemism for sex used in the game). These mini-games were left partially intact in the game's code. This prompted application of an AO (Adults Only) ESRB rating to the version of the game containing the leftover code. Take-Two Interactive was forced to re-release the game in order to restore the M (Mature) rating. A class action lawsuit against Take-Two was also filed as a result of the \\"Hot Coffee\\" code.[68][69]\\r\\nOne of the controversies involved with this game was Mothers Against Drunk Driving's (MADD) criticism of the ability to drink and drive as a new feature. MADD had even requested ESRB to change the rating of the game from \\"M\\" for ages seventeen and up to \\"AO\\", for adults only, because they felt it was inappropriate for children, even at the age of seventeen, to experience drunk driving in such a manner.[70] In the final game, drunk driving is a playable event, but it is a crime that automatically generates a wanted rating and main playable character Niko Bellic loudly (and drunkenly) proclaims that it is a \\"bad idea\\" and that he \\"should know better\\".[71]\\r\\nNotably, it is impossible to drive while drunk in the GTA IV expansions, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony. These were released after the criticism. It is, however, possible to drive drunk again in the successor, Grand Theft Auto V.[72]\\r\\nThe Lost and Damned expansion pack was condemned by US parents group Common Sense Media who issued a public warning against the pack's content due to a full-frontal nudity scene during one of the cutscenes. They claimed the game was \\"more controversial than its predecessors\\" because it featured \\"full frontal male nudity\\".[73]\\r\\nThere has been some controversy over a drug dealing minigame[75] along with comments that some Nintendo games are being aimed at children (despite the fact that the game was rated Mature). The drug dealing mini-game allows players to peddle six types of drugs around the city, but the profit the player makes depends on market conditions, which will be based on the area in which they deal, and the level of regular service this area receives from them.[76][77]\\r\\nA segment in the latest instalment caused controversy for scenes containing player initiated torture. The mission \\"By the Book\\" features graphic depictions of kneecapping, electrocution, dental extraction and waterboarding, and the player is required to perform the acts in order to progress in the game.[78][79][80]\\r\\nUK-based charity Freedom from Torture publicly condemned the use of torture scenes in Grand Theft Auto V. The organisation, who works to rehabilitate survivors of torture, joined other human rights charities who were outraged at a torture scene in the game in which the players have to pull teeth and electrocute an unarmed man in order to extract information. The charity's CEO Keith Best stated: Rockstar North has crossed a line by effectively forcing people to take on the role of a torturer and perform a series of unspeakable acts if they want to achieve success in the game.\\"[78]\\r\\nThe game has also been accused of sexism. The Los Angeles Times considered the game's satirical portrayals of women uncreative, and added that violent and sexist themes hurt the game experience.[81] Edge noted that while \\"every female in the game exists solely to be sneered, leered or laughed at\\", it treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence.[82] Sam Houser, Rockstar Games co-founder, felt that the development team sometimes overlooked their portrayal of women in Grand Theft Auto games, but that the weight towards male characters \\"fit with the story we wanted to tell\\".[83]\\r\\nFormer lawyer Jack Thompson has been involved in a number of attempts to get families of murder victims to hold the Grand Theft Auto series accountable for the death of their loved ones. Due to his conduct in this and related cases, Thompson was disbarred in 2008[84] and was fined more than $100,000 by the Florida Bar Association.[85]\\r\\nOn 20 October 2003, the families of Aaron Hamel and Kimberly Bede, two young people shot by teens William and Josh Buckner (who in statements to investigators claimed their actions were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III) filed a US$246 million lawsuit against publishers Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive Software, retailer Walmart, and PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment America.[86][87] Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two, filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in US District Court on 29 October 2003 that the \\"ideas and concepts as well as the 'purported psychological effects' on the Buckners are protected by the First Amendment's free-speech clause\\". The lawyer of the victims, Jack Thompson, denied that, but failed in his attempt to move the lawsuit into a state court and under Tennessee's consumer protection act.[88] Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal, and the case was closed.\\r\\nIn February 2005, a lawsuit was brought upon the makers and distributors of the Grand Theft Auto series claiming the games caused a teenager to shoot and kill three members of the Alabama police force. The shooting took place in June 2003 when Devin Moore, 17 years old at the time, was taken in for questioning by police in Fayette, Alabama regarding a stolen vehicle. Moore then grabbed a pistol from one of the police officers and shot and killed him along with another officer and dispatcher before fleeing in a police car.[89][90] One of Moore's attorneys, Jack Thompson, claimed it was Grand Theft Auto's graphic naturewith his constant playing timethat caused Moore to commit the murders, and Moore's family agrees. Damages were being sought from branches of GameStop and Wal-Mart in Jasper, Alabama, the stores from which Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, respectively, were purchased and also from the games' publisher Take-Two Interactive, and the PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony Computer Entertainment. On 29 March 2006 the case was dismissed and permission to appeal was denied.[91]\\r\\nIn May 2005, Jack Thompson appeared via satellite on the Glenn Beck program on CNN's Headline News. Thompson mentioned Devin Moore and said regarding Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City \\"There's no doubt in my mind [...] that but for Devin Moore's training on this cop killing simulator, he would not have been able to kill three cops in Fayette, Alabama who are now dead and in the ground. We are suing Take-Two, Sony, Wal-Mart, and GameStop for having trained Devin Moore to kill. He had no history of violence. No criminal record.\\"[92]\\r\\nIn September 2006, Thompson brought another lawsuit, claiming that Cody Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father Delbert Paul Posey, stepmother Tryone Schmid, and stepsister Marilea Schmid on a ranch in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The suit was filed on behalf of the victims' families.[93] The suit alleged that were it not for his obsessive playing of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, the murders would not have taken place.[94] Named in the suit were Cody Posey, Rockstar Games, Take-Two Interactive, and Sony. The suit asked for US$600 million in damages.[95] During the criminal trial, Posey's defence team argued he was abused by his father, and tormented by his stepmother.[96] Posey was also taking Zoloft at the time of the killings.[97] The lawsuit was dismissed in December 2007.[98]\\r\\nSeveral celebrities have sued Rockstar Games and/or Take-Two Interactive for purportedly violating their intellectual property or personality rights, including hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger,[99] Karen Gravano of Mob Wives,[100] and actress Lindsay Lohan.[101]\\r\\nEver since 2001, the Grand Theft Auto series has been a major success, both critically and financially. It has generated perfect or near perfect reviews and scores on almost all of the games; by September 2013, the series sold over 150 million copies worldwide,[166] and as of August 2015, Grand Theft Auto shipped over 220 million units worldwide.[6] The Times Online reported that Grand Theft Auto IV recorded 609,000 copies in the UK on its first day of release.[167] In its first week, Grand Theft Auto IV sold approximately 6 million copies worldwide and grossed over $500 million.[168]\\r\\nIn 2006, Grand Theft Auto was voted one of Britain's top 10 designs in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. The game appeared in a list of British design icons which included Concorde, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Mini, World Wide Web, Tomb Raider, K2 telephone box, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus and the Supermarine Spitfire.[8][169]\\r\\nThe series has broken several records, resulting in Guinness World Records awarding the series 10 world records in the Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include Most Guest Stars in a Video Game Series, Largest Voice Cast in a Video Game (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas), Largest In-Game Soundtrack (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) as well as Most Successful Entertainment Launch of All Time (Grand Theft Auto V). Guinness World Records also ranked Grand Theft Auto in third place on their list of top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy.[170] Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is listed as the most successful game on the PlayStation 2 according to The Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition.\\r\\nGrand Theft Auto III, San Andreas and Vice City currently lie at the 2nd, 5th and 6th highest rated PlayStation 2 games on Metacritic, respectively,[171] while Chinatown Wars is rated the best game on the Nintendo DS[172] and the second best on the PlayStation Portable,[173] and Grand Theft Auto IV is currently rated the second best game ever, with a score of 98, only trailing behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Also, Vice City, Grand Theft Auto III, San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V lie at 11th, 24th, 27th, 93rd and 2nd best PC games of all time, on Metacritic.[174][175] Along with this, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are currently placed 35th and 59th in the top Xbox 360 games.[176]\\r\\nThe release of Grand Theft Auto III is treated as a major event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier.[188]\\r\\nDuring interviews to mark the 10th anniversary of the release of Grand Theft Auto III, producer of the Street Fighter series, Yoshinori Ono, said \\"It would be no exaggeration to say that Grand Theft Auto III changed the industry, and we can basically separate the time before and after its emergence as distinct eras.\\" In the same article Bethesda studios director, Todd Howard, said \\"The mark of a truly great game is how many people try to recapture or emulate it and fail. There's a long line behind this one.\\"[189]\\r\\nSubsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting have been called \\"Grand Theft Auto clones\\". Some reviewers even extended this label to the Driver series, even though this series began years before the release of Grand Theft Auto III.[190] Grand Theft Auto clones are a type of 3D action-adventure game,[191][192][193][194][195] where players are given the ability to drive any vehicle or fire any weapon as they explore an open world.[196] These games often incorporate violent and criminal themes. Notable games that are comparable to Grand Theft Auto are Saints Row,[197] Scarface: The World Is Yours,[198] True Crime: Streets of LA,[199][200] Watch Dogs,[201] Sleeping Dogs,[202] Just Cause,[203] Mafia[204] and The Godfather.[205]","input":"What type of game is grand theft auto?"},{"output":"Christian","context":"Religion in the Philippines is marked by a majority of people being adherents of the Christian faith.[1] At least 92% of the population is Christian; about 81% belong to the Roman Catholic Church while about 11% belong to Protestant, Restorationist and independent Catholic denominations, such as Iglesia Filipina Independiente, Iglesia ni Cristo, Seventh-day Adventist Church, United Church of Christ in the Philippines and Evangelicals.[1] Officially, the Philippines is a secular nation, with the Constitution guaranteeing separation of church and state, and requiring the government to respect all religious beliefs equally.\\r\\nAccording to national religious surveys, about 5.6% of the population of the Philippines is Muslim, making Islam the second largest religion in the country. However, A 2012 estimate by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) stated that there were 10.7 million Muslims, or approximately 11 percent of the total population.[2] Most Muslims live in parts of Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu Archipelago ÿ an area known as Bangsamoro or the Moro region.[3] Some have migrated into urban and rural areas in different parts of the country. Most Muslim Filipinos practice Sunni Islam according to the Shafii school.[4] There are some Ahmadiyya Muslims in the country.[5]\\r\\nPhilippine traditional religions are still practiced by an estimated 2% of the population,[6][7] made up of many aboriginal peoples, tribal groups, and people who have reverted back into traditional religions from Catholic/Christian or Islamic religions. These religions are often syncretized with Christianity and Islam. Animism, folk religion, and shamanism remain present as undercurrents of mainstream religion, through the albularyo, the babaylan, and the manghihilot. Buddhism is practiced by 2% of the populations by the Japanese-Filipino community,[8][6][7][9] and together with Taoism and Chinese folk religion is also dominant in Chinese communities. There are smaller number of followers of Sikhs, Hinduism,[6][7][9] and Judaism, and Baha'i.[10] More than 10% of the population is non-religious, with the percentage of non-religious people overlapping with various faiths, as the vast majority of the non-religious select a religion in the Census for nominal purposes.[6][7][11]\\r\\nAccording to the 2010 census, Evangelicals compromised 2% of the population, however 2010 surveys and data such Joshua Project and Operation World estimated the evangelical population to be around 11ÿ13% of the population.[12] It is particularly strong among American and Korean communities, Northern Luzon especially in Cordillera Administrative Region, Southern Mindanao[13] and many other tribal groups in the Philippines.[14] Protestants both mainline and evangelical have gained significant annual growth rate up to 10% since 1910 to 2015.[15]\\r\\nThe Philippine Statistics Authority in October 2015 reported that 80.58% of the total Filipino population were Roman Catholics, 10.8% were Protestant and 5.57% were Muslims.[16]\\r\\nDuring pre-colonial times, a form of animism was widely practiced in the Philippines. Each of the ethno-linguistic tribe in the archipelago practices a distinct indigenous religion. Today, the Philippines is mostly Catholic and other forms of Christianity, and only a handful of the indigenous tribes continue to practice the old traditions. These are a collection of beliefs and cultural mores anchored more or less in the idea that the world is inhabited by spirits and supernatural entities, both good and bad, and that respect be accorded to them through nature worship. These spirits all around nature are known as \\"diwatas\\", showing cultural relationship with Hinduism (Devatas). Currently, there are 135 ethno-linguistic tribes in the Philippines according to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino. Less than half of which still practice indigenous religions which have been used prior to Spanish colonialism.\\r\\nSome worship specific deities, such as the Tagalog supreme deity, Bathala, and his children Adlaw, Mayari, and Tala, or the Visayan deity Kan-Laon. Others practice Ancestor worship (anitos).[citation needed] Variations of animistic practices occur in different ethnic groups. Magic, chants and prayers are often key features. Its practitioners were highly respected (and some feared) in the community, as they were healers, midwives (hilot), shamans, witches and warlocks (mangkukulam), priests/priestesses (babaylan/katalonan), tribal historians and wizened elders that provided the spiritual and traditional life of the community. In the Visayan regions, shamanistic and animistic beliefs in witchcraft (barang) and mythical creatures like aswang (vampires), duwende (dwarves), and bakonawa (a gigantic sea serpent), may exist in some indigenous peoples alongside more mainstream Christian and Islamic faiths.\\r\\nSpanish missionaries during the 16th century arrived in the Philippines noted warrior priestesses leading tribal spiritual affairs. Many were condemned as pagan heretics. Although suppressed, these matriarchal tendencies run deep in Filipino society and can still be seen in the strong leadership roles modern Filipino women are assuming in business, politics, academia, the arts and in religious institutions.\\r\\nNominally animists constitute about one percent of the population.[citation needed] But animism's influence pervade daily life and practice of the colonial religions that took root in the Philippines. Elements of folk belief melded with Christian and Islamic practices to give a unique perspective on these religions.\\r\\nJust like the way Hinduism and Shintoism started, where they began as a collection of different indigenous belief systems from different ethnic groups, the indigenous belief systems of the Philippines are sometimes referred to as Dayawism. The term itself came from the word, 'dayaw', which is an indigenous word found in all indigenous languages in the country. The term means to give praise, to be proud of oneself and the nation the self represents, enhancements or improvements, or festivity and pride, depending on the language. Other terms used for the collection of Philippine indigenous religions are Anitism and Bathalism, although the two terms are Tagalog-centrist in terminology.[17][18][19][20]\\r\\nDue to the influx of Christianity, Islam, and other world religions in traditional communities, the indigenous practices, rituals, and spiritual performances and knowledge of indigenous Filipinos are fast disappearing. Cultural workers in the country suggest the Paiwan Model, which was made by the Taiwanese government to preserve indigenous religions, to save the Philippines' own indigenous religions. The indigenous practices and shamanism of the Paiwan people of Taiwan was the fastest declining religion in the country. This prompted the Taiwanense government to preserve the religion and to push for the establishment of the Paiwan School of Shamanism where religious leaders teach their apprentices the native religion so that it will never be lost. It became an effective medium in preserving, and even uplifting the Paiwan people's indigenous religion.\\r\\nIn the Philippines, shamanism is referred as dayawism, meaning 'gallant religions that give thanks to all living and non-living things'. As of 2018, there is no established school of dayawism in the Philippines, making the hundreds of indigenous religions in the country in great peril from extinction due to the influx of colonial-era religions. Each indigenous religion in the Philippines is distinct from each other, possessing unique epics, pantheons, belief systems, and other intangible heritage pertaining to religious beliefs. Due to this immense diversity in indigenous religions, a singular school of dayawism is not feasible. Rather, hundreds of schools of dayawism pertaining to an ethno-linguistic tribe is a better supplement to the current religious landscape in the Philippines.[21]\\r\\nThe Bah' Faith in the Philippines started in 1921 with the first Bah' first visiting the Philippines that year,[22] and by 1944 a Bah' Local Spiritual Assembly was established.[23] In the early 1960s, during a period of accelerated growth, the community grew from 200 in 1960 to 1000 by 1962 and 2000 by 1963. In 1964 the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah's of the Philippines was elected and by 1980 there were 64,000 Bah's and 45 local assemblies.[24] The Bah's have been active in multi/inter-faith developments. The 2005 World Christian Encyclopedia estimates the Bah' population of the Philippines at about 247,500.[25]\\r\\nNo written record exists about the early Buddhism in the Philippines. However, archaeological discoveries and the few scant references in the other nations' historical records can tell about the existence of Buddhism from the 9th century onward in the islands. These records mention the independent states that comprise the Philippines and which show that they were not united as one country in the early days. Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts. The style are of Vajrayana influence.[citation needed]\\r\\nLoanwords with Buddhist context appear in languages of the Philippines.[26][27] Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts.[28][29] The style are of Vajrayana influence.[30][31] The Philippines's early states must have become the tributary states of the powerful Buddhist Srivijaya empire that controlled the trade and its sea routes from the 6th century to the 13th century in Southeast Asia. The statess trade contacts with the empire long before or in the 9th century must have served as the conduit for introducing Vajrayana Buddhism to the islands.\\r\\nBoth Srivijaya empire in Sumatra and Majapahit empire in Java were unknown in history until 1918 when the Ecole Francaise d'Extreme Orient's George Coedes postulated their existence because they had been mentioned in the records of the Chinese Tang and Sung imperial dynasties. Ji Ying, a Chinese monk and scholar, stayed in Sumatra from 687 to 689 on his way to India. He wrote on the Srivijaya's splendour, \\"Buddhism was flourishing throughout the islands of Southeast Asia. Many of the kings and the chieftains in the islands in the southern seas admire and believe in Buddhism, and their hearts are set on accumulating good action.\\"\\r\\nBoth empires replaced their early Theravada Buddhist religion with Vajrayana Buddhism in the 7th century.[32]\\r\\nThe Philippiness archaeological finds include a few of Buddhist artifacts, most of them dated to the 9th century. The artifacts reflect the iconography of the Srivijaya empires Vajrayana Buddhism and its influences on the Philippiness early states. The artifactss distinct features point to their production in the islands and they hint at the artisanss or goldsmithss knowledge of the Buddhist culture and the Buddhist literature because the artisans have made these unique works of Buddhist art. The artifacts imply also the presence of the Buddhist believers in the places where these artifacts turned up. These places extended from the Agusan-Surigao area in Mindanao island to Cebu, Palawan, and Luzon islands. Hence, Vajrayana Buddhism must have spread far and wide throughout the archipelago. And Vajrayana Buddhism must have become the religion of the majority of the inhabitants in the islands.\\r\\nIn 1225, China's Zhao Rugua, a superintendent of maritime trade in Fukien province wrote the book entitled Zhu Fan Zhi (Chinese: ]; literally: \\"\\"Account of the Various Barbarians\\"\\") in which he described trade with a country called Ma-i in the island of Mindoro in Luzon,(pronounced \\"Ma-yi\\") which was a prehispanic Philippine state. In it he said:\\r\\nThe country of Mai is to the north of Borneo. The natives live in large villages on the opposite banks of a stream and cover themselves with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a loin cloth. There are metal images of Buddhas of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds.\\r\\n.[33]\\r\\n\\"The gentleness of Tagalog customs that the first Spaniards found, very lfferent from those of other provinces of the same race and in Luzon itself, can very well be the effect of Buddhism \\"There are copper Buddha's\\" images.\\r\\n[34]\\r\\nThe gold statue of the deity Tara is the most significant Buddhist artifact. In the Vajrayana Buddhist tradition, Tara symbolizes the Absolute in its emptiness as the wisdom hearts essence that finds its expression through love and through compassion. The Vajrayana tradition also tells about the outpouring of the human hearts compassion that manifests Tara and about the fascinating story of the Bodhisattva of Compassion shedding a tear out of pity for the suffering of all sentient beings when he hears their cries. The tear created a lake where a lotus flower emerges. It bears Tara who relieves their sorrow and their pain.\\r\\nThe Golden Tara was discovered in 1918 in Esperanza, Agusan and it has been kept in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Illinois since the 1920s. Henry Otley Beyer, the Philippiness pioneer anthropologist-archaeologist, and some experts have agreed on its identity and have dated it to belong within 900-950 CE, which covers the Sailendra period of the Srivijaya empire. They can not place, however, the Golden Taras provenance because it has distinct features.\\r\\nIn the archipelago that was to become the Philippines, the statues of the Hindu gods were hidden to prevent their destruction by a religion which destroyed all cult images. One statue, a \\"Golden Tara\\", a 4-pound gold statue of a Hindu-Malayan goddess, was found in Mindanao in 1917. The statue, denoted the Agusan Image, is now in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. The image is that of a Hindu-Malayan female deity, seated cross-legged. It is made of \\"twenty-one carat gold and weighs nearly four pounds.\\" It has a richly ornamented headdress and many ornaments in the arms and other parts of the body. Scholars date it to the late 13th or early 14th century. It was made by local artists, perhaps copying from an imported Javanese model. The gold that was used was from this area, since Javanese miners were known to have been engaged in gold mining in Butuan at this time.\\r\\nThe existence of these gold mines, this artefact and the presence of \\"foreigners\\" proves the existence of some foreign trade, gold as element in the barter economy, and of cultural and social contact between the natives and \\"foreigners.\\" As previously stated, this statue is not in The Philippines. Louise Adriana Wood (whose husband, Leonard Wood, was military-governor of the Moro Province in 1903-1906 and governor general in 1921-1927) raised funds for its purchase by the Chicago Museum of Natural History. It is now on display in that museum's Gold Room.\\r\\nAccording to Prof. Beyer, considered the \\"Father of Philippine Anthropology and Archaeology\\", a woman in 1917 found it on the left bank of the Wawa River near Esperanza, Agusan, projecting from the silt in a ravine after a storm and flood. From her hands it passed into those of Bias Baklagon, a local government official. Shortly after, ownership passed to the Agusan Coconut Company, to whom Baklagon owed a considerable debt. Mrs. Wood bought it from the coconut company.\\r\\nA golden statuette of the Hindu-Buddhist goddess Kinnara found in an archeological dig in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur. The Philippines's archaeological finds include many ancient gold artifacts. Most of them have been dated to belong to the 9th century iconography of the Srivijaya empire. The artifactss distinct features point to their production in the islands. It is probable that they were made locally because archaeologist Peter Bellwood discovered the existence of an ancient goldsmiths shop that made the 20-centuries-old lingling-o, or omega-shaped gold ornaments in Batanes.[35] Archaeological finds include Buddhist artifacts.[28][29] The style are of Vajrayana influence.[30][31]\\r\\nThe other finds are the garuda, the mythical bird that has been common to Buddhism and Hinduism, and several Padmapani images. Padmapani has been also known as Avalokitesvara, the enlightened being or Bodhisattva of Compassion.[36]\\r\\nSurviving Buddhist images and sculptures are primarily found in and at Tabon Cave.[37] Recent research conducted by Philip Maise has included the discovery of giant sculptures, has also discovered what he believes to be cave paintings within the burial chambers in the caves depicting the Journey to the West.[38]\\r\\nMany Filipino customs have strong Buddhist influences. Estimates of the Buddhist population of the Philippines is around 2%.[8] Buddhism in the Philippines is growing fast, mainly because of increasing immigration to the country. Buddhism is largely confined to the Filipino Chinese, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese communities though local adherents are on the rise.[citation needed] There are temples in Manila, Davao, and Cebu, and other places. Several schools of Buddhism are present in the Philippines ÿ Mahayana, Vajrayana, Theravada, as well as groups such as Soka Gakkai International.[39]\\r\\nChristianity arrived in the Philippines with the landing of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. In the late 16th century, the archipelago was claimed for Spain and named it after its king. Missionary activity during the country's colonial rule by Spain and the United States led the transformation of the Philippines into the first and then, along with East Timor, one of two predominantly Catholic nations in East Asia, with approximately 92.5% of the population belonging to the Christian faith.[6][40]\\r\\nRoman Catholicism is the predominant religion and the largest Christian denomination, with estimates of approximately 80.6% of the population belonging to this faith in the Philippines.[41] The country has a significant Spanish Catholic tradition, and Spanish style Catholicism is embedded in the culture, which was acquired from priests or friars.\\r\\nThe Catholic Church has great influence on Philippine society and politics. One typical event is the role of the Catholic hierarchy during the bloodless People Power Revolution of 1986. Then-Archbishop of Manila and de facto Primate of the Philippines, Jaime Cardinal Sin appealed to the public via radio to congregate along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in support of rebel forces. Some seven million people responded to the call between 22ÿ25 February, and the non-violent protests successfully forced President Ferdinand E. Marcos out of power and into exile in Hawaii.\\r\\nSeveral Catholic holidays are culturally important as family occasions, and are observed in the civil calendar. Chief among these are Christmas, which includes celebrations of the civil New Year, and the more solemn Holy Week, which may occur in March or April. Every November, Filipino families celebrate All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day as a single holiday in honour of the saints and the dead, visiting and cleaning ancestral graves, offering prayers, and feasting. As of 2018, Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 was added as a special non-working holiday. [42]\\r\\nIglesia ni Cristo (English: Church of Christ; Spanish: Iglesia de Cristo) is the largest entirely indigenous-initiated religious organisation in the Philippines comprising roughly 2% of religious affiliation in the Philippines.[43][44][45][46][47] Felix Y. Manalo officially registered the church with the Philippine Government on July 27, 1914[48] and because of this, most publications refer to him as the founder of the church. Felix Manalo claimed that he was restoring the church of Christ that was lost for 2,000 years. He died on April 12, 1963, aged 76.\\r\\nThe Iglesia ni Cristo is known for its large evangelical missions. The largest of which was the Grand Evangelical Mission (GEM) which also occurred simultaneously on 19 sites across the country. In Manila site alone, more than 600,000 people attended the event.[49] Other programs includes the Lingap sa Mamamayan (Aid to Humanity),[50] The Kabayan Ko Kapatid Ko (My Countrymen, My Brethren) and various resettlement projects for affected individuals.[51]\\r\\nThe primary purpose of the Church is to worship the almighty God based on his teachings as taught by Jesus Christ and as recorded in the bible. The churchs major activities include worship service, missionary works, edification. According to the March 2012 issue of PASUGO Magazine (p.?24), the Demographics of the Iglesia ni Cristo then was composed of 112 countries and 7 territories comprising 110 races.\\r\\nThe Jesus Miracle Crusade International Ministry (JMCIM) is an apostolic Pentecostal religious group from the Philippines which believes in the of the gospel of Jesus Christ with signs, wonders, miracles and faith in God for healing. JMCIM was founded by evangelist Wilde E. Almeda on February 14, 1975.\\r\\nMembers Church of God International (Filipino: Mga Kasapi Iglesia ng Dios Internasyonal) is a religious organization popularly known through its television program, Ang Dating Daan (Tagalog for \\"The Old Path\\").\\r\\nThe church is known for their \\"Bible Expositions\\", where guests and members are given a chance to ask any biblical question to the Overall Servant of the church, Eliseo Soriano directly from the Bible. He and his co-servants expose teachings of asked religions which are not biblical and expands more knowledge about some misunderstood verses by using old manuscripts and reliable bible translations. Besides general preaching, they also established charity works. Among these humanitarian services are the charity homes for the senior citizens and orphaned children and teenagers; transient homes; medical missions; full college scholarship; start-up capital for livelihood projects; vocational trainings for the differently-abled; free legal assistance; free bus, jeepney, and train rides for commuters and senior citizens, and; free Bible for everyone. In its effort to save lives, MCGI is now one of the major blood donor in the Philippines, as acknowledged by the Philippine National Red Cross.[52]\\r\\nThe Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus (Filipino: Kabanalbanalang Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus),[53][54] is an independent Christian denomination officially registered in the Philippines by Teofilo D. Ora in May 1922. The Church claims to restore the visible Church founded in Jerusalem by Christ Jesus. It has spread to areas including California, USA; Calgary, Canada, Dubai, UAE and other Asian countries. The Church will be celebrating its centennial anniversary in May 2022.\\r\\nThe church was founded by Bishop Teofilo D. Ora in 1922. He, along with Avelino Santiago and Nicolas Perez, split off from the Iglesia ni Cristo (Church of Christ) in 1922. They initially called their church Iglesia Verdadera de Cristo Hesus (True Church of Christ Jesus). However, following a religious doctrine controversy, Nicolas Perez split off from the group and registered an offshoot called Iglesia ng Dios kay Kristo Hesus, Haligi at Suhay ng Katotohanan (Church of God in Christ Jesus, the Pillar and Support of the Truth). Teofilo D. Ora was bishop until his death in 1969. He was officially succeeded by Bishop Salvador C. Payawal who led the church until 1989. Subsequent bishops were Bishop Gamaliel T. Payawal (1989 to 2003) and Bishop Isagani N. Capistrano (2003ÿpresent). It was during Gamaliel Payawal's tenure when the church was renamed as Most Holy Church of God in Christ Jesus.\\r\\nThe Philippine Independent Church (officially Spanish: Iglesia Filipina Independiente, IFI; colloquially known as the Aglipayan Church) is an independent Christian denomination in the form of a national church in the Philippines. Its schism from the Catholic Church was proclaimed in 1902 by the members of the Uni܇n Obrera Democrtica Filipina due to the alleged mistreatment of Filipinos by Spanish priests and the execution of nationalist Jos Rizal under Spanish colonial rule.\\r\\nIsabelo de los Reyes was one of the initiators of the separation, and suggested that former Catholic priest Gregorio Aglipay be the head of the church. It is also known as the Aglipayan Church after its first Obispo Maximo, Gregorio Aglipay.\\r\\nCommonly shared beliefs in the Aglipayan Church are the rejection of the Apostolic Succession solely to the Petrine Papacy, the acceptance of priestly ordination of women, the free option of clerical celibacy, the tolerance to join Freemasonry groups, non-committal in belief regarding transubstantiation and Real Presence of the Eucharist, and the advocacy of contraception and same-sex civil rights among its members. Many saints canonised by Rome after the schism are also not officially recognised by the Aglipayan church and its members.\\r\\nAs of 2010[update], Aglipayans in the Philippines numbered about a million members, with most from the northern part of Luzon, especially in the Ilocos Region. Congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The church is the second-largest single Christian denomination in the country after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 2.6% of the total population of the Philippines.[citation needed]\\r\\nThe Apostolic Catholic Church (ACC) is a catholic denomination founded in the 1980s in Hermosa, Bataan. It formally separated in the Roman Catholic Church in 1992 when Patriarch Dr. John Florentine Teruel registered it as a Protestant and Independent Catholic denomination. Today, it has more than 5 million members worldwide. The largest international congregations are in Japan, United States and Canada.\\r\\nOrthodoxy has been continuously present in the Philippines for more than 200 years.[55] It is represented by two groups, by the Exarchate of the Philippines (a jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople governed by the Orthodox Metropolitanate of Hong Kong and Southeast Asia), and by the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Mission in the Philippines (a jurisdiction of the Antiochian Orthodox Church governed by the Antiochian Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia, New Zealand, and All Oceania). In 1999, it was asserted that there were about 560 Orthodox church members in the Philippines.[56]\\r\\nProtestantism arrived in the Philippines with the take-over of the islands by Americans at the turn of the 20th century. Nowadays, they comprise about 10%ÿ15% of the population with an annual growth rate of 10% since 1910[57] and constitute the largest Christian grouping after Roman Catholicism. In 1898, Spain lost the Philippines to the United States. After a bitter fight for independence against its new occupiers, Filipinos surrendered and were again colonized. The arrival of Protestant American missionaries soon followed. Protestant church organizations established in the Philippines during the 20th century include the following:\\r\\nMembers Church of God in Jesus Christ Worldwide (also known as Miembro de la Iglesia de Dios en Todo el Mundo Inc.) is an independent Christian organization with headquarters in the Philippines led by Wilfredo \\"Bro. Willy\\" Santiago, a former Bible reader for Members Church of God International (MCGI). Willy Santiago was excommunicated from MCGI due to various violations. Santiago is currently building a new church headquarters in Malolos, Bulacan.\\r\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Philippines was founded during the SpanishÿAmerican War in 1898. Two men from Utah who were members of the United States artillery battery, and who were also set apart as missionaries by the Church before they left the United States, preached while stationed in the Philippines. Missionary work picked up after World War II, and in 1961 the Church was officially registered in the Philippines.[59] In 1969, the Church had spread to eight major islands and had the highest number of baptisms of any area in the Church. A temple was built in 1984 which located in Quezon City and another in Cebu City, completed in 2010. Membership was 710,764 in 2015.[60]\\r\\nIslam reached the Philippines in the 14th century with the arrival of Muslim traders from the Persian Gulf, Southern India, and their followers from several sultanate governments in Maritime Southeast Asia. Islam's predominance reached all the way to the shores of Manila Bay, home to several Muslim kingdoms. During the Spanish conquest, Islam had a rapid decline as the predominant monotheistic faith in the Philippines as a result of the introduction of Roman Catholicism by Spanish missionaries and via the Spanish Inquisition.[66] The southern Filipino tribes were among the few indigenous Filipino communities that resisted Spanish rule and conversions to Roman Catholicism. The vast majority of Muslims in Philippines follow Sunni Islam of Shafi school of jurisprudence, with small Shiite and Ahmadiyya minorities.[5] Islam is the oldest recorded monotheistic religion in the Philippines.\\r\\nAs of 2015[update]. According to the Philippine Statistics Authority,[16] the Muslim population of Philippines in 2015 was 5.57%. However, a 2012 estimate by the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) stated that there were 10.7 million Muslims, or approximately 11 percent of the total population.[2]\\r\\nIn 1380 Karim ul' Makhdum the first Arabian trader reached the Sulu Archipelago and Jolo in the Philippines and through trade throughout the island established Islam in the country. In 1390 the Minangkabau's Prince Rajah Baguinda and his followers preached Islam on the islands.[67] The Sheik Karimal Makdum Mosque was the first mosque established in the Philippines on Simunul in Mindanao in the 14th century. Subsequent settlements by Arab missionaries traveling to Malaysia and Indonesia helped strengthen Islam in the Philippines and each settlement was governed by a Datu, Rajah and a Sultan.\\r\\nBy the next century conquests had reached the Sulu islands in the southern tip of the Philippines where the population was animistic and they took up the task of converting the animistic population to Islam with renewed zeal. By the 15th century, half of Luzon (Northern Philippines) and the islands of Mindanao in the south had become subject to the various Muslim sultanates of Borneo and much of the population in the South were converted to Islam. However, the Visayas was largely dominated by Hindu-Buddhist societies led by rajahs and datus who strongly resisted Islam. One reason could be due to the economic and political disasters prehispanic Muslim pirates from the Mindanao region bring during raids. These frequent attacks gave way to naming present-day Cebu as then-Sugbo or scorched earth which was a defensive technique implemented by the Visayans so the pirates have nothing much to loot.[68][69]\\r\\nMoro (derived from the Spanish word meaning Moors) is the appellation inherited from the Spaniards, for Filipino Muslims and tribal groups of Mindanao. The Moros seek to establish an independent Islamic province in Mindanao to be named Bangsamoro. The term Bangsamoro is a combination of an Old Malay word meaning nation or state with the Spanish word Moro. A significant Moro rebellion occurred during the PhilippineÿAmerican War. Conflicts and rebellion have continued in the Philippines from the pre-colonial period up to the present.\\r\\nThe Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) comprises the Philippines' predominantly Muslim provinces, namely: Basilan (except Isabela City), Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, and the Islamic City of Marawi. It is the only region with its own government. The regional capital is at Cotabato City, although this city is outside of its jurisdiction.\\r\\nEven since the 1590s some Jews fleeing from The Inquisition were recorded to have come to the Philippines. As of 2005, Filipino Jews number at the very most 18,500 people. As of 2011[update], Metro Manila boasted the largest Jewish community in the Philippines[citation needed] which, as of 2008, consisted of roughly 100 families.[70]\\r\\nThe country's only synagogue, Beth Yaacov, is located in Makati.[70] There are other Jews elsewhere in the country,[70] but these are much fewer and almost all transients,[71] either diplomats or business envoys, and their existence is almost totally unknown in mainstream society. There are a few Israelis in Manila recruiting caregivers for Israel, some work in call centers, businessmen and a few other executives. A number are converts to Judaism.\\r\\nThe Srivijaya Empire and Majapahit Empire on what is now Malaysia and Indonesia, introduced Hinduism and Buddhism to the islands.[72] Ancient statues of Hindu-Buddhist gods have been found in the Philippines dating as far back as 600 to 1600 years from present.[73]\\r\\nThe archipelagoes of Southeast Asia were under the influence of Hindu Tamil people, Gujarati people and Indonesian traders through the ports of Malay-Indonesian islands. Indian religions, possibly an amalgamated version of Hindu-Buddhist arrived in Philippines archipelago in the 1st millennium, through the Indonesian kingdom of Srivijaya followed by Majapahit. Archeological evidence suggesting exchange of ancient spiritual ideas from India to the Philippines includes the 1.79 kilogram, 21 carat gold Hindu goddess Agusan (sometimes referred to as Golden Tara), found in Mindanao in 1917 after a storm and flood exposed its location.\\r\\nAnother gold artifact, from the Tabon caves in the island of Palawan, is an image of Garuda, the bird who is the mount of Vishnu. The discovery of sophisticated Hindu imagery and gold artifacts in Tabon caves has been linked to those found from Oc Eo, in the Mekong Delta in Southern Vietnam.[74] These archaeological evidence suggests an active trade of many specialized goods and gold between India and Philippines and coastal regions of Vietnam and China. Golden jewelry found so far include rings, some surmounted by images of Nandi ÿ the sacred bull, linked chains, inscribed gold sheets, gold plaques decorated with repouss images of Hindu deities.[75]\\r\\nToday Hinduism is largely confined to the Indian Filipinos and the expatriate Indian community. Theravada and Vajrayana Buddhism, are practiced by Tibetans, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Thai nationals. There are Hindu temples in Manila, as well as in the provinces. There are temples also for Sikhism, sometimes located near Hindu temples. The two Paco temples are well known, comprising a Hindu temple and a Sikh temple.\\r\\nDentsu Communication Institute Inc., Research Centre for Japan said in 2006 that about 11% of the population are irreligious.[76] Other sources put the number at less than 0.1%.[77]\\r\\nIn February 2009, Filipino Freethinkers[78] was formed. Since 2011, the Philippine Atheists and Agnostics Society has held its OUT Campaigns in Rizal Park and Quezon Memorial Circle. Also it held two feeding programs \\"Good without Religion\\" in Bacoor, Cavite.[79] The society also is a member affiliate and associate of various international atheist organizations such as the Atheist Alliance International, Institute for Science and Human Values, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union, as one among secular organizations that promotes free thought and scientific development in the Philippines.\\r\\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines declares: The separation of Church and State shall be inviolable. (Article II, Section 6), and, No law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or preference, shall forever be allowed. No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or political rights. (Article III, Section 5). Joaquin Bernas, a Filipino Jesuit specializing in constitutional law, acknowledges that there were complex issues that were brought to court and numerous attempts to use the separation of Church and State against the Roman Catholic Church, but he defends the statement, saying that the fact that he [Marcos] tried to do it does not deny the validity of the separation of church and state.[80]\\r\\nOn April 28, 2004, the Philippines Supreme Court reversed the ruling of a lower court ordering five religious leaders to refrain from endorsing a candidate for elective office.[81][82] Manila Judge Conception Alarcon-Vergara ruled that the \\"head of a religious organization who influences or threatens to punish members could be held liable for coercion and violation of citizen's right to vote freely\\". The lawsuit filed by Social Justice Society party stated that \\"the Churchs active participation in partisan politics, using the awesome voting strength of its faithful flock, will enable it to elect men to public office who will in turn be forever beholden to its leaders, enabling them to control the government\\". They claimed that this violates the Philippine constitution's separation of Church and State clause. The named respondents were Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle, El Shaddai Movement Leader Mike Velarde, Iglesia ni Cristo Executive Minister Eduardo V. Manalo and Jesus Is Lord Church leader Eddie Villanueva. Manalo's Iglesia ni Cristo practices bloc voting. Former Catholic Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin had been instrumental in rallying support for the assumption to power of Corazon Aquino and Gloria Arroyo. Velarde supported Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Benigno Aquino III while Villanueva endorsed Fidel Ramos and Jose De Venecia.

CODIS consists of three levels of information; Local DNA Index Systems (LDIS) where DNA profiles originate, State DNA Index Systems (SDIS) which allows for laboratories within states to share information, and the National DNA Index System (NDIS) which allows states to compare DNA information with one another.\\r\\nThe CODIS software contains multiple different databases depending on the type of information being searched against. Examples of these databases include, missing persons, convicted offenders, and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. Each state, and the federal system, has different laws for collection, upload, and analysis of information contained within their database. However, for privacy reasons, the CODIS database does not contain any personal identifying information, such as the name associated with the DNA profile. The uploading agency is notified of any hits to their samples and are tasked with the dissemination of personal information pursuant to their laws.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creation of a national DNA database within the U.S. was first mentioned by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM) in 1989.[1] In 1990, the FBI began a pilot DNA databasing program with 14 state and local laboratories.[2] In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act which authorized the FBI to create a national DNA database of convicted offenders as well, as separate databases for missing persons and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. The Act also required that laboratories participating in the CODIS program maintain accreditation from an independent nonprofit organization that is actively involved in the forensic fields and that scientists processing DNA samples for submission into CODIS maintain proficiency and are routinely tested to ensure the quality of the profiles being uploaded into the database.[3] The national level of CODIS (NDIS) was implemented in October 1998. Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, federal law enforcement, the Army Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in the national sharing of DNA profiles.[4]\\r\\nThe CODIS database contains several different indexes for the storage of DNA profile information. For assistance in criminal investigations three indexes exist: the offender index, which contains DNA profiles of those convicted of crimes; the arrestee index, which contains profiles of those arrestee of crimes pursuit to the laws of the particular state; and the forensic index, which contains profiles collected from a crime scene.[5] Additional indexes, such as the unidentified human remain index, the missing persons index, and the biological relatives of missing persons index, are used to assist in identifying missing persons.[5] Specialty indexes also exist for other specimens that don't fall into the other categories. These indexes include the staff index, for profiles of employees who work with the samples, and the multi-allelic offender index, for single-source samples that have three or more alleles at two or more loci.[6]\\r\\nAs of February 2017[update], NDIS contains more than 12 million offender profiles, more than 2.5 million arrestee profiles and more than 750 thousand forensic profiles.[7] The effectiveness of CODIS is measured by the number of investigations aided through database hits. As of February 2017[update], CODIS has aided in over 350 thousand investigations and produced more than 365 thousand hits.[7] Each state has their own SDIS database and each state can set their own inclusionary standards that can be less strict than the national level. For this reason, a number of profiles that are present in state level databases are not in the national database and are not routinely searched across state lines.[8]\\r\\nThe bulk of identifications using CODIS rely on short tandem repeats (STRs) that are scattered throughout the human genome and on statistics that are used to calculate the rarity of that specific profile in the population.[9] STRs are a type of copy-number variation and comprise a sequence of nucleotide base pairs that is repeated over and over again. At each location tested during DNA analysis, also known as a locus (plural loci), a person has two sets of repeats, one from the father and one from the mother. Each set is measured and the number of repeat copies is recorded.[10] If both strands, inherited from the parents, contain the same number of repeats at that locus the person is said to be homozygous at that locus. If the repeat numbers differ they are said to be heterozygous. Every possible difference at a locus is an allele.[11] This repeat determination is performed across a number of loci and the repeat values is the DNA profile that is uploaded to CODIS. As of January 1, 2017, requirements for upload to national level for known offender profiles is 20 loci.[4]\\r\\nAlternatively, CODIS allows for the upload of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) information into the missing persons indexes. Since mtDNA is passed down from mother to offspring it can be used to link remains to still living relatives who have the same mtDNA.[4]\\r\\nPrior to January 1, 2017, the national level of CODIS required that known offender profiles have a set of 13 loci called the \\"CODIS core\\". Since then, the requirement has expanded to include seven additional loci. Partial profiles are also allowed in CODIS in separate indexes and are common in crime scene samples that are degraded or are mixtures of multiple individuals. Upload of these profiles to the national level of CODIS requires at least eight of the core loci to be present as well as a profile rarity of 1 in 10 million (calculated using population statistics).[4]\\r\\nLoci that fall within a gene are named after the gene. For example TPOX, is named after the human thyroid peroxidase gene.[12] Loci that do not fall within genes are given a standard naming scheme for uniformity. These loci are named D + the chromosome the locus is on + S + the order in which the location on that chromosome was described. For example, D3S1358 is on the third chromosome and is the 1358th location described.[13] The CODIS core are listed below; loci with asterisks are the new core and were added to the list in January 2017.\\r\\nThe loci used in CODIS were chosen because they are in regions of noncoding DNA, sections that do not code for proteins. These sections should not be able to tell investigators any additional information about the person such as their hair or eye color, or their race.[14] However, new advancements in the understanding of genetic markers and ancestry have indicated that the CODIS loci may actually contain some phenotypic information.[15][16]\\r\\nWhile the U.S. database is not directly connected to any other country, the underlying CODIS software is used by other agencies around the world. As of April 2016[update], the CODIS software is used by 90 international laboratories in 50 countries.[2][15] International police agencies that want to search the U.S. database can submit a request to the FBI for review. If the request is reasonable and the profile being searched would meet inclusionary standards for a U.S. profile, such as number of loci, the request can be searched at the national level or forwarded to any states where reasonable suspicion exists that they may be present in that level of the database.[4]\\r\\n?????Collection upon conviction only\\r\\n?????Collection from some felony arrests\\r\\n?????Collection from all felony arrests\\r\\nThe original purpose of the CODIS database was to build upon the sex offender registry through the DNA collection of convicted sex offenders.[17] Over time, that has expanded. Currently, all 50 states collect DNA from those convicted of felonies. A number of states also collect samples from juveniles as well as those who are arrested, but not yet convicted, of a crime.[7][18] The collection of arrestee samples raised constitutional issues, specifically the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable search and seizure. It was argued that the collection of DNA from those that were not convicted of a crime, without an explicit order to collect, was considered a warrantless search and therefore unlawful.[19] In 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Maryland v. King that the collection of DNA from those arrested for a crime, but not yet convicted, is part of the police booking procedure and therefore a reasonable collection.[20]\\r\\nThe inheritance pattern of DNA means that close relatives share a higher percentage of alleles between each other than with other, random, members of society.[21] This allows for the searching of close matches within CODIS when an exact match is not found. By focusing on close matches, investigators can potentially find a close relative whose profile is in CODIS narrowing their search to one specific family. Familial searching has led to several convictions after the exhaustion of all other leads including the Grim Sleeper serial killer.[22] This practice also raised Fourth Amendment challenges as the individual who ends up being charged with a crime was only implicated because someone else's DNA was in the CODIS database.[23] So far courts have allowed familial searching results to be used and entered into evidence during court proceedings and as of March 2017[update], eleven states have approved the use of familial searching in CODIS.[24]","input":"Who operated the national combined dna index system?"},{"output":"8 cities","context":"Rhode Island is a state located in the Northeastern United States.

In the town councilÿtown meeting system, there is no fullÿtime chief executive.[4] There are no towns or cities in Rhode Island that use the administratorÿcouncil form of government.\\r\\nThe largest municipality by population in Rhode Island is Providence, the state capital, with 178,042 residents, and the smallest municipality by population is New Shoreham with 1,051 residents.[1] Rhode Island is one of only two states (with Hawaii) in which all of the incorporated municipalities have a population greater than 1,000 people.[1] The largest municipality by land area is Coventry which spans 59.05?sq?mi (152.9?km2), while Central Falls is the smallest at 1.20?sq?mi (3.1?km2).[1]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDowntown Providence, the capital and most populous city in Rhode Island\\r\\nCity Hall of Warwick, the second most populous city in Rhode Island\\r\\nAerial view of Cranston, the third most populous city in Rhode Island\\r\\nDowntown Pawtucket, the fourth most populous city in Rhode Island\\r\\n??State capital \\r\\n[6][7]","input":"How many towns and cities in rhode island?"},{"output":"easterly surface winds","context":"Prevailing winds are winds that blow predominantly from a single general direction over a particular point on the Earth's surface. The dominant winds are the trends in direction of wind with the highest speed over a particular point on the Earth's surface. A region's prevailing and dominant winds are enacted by global patterns of movement in the Earth's atmosphere.[1] In general, easterly flow occurs at low and medium latitudes globally. In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds are the rule and their strength is largely determined by the polar cyclone. In areas where winds tend to be light, the sea breeze/land breeze cycle is the most important to the prevailing wind; in areas which have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes dominate the wind pattern. Highly elevated surfaces can induce a thermal low, which then augments the environmental wind flow.\\r\\nWind roses are tools used to determine the direction of the prevailing wind. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development of prevention strategies for wind erosion of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA wind rose is a graphic tool used by meteorologists to give a succinct view of how wind speed and direction are typically distributed at a particular location. Presented in a polar coordinate grid, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions. The length of each spoke around the circle is related to the frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction per unit time. Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, emanating from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles. A wind rose plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind direction ranges. Wind roses typically use 8 or 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc.,[2] although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions.[3]\\r\\nThe trade winds (also called trades) are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics near the Earth's equator,[4] equatorward of the subtropical ridge. These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] The trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical cyclones that form over world's oceans, guiding their path westward.[6] Trade winds also steer African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean sea, as well as portions of southeast North America.[7]\\r\\nThe westerlies or the prevailing westerlies are the prevailing winds in the middle latitudes (i.e., between 35 and 65 degrees latitude), which blow in areas poleward of the high pressure area known as the subtropical ridge in the horse latitudes.[8][9] These prevailing winds blow from the west to the east,[10] and steer extra-tropical cyclones in this general manner. The winds are predominantly from the southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and from the northwest in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] They are strongest in the winter when the pressure is lower over the poles, such as when the polar cyclone is strongest, and weakest during the summer when the polar cyclone is weakest and when pressures are higher over the poles.[11]\\r\\nTogether with the trade winds, the westerlies enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as the westerlies lead to the development of strong ocean currents in both hemispheres. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are called the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50 degrees south latitude, within the Southern Hemisphere.[12] The westerlies play an important role in carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents,[13][14] especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.\\r\\nThe westerlies explain why coastal North America tends to be wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure and tends to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.[8][9]\\r\\nThe polar easterlies (also known as Polar Hadley cells) are the dry, cold prevailing winds that blow from the high-pressure areas of the polar highs at the North and South Poles towards the low-pressure areas within the westerlies at high latitudes. Like trade winds and unlike the westerlies, these prevailing winds blow from the east to the west, and are often weak and irregular.[15] Due to the low sun angle, cold air builds up and subsides at the pole creating surface high-pressure areas, forcing an outflow of air toward the equator;[16] that outflow is deflected westward by the Coriolis effect.\\r\\nIn areas where the wind flow is light, sea breezes and land breezes are important factors in a location's prevailing winds. The sea is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater specific heat.[17] The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it. The warm air is less dense and so it rises. This rising air over the land lowers the sea level pressure by about 0.2%. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards the land into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast.\\r\\nThe strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an off-shore wind of 8 knots (15?km/h) exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop. At night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean due to differences in their specific heat values, which forces the daytime sea breeze to dissipate. If the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.[18]\\r\\nOver elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated thermal low over the terrain and enhancing any lows which would have otherwise existed,[19][20] and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind can change direction and accelerate parallel to the wind obstruction. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%.[21] In mountainous areas, local distortion of the airflow is more severe. Jagged terrain combines to produce unpredictable flow patterns and turbulence, such as rotors. Strong updrafts, downdrafts and eddies develop as the air flows over hills and down valleys. Wind direction changes due to the contour of the land. If there is a pass in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed due to the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes.[22]\\r\\nDaytime heating and nighttime cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night variations in the airflow, similar to the relationship between sea breeze and land breeze. At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, blowing down into the valley, drawn by gravity. This is known a katabatic wind or mountain breeze. If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.[23]\\r\\nOrographic precipitation occurs on the windward side of mountains and is caused by the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.[24]\\r\\nIn South America, the Andes mountain range blocks Pacific moisture that arrives in that continent, resulting in a desertlike climate just downwind across western Argentina.[25] The Sierra Nevada range creates the same effect in North America forming the Great Basin and Mojave Deserts.[26][27]\\r\\nInsects are swept along by the prevailing winds, while birds follow their own course.[28] As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns.[29] In the Great Plains, wind erosion of agricultural land is a significant problem, and is mainly driven by the prevailing wind. Because of this, wind barrier strips have been developed to minimize this type of erosion. The strips can be in the form of soil ridges, crop strips, crops rows, or trees which act as wind breaks. They are oriented perpendicular to the wind in order to be most effective.[30] In regions with minimal vegetation, such as coastal and desert areas, transverse sand dunes orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, while longitudinal dunes orient themselves parallel to the prevailing winds.[31]","input":"What is the prevalent wind flow in the tropics?"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},M={class:"card-container"};function x(h,t,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),o(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Q&A Life🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",M,[(a(!0),o(l,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(a(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const P=d(B,[["render",x]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"qapage/27.md","filePath":"qapage/27.md"}'),R={name:"qapage/27.md"},H=Object.assign(R,{setup(h){return(t,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{D as __pageData,H as default};
